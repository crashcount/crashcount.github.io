Same ending.</p><ul><li>A 46‑year‑old pedestrian was killed by a southbound box truck at Maspeth and Morgan. The record shows &ldquo;crush injuries&rdquo; and “apparent death.” It happened at 7:58 a.m. on August 6. The truck kept going straight. The man was not in a crosswalk. The truck’s impact point was the right rear quarter of the box. That is all the city dataset gives us (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4833207</a>).</li><li>Five months earlier, a dump truck turned left and killed a pedestrian in a crosswalk at Woodpoint and Withers. The database calls the injury “crush” and the action “crossing with signal.” The truck&rsquo;s right front bumper hit. The victim died there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4796530</a>).</li><li>In March, another left turn at Union and Scholes ended a 72‑year‑old man’s life. The vehicle was making a left. The undercarriage shows the strike point (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4808695</a>).</li></ul><p>Heavy vehicles. Turning movements. People on foot. The same script.</p><h3 id=three-corners-one-fix>Three corners. One fix.</h3><p>The district’s worst pain shows up on a few names you know. <strong>Morgan Avenue</strong>. <strong>Flushing Avenue</strong>. <strong>Union Avenue</strong>. Morgan is tied to three deaths and 47 injuries. Flushing shows 88 injuries tied to one death. Union has two deaths and 13 injuries. These are the city’s own tallies for this map slice (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>).</p><p>The harm peaks in the dark and at the edges of the day. Deaths cluster at 3 a.m., 7 a.m., 8 a.m., 9 a.m., and 7 p.m. Injuries swell from mid‑afternoon through the evening rush and into night (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>Trucks and buses hit fewer people than cars, but when they hit, people die. In this district slice, trucks account for 24 pedestrian strikes and <strong>four pedestrian deaths</strong>; SUVs and cars account for 383 strikes and two deaths. The dataset is blunt about the body count (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle rollup</a>).</p><h3 id=what-the-numbers-say>What the numbers say</h3><p>From 2022 through August 24, 2025, this area saw 6,190 crashes, 2,873 injuries, and <strong>15 deaths</strong>. Pedestrians: six dead, 467 injured. Cyclists: three dead, 483 injured. People on mopeds and other small devices are in the ledger too. The worst hours hit when most people are on foot or bike, or when streets go dim (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district totals</a>).</p><p>The last 12 months: seven killed. Year‑to‑date deaths are up from one to six against the same period last year, a 500% jump.

The bill says, “the department shall complete the installation… by no later than 60 days.” It sits in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>).</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, the DOT told lawmakers to wait years for a full redesign. Brooklyn’s borough president called the corridor “one of the most dangerous” and urged a road diet and the full safety toolkit. The agency offered paint and planters. Residents spoke about fear and blind turns (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>Streetsblog hearing coverage</a>).</p><h3 id=local-fixes-on-the-table>Local fixes on the table</h3><ul><li>Harden left turns at Union, Flushing, Morgan. Concrete, tight radii, and slower entries reduce turning kills. The deaths at Withers/Woodpoint and Scholes/Union were both left turns (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4796530</a>; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4808695</a>).</li><li>Daylight and protect crossings on <strong>Flushing Avenue</strong> and <strong>Morgan Avenue</strong>, named hotspots with recurring injuries and deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>).</li><li>Target heavy vehicles. The district’s pedestrian deaths skew to trucks.

A citywide 20 mph default is on the table. The Council and DOT already cite lower speed limits as life‑saving in new 20 mph slow zones. DOT’s own commissioner said, “Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.” That line backed Dumbo’s 20 mph rollout after Sammy’s Law passed (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/speed-limit-lowered-dumbo-slow-zone/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</li><li>Stop repeat speeders. State legislators pitched mandatory speed limiters for the worst offenders this year. Sponsors said the devices would keep cars from becoming “a deadly weapon,” and that “we have the tools and the knowledge to prevent these tragedies.” Families for Safe Streets backed the bill (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/brooklyn-crash-speed-limiters-reckless-drivers/>amNY</a>).</li></ul><p>This district’s map is a ledger of left turns, truck fronts, and bodies in crosswalks. The fixes are not secrets. They are waiting.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall to lower speeds and use the tools we already have.

The lane, installed after high crash rates and pedestrian deaths, was set for removal until the court's emergency order. The Department of Transportation admitted, "The City risks legal liability for knowingly reducing safety on a Vision Zero priority corridor." Advocates and families appealed, citing the lane’s role in protecting vulnerable road users.

The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles.

Seddio claims the lane will only shift location and disputes the safety benefits, arguing, 'The bike lane will still exist, but merely shift to an alternative location in the road.' He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%. The case highlights ongoing tension between local political power, city notification procedures, and efforts to protect cyclists and pedestrians through street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
