Eleven suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a door that will never open again.</p><p>Just days ago, a man was struck and dragged more than 50 feet on Broadway in Bushwick. The driver fled. Police found the man dying in the street. They are still looking for the one who killed him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Police were looking for the driver of a car that struck and dragged a 47-year-old man on a Brooklyn street over the weekend, killing him.</a> The victim&rsquo;s name has not been released. The city has not said if he was in a crosswalk. It does not matter. He is dead. The driver is gone.</p><p>On Morgan Avenue, a box truck killed a pedestrian crossing near Sharon Street. No marked crosswalk. No protection. This is the third fatal crash on Morgan in three years. Juan Ignacio Serra, a local, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed.</a> The city has not acted. The avenue remains a gauntlet for anyone on foot or bike.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h2><p><strong>District 34 saw 1,725 crashes in the last 12 months.</strong> Seven dead. Eleven with life-altering injuries. The toll is rising. Last year, there were zero deaths in the same period. Now there are seven. Injuries are up by a third. Serious injuries up by almost half. The disaster is not sudden. It is slow, grinding, and relentless.</p><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. <strong>Two deaths and 375 injuries came from sedans and SUVs.</strong> Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. No one is safe. Not the young, not the old. Not the ones crossing with the light. Not the ones just trying to get home.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has co-sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, forcing the city to install daylighting barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. The bill sits in committee. The city waits. The dead do not. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>See the bill</a>.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it. The city can redesign streets. It has not moved fast enough. The city can protect the most vulnerable. It has not.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Gutiérrez. Demand the city clear every crosswalk, lower every speed limit, and build streets that do not kill. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood is already on the street. Make sure it stops here.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill would “require the NYC Department of Transportation to complete installation of any necessary traffic calming device or traffic control device on any street adjacent to a school, in no more than 60 days after DOT issues its traffic study determination.” It amends Administrative Code §19-188.2 by adding subdivision d. The mandate follows a DOT study and excludes devices installed as part of a “major transportation project” under §19-101.2. Faster fixes on school blocks.

The city planned to move cyclists next to car traffic, but the court granted an emergency restraining order after advocates appealed. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the lane a 'critical safety project.' City Hall insists the reconfiguration is legal and claims the appeal delays 'easing the safety concerns plaguing Williamsburg parents.'
