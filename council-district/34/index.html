In the last twelve months, four people died and nine more were left with serious injuries on these roads (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers do not blink: 1,436 crashes, 696 injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared. Trucks and cars do most of the killing. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty beds, and shoes left behind at the curb.</p><p>A man in his twenties, crouched to pick up food, was struck and killed by a dump truck on Withers Street. The driver left him in the road and kept going. Police are still looking for him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Police said the driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene. No arrests have been announced, and the NYPD&rsquo;s Highway District&rsquo;s Collision Investigation Squad is still investigating.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has signed her name to safety. She co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and add speed humps near parks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). She stood with neighbors demanding a 20 mph speed limit for Greenpoint and Williamsburg (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/06/greenpoint-and-williamsburg-beg-dot-for-20mph-slow-zone>advocates demanded a 20 mph speed limit</a>).</p><p>But the street is still hungry. The redesign of Scott Avenue came only after a motorcyclist was killed. The city will now ban cars on a stretch, remove parking at corners, and build a concrete pedestrian island. DOT says these changes can cut deaths and injuries by almost half. Gutiérrez said there was little pushback: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/28/city-to-fix-dangerous-bushwick-intersection-where-driver-killed-motorcyclist>&ldquo;We have seen increased foot traffic and have not received much negative feedback.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-work-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Work Ahead: No More Waiting</h3><p>The bodies keep coming. The fixes come slow. Every delay is another family broken. The city has the power to lower speed limits now. The council can demand more daylight at corners, more protected lanes, more enforcement against reckless drivers. But none of it matters if the laws sit on paper and the street stays the same.</p><p>Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Scott Avenue becomes a pedestrian plaza. DOT aims to cut crashes and deaths. Advocates and officials back the plan. The site saw 39 crashes in four years. Change comes after a fatality.</p><p class=mb3>On April 28, 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a street redesign for Scott Avenue in Bushwick, Brooklyn, following a fatal crash that killed motorcyclist Philippe Haussmann last August. The plan, supported by Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez and Transportation Alternatives, bans cars on a short stretch between Flushing and Johnson Avenues and removes parking at several corners for better visibility—a process known as daylighting. DOT will also narrow Scott Avenue further south and build a concrete pedestrian peninsula at Troutman Street, banning right turns onto Scott. The intersection, described as a 'crash hotspot' with 39 incidents since 2020, will see expanded pedestrian space and improved safety. Gutierrez noted increased foot traffic and little negative feedback. DOT claims the redesign can reduce deaths and serious injuries by up to 45 percent for pedestrians. Advocates say the changes will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, introduced April 24, 2025, calls for 'requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits.' Council Member Lincoln Restler leads, joined by Salaam, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Banks, and Brannan. The bill would force drivers with eleven or more points in eighteen months, or six speed/red light camera tickets in a year, to install speed-limiting tech. The Council cites data: 265 killed, 52,949 injured on city streets in 2023. The measure aims to put a brake on reckless driving. The committee has not yet advanced the resolution.

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds.

Advocates demand equal pay and protection.</p><p class=mb3>On December 4, 2024, Council Members Jennifer Gutiérrez and Sandy Nurse introduced bills to the City Council’s Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection. The bills aim to close a loophole that lets grocery delivery apps like Instacart avoid paying the $20 per hour minimum wage required for restaurant deliveristas. The matter title: 'Council Seeks To Expand Minimum Wage to Grocery Deliveristas.' The hearing is scheduled for December 9. Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the Immigration Committee, called for broader protections: 'When you become a worker, you should be ensured a living wage.' Ligia Guallpa of Worker’s Justice Project said all delivery workers face significant risks and deserve safety, dignity, and respect. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection supports expanding the wage standard. Instacart opposes the bill. The Council’s action centers gig workers who ride city streets, exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece, titled 'Eliminating ‘parking minimums’ in NYC can help ease the housing crisis,' argues that required parking spaces in new developments block affordable housing and favor cars over people. Bottcher writes, 'By eliminating parking minimums, we can unlock the potential for more housing units in buildings across the city.' He highlights that parking mandates raise construction costs, limit design, and disrupt street life. Bottcher’s call joins a national trend: cities like Minneapolis and Buffalo have already scrapped these rules. The op-ed claims that ending parking minimums will promote walking, cycling, and transit, making streets safer and more welcoming for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights.
