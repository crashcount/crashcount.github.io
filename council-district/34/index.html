From 2014 to 2020, eleven people were killed or severely injured on Meeker Avenue. The lane remains incomplete, with 'unsignalized intersections, incomplete lane markings, a dangerously designed right-of-way, and an overall lack of proper maintenance.' Trucks block crossings, and drivers stop in bike paths. DOT has not added the route to the official bike map, citing safety concerns. The agency’s inaction leaves a critical corridor unsafe for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
