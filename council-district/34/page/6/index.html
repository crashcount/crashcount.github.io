Ten left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, 708 hurt, 1,435 crashes—each one a story that ends in pain or silence. The dead do not speak. The living limp, or grieve, or wait for justice that never comes.</p><p>A man kneels to pick up food on Withers Street. A dump truck turns. He is gone. The driver leaves.

The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-votes-and-the-slow-grind-of-change>Leadership: Promises, Votes, and the Slow Grind of Change</h3><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has signed her name to bills that promise safer streets. She backed the SAFE Streets Act, the push for 20 mph speed limits, and the ban on parking near crosswalks. She voted to legalize crossing mid-block, ending the old blame game against walkers. She stood with neighbors for a safer McGuinness Boulevard. She called for daylight at corners where drivers once hid behind parked cars.</p><p>But the blood keeps running. <strong>Bills sit in committee. Promises wait for a vote.</strong> The city talks of redesigns, but corners stay blind, and trucks still turn wide. The law moves slow. The street moves fast.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can daylight every corner. It can build real protection for people on foot and bike. It can act, or it can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait for you.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

System grows in power, not reach.</p><p class=mb3>On November 6, 2023, the Adams Administration and Lyft announced amendments to the Citi Bike contract, which runs through 2029. The deal, covered in Streetsblog NYC, doubles e-bikes from 10,000 to 20,000 and adds new and replacement classic bikes. The matter summary states, 'No system expansion... you're not going to be able to ride the bikes anywhere new because system expansion was not part of the amendment agreement.' Council members were not directly named, but Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso praised electrification, saying, 'This is exactly the direction we should be moving in—toward greener, safer, and more accessible micromobility options for New Yorkers.' John Tomac of Bike South Brooklyn condemned the lack of expansion: 'We're disappointed that you still can’t ride a Citi Bike in most of New York City.' The contract introduces price caps but avoids public funding. The city’s refusal to expand or subsidize Citi Bike leaves many vulnerable road users in transit deserts, with safer, greener options still out of reach.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents demanded speed bumps and crossing guards. The crash came as the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and crossing guard positions were cut.

The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements.

The Department of Transportation's new plan, described as a 'compromised version,' adds protected bike lanes but keeps two car lanes during peak hours from Calyer Street to the Pulaski Bridge. The matter, titled 'Relief in Greenpoint as compromise reached on McGuinness Boulevard redesign,' reflects years of advocacy for safer streets. Restler, along with Borough President Reynoso and others, welcomed the changes and pledged to push for swift implementation. Advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe criticized the compromise as 'less effective and less safe,' blaming business opposition for watering down the original plan. The compromise marks a partial win for vulnerable road users, but falls short of the full road diet advocates demanded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler, who represents the area, stated he is an unequivocal 'no' on the expansion and wants a use that benefits the community. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso urged the city to discourage private vehicles, citing high pedestrian traffic and strong transit access. City Planning Commissioner Juan Camilo Osorio highlighted policies to cut car use and decarbonize the city.

They called the crash 'entirely predictable' and demanded Mayor Adams immediately implement the Department of Transportation’s stalled safety redesign. The DOT’s plan, which includes narrowing the street and adding a protected bike lane, faces opposition from powerful donors. The mayor’s office claims traffic safety is a priority, but the plan remains in limbo.
