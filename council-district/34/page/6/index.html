These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement and families left with empty chairs. In the last twelve months alone, six more people died. Twelve were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same again.</p><p>Just this spring, a 42-year-old man was killed crossing Withers Street with the signal. A dump truck turned left and crushed him (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). He was doing everything right. The truck kept going. The city kept moving.</p><h3 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—<strong>369 incidents</strong>. Trucks and buses follow, with <strong>40 more</strong>. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the real danger comes on four wheels or more (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The pattern is old. The pain is fresh. A cyclist was struck by a turning driver on McGuinness Boulevard just days ago. The bike lane was only paint. The city had promised more. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p><strong>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks</strong>—a move to daylight intersections and save lives (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). The bill would force the city to clear at least 1,000 crosswalks a year. It sits in committee. The city waits. The dead do not.</p><p><strong>The work is not done.</strong> Every delay is another risk. Every watered-down promise is another family shattered. The city can move faster. The council can demand more. The mayor can act. But only if you make them.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong> Call Council Member Gutiérrez. Demand the passage and funding of the daylighting bill. Demand protected bike lanes, not just paint. Demand a city where crossing the street is not a gamble with your life.</p><p><strong>If you do nothing, nothing will change.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, now before the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was highlighted in an op-ed published November 13, 2023. Avilés, as committee chair, wrote, 'An overhaul of our truck route map is long overdue. We must pass Introduction 708 for the sake of our communities and all New Yorkers.' The measure would require the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to improve safety, visibility, and reduce congestion and emissions. It also mandates input from neighborhoods, environmental groups, and industry. Avilés leads a coalition of 40 co-sponsors, with support from Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. The bill responds to the surge in freight traffic, which has battered streets and put vulnerable communities—often communities of color—at risk. The current map, unchanged since the 1970s, routes heavy trucks through residential areas, increasing danger for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

System grows in power, not reach.</p><p class=mb3>On November 6, 2023, the Adams Administration and Lyft announced amendments to the Citi Bike contract, which runs through 2029. The deal, covered in Streetsblog NYC, doubles e-bikes from 10,000 to 20,000 and adds new and replacement classic bikes. The matter summary states, 'No system expansion... you're not going to be able to ride the bikes anywhere new because system expansion was not part of the amendment agreement.' Council members were not directly named, but Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso praised electrification, saying, 'This is exactly the direction we should be moving in—toward greener, safer, and more accessible micromobility options for New Yorkers.' John Tomac of Bike South Brooklyn condemned the lack of expansion: 'We're disappointed that you still can’t ride a Citi Bike in most of New York City.' The contract introduces price caps but avoids public funding. The city’s refusal to expand or subsidize Citi Bike leaves many vulnerable road users in transit deserts, with safer, greener options still out of reach.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

But after a tow truck driver killed 7-year-old Kamei Hughes near Fort Greene Park, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Crystal Hudson withdrew. In their open letter, they wrote, 'Holding a forum where Vision Zero will be criticized in the neighborhood next to where a young boy’s life was lost to traffic violence sends the wrong message to the community and to our borough.' The church, led by Rev. Anthony Trufant, canceled the meeting. Local residents called for more enforcement against reckless drivers.

The matter, as reported, centers on public frustration: 'Adams had previously promised to do "whatever it takes to keep our streets safe" after the child’s death.' Council Member Crystal Hudson and Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for urgent safety improvements. A Brooklyn parent’s letter demanding action drew 1,800 signatures in days.

The crash happened near Fort Greene Park, where witnesses reported the driver was speeding, using her phone, and dragged the child before stopping. The intersection’s visibility was blocked by a legally parked car, as New York City exempts itself from state daylighting rules. Council Member Crystal Hudson visited the scene, spoke with police and residents, and acknowledged a pattern of reckless tow truck driving. Hudson said, 'This is the worst possible outcome, and, yet, we are forced to reckon with the worst possible outcome at the hands of the NYPD all too often.' Residents demanded speed bumps and crossing guards. The crash came as the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and crossing guard positions were cut. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for an end to 'senseless traffic violence.'

State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety.

The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded.
