In the last twelve months, four people died and nine more were left with serious injuries on these roads (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers do not blink: 1,436 crashes, 696 injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared. Trucks and cars do most of the killing. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty beds, and shoes left behind at the curb.</p><p>A man in his twenties, crouched to pick up food, was struck and killed by a dump truck on Withers Street. The driver left him in the road and kept going. Police are still looking for him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Police said the driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene. No arrests have been announced, and the NYPD&rsquo;s Highway District&rsquo;s Collision Investigation Squad is still investigating.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has signed her name to safety. She co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and add speed humps near parks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). She stood with neighbors demanding a 20 mph speed limit for Greenpoint and Williamsburg (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/06/greenpoint-and-williamsburg-beg-dot-for-20mph-slow-zone>advocates demanded a 20 mph speed limit</a>).</p><p>But the street is still hungry. The redesign of Scott Avenue came only after a motorcyclist was killed. The city will now ban cars on a stretch, remove parking at corners, and build a concrete pedestrian island. DOT says these changes can cut deaths and injuries by almost half. Gutiérrez said there was little pushback: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/28/city-to-fix-dangerous-bushwick-intersection-where-driver-killed-motorcyclist>&ldquo;We have seen increased foot traffic and have not received much negative feedback.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-work-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Work Ahead: No More Waiting</h3><p>The bodies keep coming. The fixes come slow. Every delay is another family broken. The city has the power to lower speed limits now. The council can demand more daylight at corners, more protected lanes, more enforcement against reckless drivers. But none of it matters if the laws sit on paper and the street stays the same.</p><p>Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

At least 450 corridors must be contiguous to others with new or existing lighting. Council Member Selvena N.

The bill demands a study on 'the feasibility of installing raised crosswalks, raised intersections, and speed reducers at intersections and roadways adjacent to schools.' Council Member Julie Menin leads, joined by Schulman, Hudson, Brooks-Powers, Riley, Lee, Louis, Restler, and Gutiérrez as sponsors. The bill would repeal and replace Section 19-189 of the city code, requiring the Department of Transportation to report crash data and feasibility findings to the Mayor and Council Speaker. After the study, the Commissioner may install traffic-calming measures where possible. The bill remains 'Laid Over in Committee' as of June 25, 2024. No safety analyst note is available, but the bill targets systemic risk where children walk and drivers speed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gutiérrez said, 'We remain committed to enhancing public safety and ensuring that the nightlife community operates and maintains responsible practices.' The push centers vulnerable road users—pedestrians and nightlife patrons—who face systemic danger in neglected, poorly lit streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The city’s crosswalks remain unchanged. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On July 18, 2023, Council Member Shahana Hanif and other Brooklyn officials called for 'equalized tolling on all crossings into Manhattan' as congestion pricing nears. Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event followed Mayor Adams' reversal of a previously approved plan, which came after a fatal 2021 hit-and-run. The rally, organized by Make McGuinness Safe, drew support from Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez and Lincoln Restler. The matter, titled 'Greenpoint to Mayor: We Are the Residents and We Support a Safer McGuinness!', saw speakers denounce the influence of the Argento family and Broadway Stages, who opposed the redesign to protect business interests. Residents cited high crash and injury rates, especially for children crossing to local schools. DOT is now refining the plan based on community feedback. The message was clear: Greenpoint wants action, not delay, to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
