Eight hundred twenty-eight injured.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in District 34 in the last year alone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Crashes do not care about age. The dead include a 65-year-old, a 35-year-old, a 25-year-old. The wounded are children, elders, and everyone in between. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families left waiting for someone who will never come home.</p><p>Just days ago, a man was struck and killed crossing Broadway at Suydam Street. The driver did not stop. Police found the man dead in the road. The vehicle, maybe a garbage truck, kept going. Police are still looking for the driver. The victim’s name is not public yet. The silence is heavy. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian crossing a Brooklyn street, then left the scene, police said Sunday.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-bodies>Broken Promises, Broken Bodies</h3><p><strong>The violence is relentless.</strong> In the last twelve months, crashes have jumped nearly 20%. Injuries are up almost 29%. Serious injuries climbed 40%. The city’s answer? More studies. More waiting. The street stays the same. The blood dries. The next crash comes.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks and force the city to clear sightlines at a thousand intersections a year. The bill sits in committee, waiting (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see the bill</a>). The work is not done. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Gutiérrez. Demand a vote on the daylighting bill. Demand more than studies and promises. Demand action that saves lives, not just headlines. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police said Yarimi’s license was suspended. The car first hit a Toyota Camry, then continued forward, hitting the family in the crosswalk. The article quotes NYPD Commissioner Tisch: 'This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.' Yarimi faces multiple charges, including manslaughter and aggravated unlicensed operation. The crash left a young boy in critical condition and injured another family.

The cyclist, who was helmetless, was crushed between two station wagons/SUVs. The report states, 'His arm split open. Blood pooled. One driver stayed. The other vanished.' The cyclist suffered severe lacerations to his lower arm and hand and was partially ejected from his bike. According to the police report, driver errors played a central role: 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' are listed as contributing factors. One SUV was stopped in traffic, while the other was parked. The cyclist was traveling straight ahead when the crash occurred. The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver errors that led to the crash. The focus remains on the systemic dangers and driver actions that resulted in the cyclist's injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) declined to commit to a full redesign of a deadly 13-block stretch, despite pressure from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Chi Ossé. Both made redesign a condition for supporting a major rezoning. The official matter: 'The administration must commit to a fully-funded redesign of Atlantic Avenue from Flatbush Avenue in the west to Nostrand Avenue in the east.' DOT’s Brooklyn Borough Planner, Dash Henley, promised only an 18-month traffic study and minor intersection tweaks, projecting a seven-to-ten-year wait for real change. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso joined calls for traffic calming and lane reallocation. From 2021 to 2024, four people died and 473 were injured here. Advocates and council members want protected bike lanes and road diets.

The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, “After the crash, Epps hopped in a taxi and took off, leaving his 26-year-old passenger, Imani Vance, in the front seat suffering severe head trauma.” Epps faces charges of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, leaving the scene, and unlicensed driving. The bus driver survived. The crash exposes ongoing risks from unlicensed, reckless drivers and the persistent danger at city intersections.

According to the police report, 'a dump truck turned left. Its right bumper struck a baby boy crossing with the signal. He died there, crushed beneath steel and weight.' The report states the point of impact was the right front bumper of the truck. The child, a pedestrian, suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. The police narrative explicitly notes the victim was 'crossing with the signal.' The driver’s actions—executing a left turn in a large vehicle—placed the most vulnerable road user in mortal danger. The report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the victim, but the sequence of events centers the dump truck’s left turn and the resulting impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers.

Reynoso’s recommendations—outlined in his official statement—include a road diet, pedestrian and cyclist upgrades, and paid parking. He criticized DOT’s lack of detail, saying, 'Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum.' The Atlantic Avenue Mixed Use Plan, now heading to a Department of City Planning hearing, would rezone 13 blocks and remove parking minimums for new housing. Council Member Crystal Hudson acknowledged the community’s demand for safety but stopped short of backing a road diet. DOT has promised some safety tweaks—painted neckdowns, daylighting, planters, a new bike lane—but not a full redesign. Advocates and Transportation Alternatives call for protected bike lanes and pedestrian plazas. Reynoso’s push highlights the gap between incremental fixes and the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
