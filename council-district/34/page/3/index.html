Eleven suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a door that will never open again.</p><p>Just days ago, a man was struck and dragged more than 50 feet on Broadway in Bushwick. The driver fled. Police found the man dying in the street. They are still looking for the one who killed him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Police were looking for the driver of a car that struck and dragged a 47-year-old man on a Brooklyn street over the weekend, killing him.</a> The victim&rsquo;s name has not been released. The city has not said if he was in a crosswalk. It does not matter. He is dead. The driver is gone.</p><p>On Morgan Avenue, a box truck killed a pedestrian crossing near Sharon Street. No marked crosswalk. No protection. This is the third fatal crash on Morgan in three years. Juan Ignacio Serra, a local, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed.</a> The city has not acted. The avenue remains a gauntlet for anyone on foot or bike.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h2><p><strong>District 34 saw 1,725 crashes in the last 12 months.</strong> Seven dead. Eleven with life-altering injuries. The toll is rising. Last year, there were zero deaths in the same period. Now there are seven. Injuries are up by a third. Serious injuries up by almost half. The disaster is not sudden. It is slow, grinding, and relentless.</p><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. <strong>Two deaths and 375 injuries came from sedans and SUVs.</strong> Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. No one is safe. Not the young, not the old. Not the ones crossing with the light. Not the ones just trying to get home.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has co-sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, forcing the city to install daylighting barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. The bill sits in committee. The city waits. The dead do not. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>See the bill</a>.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it. The city can redesign streets. It has not moved fast enough. The city can protect the most vulnerable. It has not.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Gutiérrez. Demand the city clear every crosswalk, lower every speed limit, and build streets that do not kill. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood is already on the street. Make sure it stops here.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police said Yarimi had a suspended license and turned right at a red light, colliding with a Toyota Camry before hitting the family. The article quotes NYPD Commissioner Tisch: 'This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.' Yarimi faces multiple charges, including manslaughter and aggravated unlicensed operation. The crash also injured another family in the Toyota. The incident highlights persistent dangers for pedestrians and the systemic risk posed by unlicensed drivers on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The cyclist, who was helmetless, was crushed between two station wagons/SUVs. The report states, 'His arm split open. Blood pooled. One driver stayed. The other vanished.' The cyclist suffered severe lacerations to his lower arm and hand and was partially ejected from his bike. According to the police report, driver errors played a central role: 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' are listed as contributing factors. One SUV was stopped in traffic, while the other was parked. The cyclist was traveling straight ahead when the crash occurred. The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver errors that led to the crash. The focus remains on the systemic dangers and driver actions that resulted in the cyclist's injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) declined to commit to a full redesign of a deadly 13-block stretch, despite pressure from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Chi Ossé. Both made redesign a condition for supporting a major rezoning. The official matter: 'The administration must commit to a fully-funded redesign of Atlantic Avenue from Flatbush Avenue in the west to Nostrand Avenue in the east.' DOT’s Brooklyn Borough Planner, Dash Henley, promised only an 18-month traffic study and minor intersection tweaks, projecting a seven-to-ten-year wait for real change. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso joined calls for traffic calming and lane reallocation. From 2021 to 2024, four people died and 473 were injured here.

The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
