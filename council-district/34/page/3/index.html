These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement and families left with empty chairs. In the last twelve months alone, six more people died. Twelve were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same again.</p><p>Just this spring, a 42-year-old man was killed crossing Withers Street with the signal. A dump truck turned left and crushed him (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). He was doing everything right. The truck kept going. The city kept moving.</p><h3 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—<strong>369 incidents</strong>. Trucks and buses follow, with <strong>40 more</strong>. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the real danger comes on four wheels or more (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The pattern is old. The pain is fresh. A cyclist was struck by a turning driver on McGuinness Boulevard just days ago. The bike lane was only paint. The city had promised more. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p><strong>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks</strong>—a move to daylight intersections and save lives (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). The bill would force the city to clear at least 1,000 crosswalks a year. It sits in committee. The city waits. The dead do not.</p><p><strong>The work is not done.</strong> Every delay is another risk. Every watered-down promise is another family shattered. The city can move faster. The council can demand more. The mayor can act. But only if you make them.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong> Call Council Member Gutiérrez. Demand the passage and funding of the daylighting bill. Demand protected bike lanes, not just paint. Demand a city where crossing the street is not a gamble with your life.</p><p><strong>If you do nothing, nothing will change.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) declined to commit to a full redesign of a deadly 13-block stretch, despite pressure from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Chi Ossé. Both made redesign a condition for supporting a major rezoning. The official matter: 'The administration must commit to a fully-funded redesign of Atlantic Avenue from Flatbush Avenue in the west to Nostrand Avenue in the east.' DOT’s Brooklyn Borough Planner, Dash Henley, promised only an 18-month traffic study and minor intersection tweaks, projecting a seven-to-ten-year wait for real change. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso joined calls for traffic calming and lane reallocation. From 2021 to 2024, four people died and 473 were injured here. Advocates and council members want protected bike lanes and road diets.

The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2025, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced the lowering of Dumbo’s speed limit to 20 mph, making it Brooklyn’s first Regional Slow Zone. The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the point of impact was the right front bumper of the truck. The child, a pedestrian, suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body.

Seabrook allegedly crashed a Kia Sportage into a Toyota Yaris carrying Wallace and friends, then fled the scene on foot. Wallace died; two others were critically injured. The Toyota’s driver was also charged with driving without a license. Seabrook faces charges including manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and leaving the scene. The article quotes Wallace’s aunt: “He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered.” The case highlights the deadly consequences of reckless driving and fleeing crash scenes in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The official matter focused on 'excessive illegal parking—including by the local police precinct.' CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers.

Council Members Crystal Hudson and Chi Ossé, along with Borough President Antonio Reynoso, demanded a fully funded redesign, calling Atlantic Avenue 'one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough.' Residents testified about fear and danger from speeding cars and blind turns. From 2021 to 2024, four people died and 473 were injured in 831 crashes.

He criticized DOT’s lack of detail, saying, 'Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum.' The Atlantic Avenue Mixed Use Plan, now heading to a Department of City Planning hearing, would rezone 13 blocks and remove parking minimums for new housing. Council Member Crystal Hudson acknowledged the community’s demand for safety but stopped short of backing a road diet. DOT has promised some safety tweaks—painted neckdowns, daylighting, planters, a new bike lane—but not a full redesign.
