Ten left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, 708 hurt, 1,435 crashes—each one a story that ends in pain or silence. The dead do not speak.

The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-votes-and-the-slow-grind-of-change>Leadership: Promises, Votes, and the Slow Grind of Change</h3><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has signed her name to bills that promise safer streets. She backed the SAFE Streets Act, the push for 20 mph speed limits, and the ban on parking near crosswalks. She voted to legalize crossing mid-block, ending the old blame game against walkers. She stood with neighbors for a safer McGuinness Boulevard. She called for daylight at corners where drivers once hid behind parked cars.</p><p>But the blood keeps running. <strong>Bills sit in committee. Promises wait for a vote.</strong> The city talks of redesigns, but corners stay blind, and trucks still turn wide. The law moves slow. The street moves fast.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can daylight every corner. It can build real protection for people on foot and bike. It can act, or it can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait for you.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Lincoln Restler leads, joined by Salaam, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Banks, and Brannan. The bill would force drivers with eleven or more points in eighteen months, or six speed/red light camera tickets in a year, to install speed-limiting tech. The Council cites data: 265 killed, 52,949 injured on city streets in 2023. The measure aims to put a brake on reckless driving. The committee has not yet advanced the resolution.

Seabrook had been out on bail for a previous crash involving police. On January 8, 2024, he crashed into a Toyota, killing Hayden Wallace and injuring three others. Seabrook fled the scene, abandoning his vehicle. The article notes, "All accidents are useless but this one was even more useless because [Seabrook] had so many other offenses." Seabrook faces 23 charges, including manslaughter, leaving the scene, unlicensed driving, and speeding. The case highlights repeated driver offenses and questions about bail and enforcement. Police needed over a year to arrest Seabrook, who had a history of fleeing crashes and driving without a license.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2025, Brooklyn Community Board 1 voted 18-15 to request a 20 mph speed limit for Greenpoint and Williamsburg. The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'a dump truck turned left. Its right bumper struck a baby boy crossing with the signal. He died there, crushed beneath steel and weight.' The report states the point of impact was the right front bumper of the truck. The child, a pedestrian, suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. The police narrative explicitly notes the victim was 'crossing with the signal.' The driver’s actions—executing a left turn in a large vehicle—placed the most vulnerable road user in mortal danger. The report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the victim, but the sequence of events centers the dump truck’s left turn and the resulting impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.' Council Member Sandy Nurse’s district saw mandates shaped by community board amendments, not her advocacy. Dan Garodnick, Department of City Planning chair, said, 'parking and housing are no longer coming into conflict in the parts of New York City that are well-served by transit.' The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others.
