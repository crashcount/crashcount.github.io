In the last twelve months, four people died and nine more were left with serious injuries on these roads (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers do not blink: 1,436 crashes, 696 injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared. Trucks and cars do most of the killing. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty beds, and shoes left behind at the curb.</p><p>A man in his twenties, crouched to pick up food, was struck and killed by a dump truck on Withers Street. The driver left him in the road and kept going. Police are still looking for him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Police said the driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene. No arrests have been announced, and the NYPD&rsquo;s Highway District&rsquo;s Collision Investigation Squad is still investigating.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has signed her name to safety. She co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and add speed humps near parks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). She stood with neighbors demanding a 20 mph speed limit for Greenpoint and Williamsburg (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/06/greenpoint-and-williamsburg-beg-dot-for-20mph-slow-zone>advocates demanded a 20 mph speed limit</a>).</p><p>But the street is still hungry. The redesign of Scott Avenue came only after a motorcyclist was killed. The city will now ban cars on a stretch, remove parking at corners, and build a concrete pedestrian island. DOT says these changes can cut deaths and injuries by almost half. Gutiérrez said there was little pushback: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/28/city-to-fix-dangerous-bushwick-intersection-where-driver-killed-motorcyclist>&ldquo;We have seen increased foot traffic and have not received much negative feedback.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-work-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Work Ahead: No More Waiting</h3><p>The bodies keep coming. The fixes come slow. Every delay is another family broken. The city has the power to lower speed limits now. The council can demand more daylight at corners, more protected lanes, more enforcement against reckless drivers. But none of it matters if the laws sit on paper and the street stays the same.</p><p>Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers push for faster, clearer action where broken concrete endangers lives.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0504-2024, now laid over in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on March 7, 2024. The bill's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing priority for sidewalk repairs at developments operated by the New York city housing authority.' Council Members Alexa Avilés (primary sponsor), Shaun Abreu, Farah N. Louis, Rafael Salamanca, Jr., Lincoln Restler, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Sandy Nurse, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, and Shahana K. Hanif back the measure. The bill forces DOT to fix sidewalks at NYCHA senior housing first, then other NYCHA sites. DOT must also publish repair lists and schedules. The move targets dangerous, crumbling sidewalks where NYCHA residents—especially seniors—face daily risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
