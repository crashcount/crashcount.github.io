The bill sits in committee, waiting. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a></p><p><strong>Every week of delay is another risk.</strong> The city moves slow.

Every crash is a policy failure. Every death is a choice made by those in power. The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end the hiding of drivers behind parked cars.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Gutiérrez. Demand the daylighting bill moves. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p>The blood on the street is not washed away by silence.

The incident highlights ongoing failures in city safety policy. The intersection is described as 'very dangerous,' with fast turns and drivers not yielding. Only 27 percent of the city’s 5,860 heavy garbage trucks have side guards, despite a 2019 city deal requiring them by 2024. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, then a Council Member, said, 'side rails should be installed sooner.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives called for 'bold action' and criticized city officials for delaying redesigns and safety steps.

The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver.

DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, 'We’re expanding our loading zone program to meet the increasing demands of deliveries and cut down on unsafe double parking.' The original bill sought 25% of curb space for loading in dense areas, but the de Blasio administration opposed it. The final law was a compromise.
