Ten left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, 708 hurt, 1,435 crashes—each one a story that ends in pain or silence. The dead do not speak.

The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-votes-and-the-slow-grind-of-change>Leadership: Promises, Votes, and the Slow Grind of Change</h3><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has signed her name to bills that promise safer streets. She backed the SAFE Streets Act, the push for 20 mph speed limits, and the ban on parking near crosswalks. She voted to legalize crossing mid-block, ending the old blame game against walkers. She stood with neighbors for a safer McGuinness Boulevard. She called for daylight at corners where drivers once hid behind parked cars.</p><p>But the blood keeps running. <strong>Bills sit in committee. Promises wait for a vote.</strong> The city talks of redesigns, but corners stay blind, and trucks still turn wide. The law moves slow. The street moves fast.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can daylight every corner. It can build real protection for people on foot and bike. It can act, or it can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait for you.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
