These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement and families left with empty chairs. In the last twelve months alone, six more people died. Twelve were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same again.</p><p>Just this spring, a 42-year-old man was killed crossing Withers Street with the signal. A dump truck turned left and crushed him (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). He was doing everything right. The truck kept going. The city kept moving.</p><h3 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—<strong>369 incidents</strong>. Trucks and buses follow, with <strong>40 more</strong>. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the real danger comes on four wheels or more (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The pattern is old. The pain is fresh. A cyclist was struck by a turning driver on McGuinness Boulevard just days ago. The bike lane was only paint. The city had promised more. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p><strong>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks</strong>—a move to daylight intersections and save lives (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). The bill would force the city to clear at least 1,000 crosswalks a year. It sits in committee. The city waits. The dead do not.</p><p><strong>The work is not done.</strong> Every delay is another risk. Every watered-down promise is another family shattered. The city can move faster. The council can demand more. The mayor can act. But only if you make them.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong> Call Council Member Gutiérrez. Demand the passage and funding of the daylighting bill. Demand protected bike lanes, not just paint. Demand a city where crossing the street is not a gamble with your life.</p><p><strong>If you do nothing, nothing will change.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The session saw progressives sidelined as the Council prioritized car-centric bills, including Intros 103 and 104 (parking protection) and hearings on Intro 606 (e-bike registration). The Common Sense Caucus, known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, led the charge. Progressive members lost key committee seats. Universal daylighting (Intro 1138) and other safety reforms stalled. Council Member Julie Won continued to push for daylighting but faced resistance. As Streetsblog reported, 'roadway safety is simply not a priority.' Advocates and former members criticized the Council for failing to hold the mayor accountable on the Streets Master Plan and for focusing on parking over safety. The Council's actions marked a retreat from previous street safety gains, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Parks Committee and full board both voted unanimously for the $30 million overhaul, which includes $20.97 million for the Shore Road Promenade and $9.25 million for Leif Ericson Park. The project, described as 'Destination: Greenways!', will expand green space, separate bike and pedestrian lanes, add lighting, and install new amenities. Brannan, a key funder and supporter, said, 'Our local parks are the lungs of our city.' The overhaul aims to improve recreational cycling, repair pothole-ridden paths, and increase accessibility. Board members raised concerns about safety and sanitation, which the Parks Department pledged to address in final designs.

Restler stated, 'this is a decision that enhances safety in our community, and that's what matters.'

DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone claimed the redesign will make the corridor safer for all users, with new bike lanes and sidewalk extensions.
