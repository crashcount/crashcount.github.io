Ten left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, 708 hurt, 1,435 crashes—each one a story that ends in pain or silence. The dead do not speak.

The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-votes-and-the-slow-grind-of-change>Leadership: Promises, Votes, and the Slow Grind of Change</h3><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has signed her name to bills that promise safer streets. She backed the SAFE Streets Act, the push for 20 mph speed limits, and the ban on parking near crosswalks. She voted to legalize crossing mid-block, ending the old blame game against walkers. She stood with neighbors for a safer McGuinness Boulevard. She called for daylight at corners where drivers once hid behind parked cars.</p><p>But the blood keeps running. <strong>Bills sit in committee. Promises wait for a vote.</strong> The city talks of redesigns, but corners stay blind, and trucks still turn wide. The law moves slow. The street moves fast.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can daylight every corner. It can build real protection for people on foot and bike. It can act, or it can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait for you.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, described as 'Destination: Greenways!', will expand green space, separate bike and pedestrian lanes, add lighting, and install new amenities. Brannan, a key funder and supporter, said, 'Our local parks are the lungs of our city.' The overhaul aims to improve recreational cycling, repair pothole-ridden paths, and increase accessibility. Board members raised concerns about safety and sanitation, which the Parks Department pledged to address in final designs.

Nydia Velázquez, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso—called for a more thorough redesign, arguing the current plan preserves dangerous elements. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone claimed the redesign will make the corridor safer for all users, with new bike lanes and sidewalk extensions.

He wants fewer spaces, not just fewer mandates. Reynoso pushes for maximums in transit-rich areas. He says car culture drives danger. He demands bold action.</p><p class=mb3>On July 17, 2024, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso issued a policy recommendation urging Mayor Adams to strengthen the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity rezoning proposal. Reynoso wants the city to set strict maximums on parking spaces in new developments, especially near transit. The matter summary states, 'Our recommendation is to remove as much parking as possible, but [if a] developer feels an obligation to put in a certain amount of parking, there should be a maximum allowable in transit-rich areas.' Reynoso supports eliminating parking mandates but says it is not enough. He points to developers building excess parking even near subways and calls for rules like Manhattan Core’s. Reynoso’s push aims to curb car dependency and promote safer, transit-oriented neighborhoods. He stresses the need to educate the public and break the grip of car culture.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing spotlighted the Commercial Waste Zones law, which aims to cut crashes by limiting private trash haulers in each zone. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, author of the 2019 reform, and Council Member Shaun Abreu led the charge, questioning why companies like Cogent Waste Solutions—with poor safety records—were awarded contracts. Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial. Lawmakers condemned the city for putting cost before safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who led the original reforms as a council member, said, 'Crash data from [commercial waste zone] awardees is good, but crash data from CWZ applicants would have been even better.' The bill aims to end the 'Wild West' of private waste hauling, which killed seven New Yorkers in a single year. The new rules demand real-time telematics, immediate injury reports, and full transparency on crashes. Advocates say the data could help redesign streets and hold dangerous drivers to account.

Justin Wood of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest warned, 'The system cannot achieve transformational change if it is treated as a limited pilot program.' The city’s goal to cut truck miles falls short of original promises. Action Carting, whose driver killed a cyclist in 2017, secured contracts for 14 zones.
