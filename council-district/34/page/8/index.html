Same ending.</p><ul><li>A 46‑year‑old pedestrian was killed by a southbound box truck at Maspeth and Morgan. The record shows &ldquo;crush injuries&rdquo; and “apparent death.” It happened at 7:58 a.m. on August 6. The truck kept going straight. The man was not in a crosswalk. The truck’s impact point was the right rear quarter of the box. That is all the city dataset gives us (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4833207</a>).</li><li>Five months earlier, a dump truck turned left and killed a pedestrian in a crosswalk at Woodpoint and Withers. The database calls the injury “crush” and the action “crossing with signal.” The truck&rsquo;s right front bumper hit. The victim died there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4796530</a>).</li><li>In March, another left turn at Union and Scholes ended a 72‑year‑old man’s life. The vehicle was making a left. The undercarriage shows the strike point (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4808695</a>).</li></ul><p>Heavy vehicles. Turning movements. People on foot. The same script.</p><h3 id=three-corners-one-fix>Three corners. One fix.</h3><p>The district’s worst pain shows up on a few names you know. <strong>Morgan Avenue</strong>. <strong>Flushing Avenue</strong>. <strong>Union Avenue</strong>. Morgan is tied to three deaths and 47 injuries. Flushing shows 88 injuries tied to one death. Union has two deaths and 13 injuries. These are the city’s own tallies for this map slice (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>).</p><p>The harm peaks in the dark and at the edges of the day. Deaths cluster at 3 a.m., 7 a.m., 8 a.m., 9 a.m., and 7 p.m. Injuries swell from mid‑afternoon through the evening rush and into night (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>Trucks and buses hit fewer people than cars, but when they hit, people die. In this district slice, trucks account for 24 pedestrian strikes and <strong>four pedestrian deaths</strong>; SUVs and cars account for 383 strikes and two deaths. The dataset is blunt about the body count (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle rollup</a>).</p><h3 id=what-the-numbers-say>What the numbers say</h3><p>From 2022 through August 24, 2025, this area saw 6,190 crashes, 2,873 injuries, and <strong>15 deaths</strong>. Pedestrians: six dead, 467 injured. Cyclists: three dead, 483 injured. People on mopeds and other small devices are in the ledger too. The worst hours hit when most people are on foot or bike, or when streets go dim (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district totals</a>).</p><p>The last 12 months: seven killed.

The bill says, “the department shall complete the installation… by no later than 60 days.” It sits in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>).</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, the DOT told lawmakers to wait years for a full redesign. Brooklyn’s borough president called the corridor “one of the most dangerous” and urged a road diet and the full safety toolkit. The agency offered paint and planters. Residents spoke about fear and blind turns (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>Streetsblog hearing coverage</a>).</p><h3 id=local-fixes-on-the-table>Local fixes on the table</h3><ul><li>Harden left turns at Union, Flushing, Morgan. Concrete, tight radii, and slower entries reduce turning kills. The deaths at Withers/Woodpoint and Scholes/Union were both left turns (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4796530</a>; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4808695</a>).</li><li>Daylight and protect crossings on <strong>Flushing Avenue</strong> and <strong>Morgan Avenue</strong>, named hotspots with recurring injuries and deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>).</li><li>Target heavy vehicles. The district’s pedestrian deaths skew to trucks. Enforce and route freight to spare people on foot and bike during peak injury hours (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle rollup</a>; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-moves-that-save-lives>Citywide moves that save lives</h3><ul><li>Lower speeds. A citywide 20 mph default is on the table. The Council and DOT already cite lower speed limits as life‑saving in new 20 mph slow zones. DOT’s own commissioner said, “Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.” That line backed Dumbo’s 20 mph rollout after Sammy’s Law passed (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/speed-limit-lowered-dumbo-slow-zone/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</li><li>Stop repeat speeders. State legislators pitched mandatory speed limiters for the worst offenders this year. Sponsors said the devices would keep cars from becoming “a deadly weapon,” and that “we have the tools and the knowledge to prevent these tragedies.” Families for Safe Streets backed the bill (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/brooklyn-crash-speed-limiters-reckless-drivers/>amNY</a>).</li></ul><p>This district’s map is a ledger of left turns, truck fronts, and bodies in crosswalks. The fixes are not secrets. They are waiting.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall to lower speeds and use the tools we already have. Act at our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action page</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They warn free bridges funnel traffic into certain neighborhoods. Their letter calls for fairness. The MTA stays silent. The Traffic Mobility Review Board will decide. Streets hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On July 18, 2023, Council Member Shahana Hanif and other Brooklyn officials called for 'equalized tolling on all crossings into Manhattan' as congestion pricing nears. Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Nydia Velázquez, and Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez urged state officials to join the city in seeking federal funding for the BQGreen park proposal. The plan would cap a stretch of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in south Williamsburg, creating 3.5 acres of new parkland. Reynoso called on Governor Kathy Hochul to act as a co-applicant for funds, stating, "We're calling on Gov. Kathy Hochul to be a co-applicant alongside the City of New York for federal funding to finally deck the BQE." Velázquez said, "We are fighting to reimagine the way to reconnect neighborhoods, improve traffic and reduce toxic pollution." Gutierrez stressed the urgent need for open space and clean air. The proposal, estimated at $100-200 million, is framed as an environmental justice effort to heal a community long divided and harmed by the highway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, managed by the Department of Transportation, will run on five Saturdays in July and August, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., covering 17 miles. Borough presidents Antonio Reynoso (Brooklyn) and Donovan Richards (Queens) pushed for this expansion, with Reynoso praising the use of major corridors like Eastern Parkway. Mayor Adams said, “This is a five-borough city and we are now saying the Summer Streets program is going be a five-borough initiative. Everyone deserves to enjoy that.” Adams expressed interest in longer hours but cited public safety and NYPD staffing costs as barriers. Advocates want more hours and connected car-free routes. The city will spend $1.5 million, not including staffing. The expansion marks a step forward, but the early end time leaves advocates wanting more.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Delays keep rogue haulers on the street. Reckless driving and deaths persist. Members pressed for urgency. DSNY offered shifting timelines. The city’s most vulnerable remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On February 23, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on the delayed rollout of commercial waste zone reform, first mandated by law in 2019. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) admitted the overhaul would not start until late 2024, with citywide coverage years away. The matter, described as a fix for a 'free-for-all system that led to reckless driving and fatalities,' remains stalled. Council Members Lincoln Restler and Julie Menin pressed DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch on the slow pace and shifting deadlines. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who introduced the original legislation, stressed the need for clear guidance. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure highlighted the deadly consequences of delay. DSNY opposes a bill from Council Member Sandy Nurse to create a working group to address these setbacks. The ongoing delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed to dangerous private carting trucks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'the front end crushed her arm. She stood in shock, blood rising through her sleeve, the engine still warm behind her.' The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors by the driver. The woman suffered crush injuries to her upper arm and shoulder. No helmet or signal use is mentioned as a factor.

The Department of Sanitation announced on February 22, 2023, that the citywide overhaul will not begin until late 2024, with a pilot program in one zone. The reform, first set under Mayor de Blasio, aims to fix inefficiency, worker mistreatment, environmental harm, and traffic carnage. The matter summary notes at least 43 deaths and 107 injuries from commercial garbage trucks in nine years. Councilmember Lincoln Restler called the timeline 'extremely slow' and said delays undermine the law's worker and environmental justice goals. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, sponsor of the 2019 bill, stressed that safety improvements for workers are essential and overdue. The pilot zone is still undetermined. Full implementation will roll out across 20 zones over two years, but for now, the danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Mayor Adams Has Leverage to Force a Reluctant State DOT to Budge on the BQE,' details how city DOT can veto regional transportation plans and must approve state highway projects within city limits. Jon Orcutt, former city DOT official, urges Adams to push for a full corridor plan and not settle for piecemeal fixes. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso are named as officials demanding state DOT return to the process. The BQE has long divided North Brooklyn, bringing pollution and danger to dense neighborhoods.

He calls for more protected bike lanes, a finished greenway, and streets built for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>On February 20, 2023, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso voiced strong support for Council Member Lincoln Restler’s Intro 417 and Intro 501. Intro 417 aims to 'change the approval process of bike lanes and major transportation projects in the community boards,' cutting delays. Intro 501 would fine drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants, with civilians able to report violations and receive a portion of the fine. Reynoso said, 'Those are two pieces I’d love to see pushed absolutely.' He also champions protected bike lanes, a comprehensive bike network, and the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway. Reynoso’s stance is clear: streets must be safer for people walking and biking. He wants action after recent traffic violence and supports more open streets. The plaza outside Borough Hall is now a park, closed to cars. Reynoso’s priorities put vulnerable road users first.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
