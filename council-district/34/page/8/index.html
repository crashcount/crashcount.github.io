Eleven suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a door that will never open again.</p><p>Just days ago, a man was struck and dragged more than 50 feet on Broadway in Bushwick. The driver fled. Police found the man dying in the street. They are still looking for the one who killed him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Police were looking for the driver of a car that struck and dragged a 47-year-old man on a Brooklyn street over the weekend, killing him.</a> The victim&rsquo;s name has not been released. The city has not said if he was in a crosswalk. It does not matter. He is dead. The driver is gone.</p><p>On Morgan Avenue, a box truck killed a pedestrian crossing near Sharon Street. No marked crosswalk. No protection. This is the third fatal crash on Morgan in three years. Juan Ignacio Serra, a local, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed.</a> The city has not acted. The avenue remains a gauntlet for anyone on foot or bike.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h2><p><strong>District 34 saw 1,725 crashes in the last 12 months.</strong> Seven dead. Eleven with life-altering injuries. The toll is rising. Last year, there were zero deaths in the same period. Now there are seven. Injuries are up by a third. Serious injuries up by almost half. The disaster is not sudden. It is slow, grinding, and relentless.</p><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. <strong>Two deaths and 375 injuries came from sedans and SUVs.</strong> Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. No one is safe. Not the young, not the old. Not the ones crossing with the light. Not the ones just trying to get home.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has co-sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, forcing the city to install daylighting barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. The bill sits in committee. The city waits. The dead do not. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>See the bill</a>.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it. The city can redesign streets. It has not moved fast enough. The city can protect the most vulnerable. It has not.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Gutiérrez. Demand the city clear every crosswalk, lower every speed limit, and build streets that do not kill. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood is already on the street. Make sure it stops here.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Nydia Velázquez, and Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez urged state officials to join the city in seeking federal funding for the BQGreen park proposal. The plan would cap a stretch of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in south Williamsburg, creating 3.5 acres of new parkland. Reynoso called on Governor Kathy Hochul to act as a co-applicant for funds, stating, "We're calling on Gov. Kathy Hochul to be a co-applicant alongside the City of New York for federal funding to finally deck the BQE." Velázquez said, "We are fighting to reimagine the way to reconnect neighborhoods, improve traffic and reduce toxic pollution." Gutierrez stressed the urgent need for open space and clean air. The proposal, estimated at $100-200 million, is framed as an environmental justice effort to heal a community long divided and harmed by the highway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, managed by the Department of Transportation, will run on five Saturdays in July and August, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., covering 17 miles. Borough presidents Antonio Reynoso (Brooklyn) and Donovan Richards (Queens) pushed for this expansion, with Reynoso praising the use of major corridors like Eastern Parkway. Mayor Adams said, “This is a five-borough city and we are now saying the Summer Streets program is going be a five-borough initiative. Everyone deserves to enjoy that.” Adams expressed interest in longer hours but cited public safety and NYPD staffing costs as barriers. Advocates want more hours and connected car-free routes. The city will spend $1.5 million, not including staffing.

At a rally, Restler said, "It is wrong how deadly this strip is." The officials demand mid-block crossings, daylighted intersections, raised crosswalks, curb extensions, and safer pedestrian space near BQE ramps. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized city resistance to reallocating street space, saying, "They drag their feet because they don’t want to do the inevitable." The Department of Transportation has agreed only to study new crosswalks. The bill is not yet formal legislation but marks a push for action after years of delay.

Hudson stated, 'We have to do all we can to ensure that our communities are responsive to the needs of our aging population.'

The matter, described as a fix for a 'free-for-all system that led to reckless driving and fatalities,' remains stalled.

Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who introduced the original legislation, stressed the need for clear guidance. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure highlighted the deadly consequences of delay. DSNY opposes a bill from Council Member Sandy Nurse to create a working group to address these setbacks.

Intro 501 would fine drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants, with civilians able to report violations and receive a portion of the fine. Reynoso said, 'Those are two pieces I’d love to see pushed absolutely.' He also champions protected bike lanes, a comprehensive bike network, and the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway. Reynoso’s stance is clear: streets must be safer for people walking and biking. He wants action after recent traffic violence and supports more open streets.

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint.
