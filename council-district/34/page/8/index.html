Eleven suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a door that will never open again.</p><p>Just days ago, a man was struck and dragged more than 50 feet on Broadway in Bushwick. The driver fled. Police found the man dying in the street. They are still looking for the one who killed him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Police were looking for the driver of a car that struck and dragged a 47-year-old man on a Brooklyn street over the weekend, killing him.</a> The victim&rsquo;s name has not been released. The city has not said if he was in a crosswalk. It does not matter. He is dead. The driver is gone.</p><p>On Morgan Avenue, a box truck killed a pedestrian crossing near Sharon Street. No marked crosswalk. No protection. This is the third fatal crash on Morgan in three years. Juan Ignacio Serra, a local, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed.</a> The city has not acted. The avenue remains a gauntlet for anyone on foot or bike.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h2><p><strong>District 34 saw 1,725 crashes in the last 12 months.</strong> Seven dead. Eleven with life-altering injuries. The toll is rising. Last year, there were zero deaths in the same period. Now there are seven. Injuries are up by a third. Serious injuries up by almost half. The disaster is not sudden. It is slow, grinding, and relentless.</p><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. <strong>Two deaths and 375 injuries came from sedans and SUVs.</strong> Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. No one is safe. Not the young, not the old. Not the ones crossing with the light. Not the ones just trying to get home.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has co-sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, forcing the city to install daylighting barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. The bill sits in committee. The city waits. The dead do not. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>See the bill</a>.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it. The city can redesign streets. It has not moved fast enough. The city can protect the most vulnerable. It has not.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Gutiérrez. Demand the city clear every crosswalk, lower every speed limit, and build streets that do not kill. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood is already on the street. Make sure it stops here.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The initiative, supported by Council Member Crystal Hudson, Chair of the City Council Committee on Aging, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, narrows 33 ideas to ten urgent actions. The report calls to 'ensure safe, clean, well-maintained sidewalks with well-lit intersections,' and to 'provide training to MTA bus drivers on working with older riders and riders with disabilities.' Hudson stated, 'We have to do all we can to ensure that our communities are responsive to the needs of our aging population.' The recommendations target housing, transportation, and public safety, aiming to reduce risks for older pedestrians and transit users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) admitted the overhaul would not start until late 2024, with citywide coverage years away. The matter, described as a fix for a 'free-for-all system that led to reckless driving and fatalities,' remains stalled. Council Members Lincoln Restler and Julie Menin pressed DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch on the slow pace and shifting deadlines. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who introduced the original legislation, stressed the need for clear guidance. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure highlighted the deadly consequences of delay. DSNY opposes a bill from Council Member Sandy Nurse to create a working group to address these setbacks. The ongoing delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed to dangerous private carting trucks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation announced on February 22, 2023, that the citywide overhaul will not begin until late 2024, with a pilot program in one zone. The reform, first set under Mayor de Blasio, aims to fix inefficiency, worker mistreatment, environmental harm, and traffic carnage. The matter summary notes at least 43 deaths and 107 injuries from commercial garbage trucks in nine years. Councilmember Lincoln Restler called the timeline 'extremely slow' and said delays undermine the law's worker and environmental justice goals. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, sponsor of the 2019 bill, stressed that safety improvements for workers are essential and overdue. The pilot zone is still undetermined.

The article, titled 'Mayor Adams Has Leverage to Force a Reluctant State DOT to Budge on the BQE,' details how city DOT can veto regional transportation plans and must approve state highway projects within city limits. Jon Orcutt, former city DOT official, urges Adams to push for a full corridor plan and not settle for piecemeal fixes. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso are named as officials demanding state DOT return to the process.

Intro 417 aims to 'change the approval process of bike lanes and major transportation projects in the community boards,' cutting delays. Intro 501 would fine drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants, with civilians able to report violations and receive a portion of the fine. Reynoso said, 'Those are two pieces I’d love to see pushed absolutely.' He also champions protected bike lanes, a comprehensive bike network, and the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway. Reynoso’s stance is clear: streets must be safer for people walking and biking. He wants action after recent traffic violence and supports more open streets. The plaza outside Borough Hall is now a park, closed to cars. Reynoso’s priorities put vulnerable road users first.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens.

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.

The measures, revived in committee, seek to redesign truck routes and gather data on facilities run by Amazon, FedEx, and UPS. The matter aims to 'reduce congestion and emissions, improve safety and increase visibility,' especially in overburdened neighborhoods like Red Hook and Sunset Park. Avilés, the lead sponsor, calls for systematic changes: 'We really need to look systematically at more improved routes to ensure people are safe.' The bills would require the Department of Transportation to daylight intersections and the Department of Environmental Protection to install air monitors on heavy-use roads. Councilwoman Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsors a related bill for public truck-route data. The legislation draws support from industry and advocates, all seeking safer streets and cleaner air for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
