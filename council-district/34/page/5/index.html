The 29-year-old motorcycle rider, who was wearing a helmet, was crushed and partially ejected from his bike. He died at the scene from severe injuries to his entire body. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, drawing attention to the failure of at least one driver to obey traffic signals or signs. Both vehicles were reported as going straight ahead at the time of impact. The truck's left front quarter panel was struck, and the motorcycle overturned. The report makes no mention of any victim error or behavior contributing to the crash. The violence of the impact and the disregard for traffic control proved fatal.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

DOT claims improvements, but critics remain unsatisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 20, 2024, the city announced it will proceed with a controversial redesign of McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The plan, not a council bill but a Department of Transportation decision, extends parking-protected bike lanes from Calyer Street to Meeker Avenue. Councilmember Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, criticized the move, saying, 'The mayor has put forward a compromise that nobody likes.' A coalition of elected officials—including Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso—called for a more thorough redesign, arguing the current plan preserves dangerous elements. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone claimed the redesign will make the corridor safer for all users, with new bike lanes and sidewalk extensions. Despite these claims, advocates and local leaders argue the plan fails to address core dangers and puts vulnerable road users at continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push.

Reynoso wants the city to set strict maximums on parking spaces in new developments, especially near transit. The matter summary states, 'Our recommendation is to remove as much parking as possible, but [if a] developer feels an obligation to put in a certain amount of parking, there should be a maximum allowable in transit-rich areas.' Reynoso supports eliminating parking mandates but says it is not enough. He points to developers building excess parking even near subways and calls for rules like Manhattan Core’s. Reynoso’s push aims to curb car dependency and promote safer, transit-oriented neighborhoods.

Council grilled DSNY for picking low bids over safety. Victims’ lives lost in the math. Oversight weak. Dangerous firms keep rolling. Streets stay risky for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 4, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on commercial waste zone implementation and contractor selection. The hearing spotlighted the Commercial Waste Zones law, which aims to cut crashes by limiting private trash haulers in each zone. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, author of the 2019 reform, and Council Member Shaun Abreu led the charge, questioning why companies like Cogent Waste Solutions—with poor safety records—were awarded contracts. Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial.

The report states the Vespa rider, age 31, was ejected from his motorcycle, his helmet split, and he suffered severe head bleeding but remained conscious at the scene. The crash occurred at 14:44. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the collision. Both vehicles were making right turns when the impact occurred, with the Vespa striking the right front quarter panel of the SUV. The SUV sustained no damage, while the Vespa was damaged at the center front end. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor, focusing instead on driver inattention as the primary cause.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The rule, not yet law, would require all contracted waste haulers to submit detailed crash and driving data twice a year. The matter targets companies like Action Carting, linked to at least five traffic deaths. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who led the original reforms as a council member, said, 'Crash data from [commercial waste zone] awardees is good, but crash data from CWZ applicants would have been even better.' The bill aims to end the 'Wild West' of private waste hauling, which killed seven New Yorkers in a single year. The new rules demand real-time telematics, immediate injury reports, and full transparency on crashes. Advocates say the data could help redesign streets and hold dangerous drivers to account.

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) will launch only one zone in central Queens after September 3, 2024. The oversight task force has not met in two years. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who authored the law as a Council member, called DSNY’s rollout a 'missed opportunity' for clarity and accountability. Justin Wood of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest warned, 'The system cannot achieve transformational change if it is treated as a limited pilot program.' The city’s goal to cut truck miles falls short of original promises. Action Carting, whose driver killed a cyclist in 2017, secured contracts for 14 zones.
