Eight hundred twenty-eight injured.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in District 34 in the last year alone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Crashes do not care about age. The dead include a 65-year-old, a 35-year-old, a 25-year-old. The wounded are children, elders, and everyone in between. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families left waiting for someone who will never come home.</p><p>Just days ago, a man was struck and killed crossing Broadway at Suydam Street. The driver did not stop. Police found the man dead in the road. The vehicle, maybe a garbage truck, kept going. Police are still looking for the driver. The victim’s name is not public yet. The silence is heavy. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian crossing a Brooklyn street, then left the scene, police said Sunday.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-bodies>Broken Promises, Broken Bodies</h3><p><strong>The violence is relentless.</strong> In the last twelve months, crashes have jumped nearly 20%. Injuries are up almost 29%. Serious injuries climbed 40%. The city’s answer? More studies. More waiting. The street stays the same. The blood dries. The next crash comes.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks and force the city to clear sightlines at a thousand intersections a year. The bill sits in committee, waiting (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see the bill</a>). The work is not done. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Gutiérrez. Demand a vote on the daylighting bill. Demand more than studies and promises. Demand action that saves lives, not just headlines. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT claims improvements, but critics remain unsatisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 20, 2024, the city announced it will proceed with a controversial redesign of McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The plan, not a council bill but a Department of Transportation decision, extends parking-protected bike lanes from Calyer Street to Meeker Avenue. Councilmember Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, criticized the move, saying, 'The mayor has put forward a compromise that nobody likes.' A coalition of elected officials—including Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso—called for a more thorough redesign, arguing the current plan preserves dangerous elements. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone claimed the redesign will make the corridor safer for all users, with new bike lanes and sidewalk extensions. Despite these claims, advocates and local leaders argue the plan fails to address core dangers and puts vulnerable road users at continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, led by NYC DOT, brings mid-block crossings, concrete pedestrian islands, curb enhancements, and split-phase signals to one of Brooklyn’s deadliest corridors. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push.

The matter summary states, 'Our recommendation is to remove as much parking as possible, but [if a] developer feels an obligation to put in a certain amount of parking, there should be a maximum allowable in transit-rich areas.' Reynoso supports eliminating parking mandates but says it is not enough. He points to developers building excess parking even near subways and calls for rules like Manhattan Core’s. Reynoso’s push aims to curb car dependency and promote safer, transit-oriented neighborhoods.

Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial.

Prime sponsor Joann Ariola, joined by sixteen co-sponsors, pushes for at least 25 step streets to be lit each year until all are covered.

The rule, not yet law, would require all contracted waste haulers to submit detailed crash and driving data twice a year. The matter targets companies like Action Carting, linked to at least five traffic deaths. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who led the original reforms as a council member, said, 'Crash data from [commercial waste zone] awardees is good, but crash data from CWZ applicants would have been even better.' The bill aims to end the 'Wild West' of private waste hauling, which killed seven New Yorkers in a single year. The new rules demand real-time telematics, immediate injury reports, and full transparency on crashes. Advocates say the data could help redesign streets and hold dangerous drivers to account. The city must prevent weak enforcement from gutting the law’s promise.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) will launch only one zone in central Queens after September 3, 2024. The oversight task force has not met in two years. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who authored the law as a Council member, called DSNY’s rollout a 'missed opportunity' for clarity and accountability. Justin Wood of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest warned, 'The system cannot achieve transformational change if it is treated as a limited pilot program.' The city’s goal to cut truck miles falls short of original promises. Action Carting, whose driver killed a cyclist in 2017, secured contracts for 14 zones.
