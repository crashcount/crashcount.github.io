Same ending.</p><ul><li>A 46‑year‑old pedestrian was killed by a southbound box truck at Maspeth and Morgan. The record shows &ldquo;crush injuries&rdquo; and “apparent death.” It happened at 7:58 a.m. on August 6. The truck kept going straight. The man was not in a crosswalk. The truck’s impact point was the right rear quarter of the box. That is all the city dataset gives us (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4833207</a>).</li><li>Five months earlier, a dump truck turned left and killed a pedestrian in a crosswalk at Woodpoint and Withers. The database calls the injury “crush” and the action “crossing with signal.” The truck&rsquo;s right front bumper hit. The victim died there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4796530</a>).</li><li>In March, another left turn at Union and Scholes ended a 72‑year‑old man’s life. The vehicle was making a left. The undercarriage shows the strike point (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4808695</a>).</li></ul><p>Heavy vehicles. Turning movements. People on foot. The same script.</p><h3 id=three-corners-one-fix>Three corners. One fix.</h3><p>The district’s worst pain shows up on a few names you know. <strong>Morgan Avenue</strong>. <strong>Flushing Avenue</strong>. <strong>Union Avenue</strong>. Morgan is tied to three deaths and 47 injuries. Flushing shows 88 injuries tied to one death. Union has two deaths and 13 injuries. These are the city’s own tallies for this map slice (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>).</p><p>The harm peaks in the dark and at the edges of the day. Deaths cluster at 3 a.m., 7 a.m., 8 a.m., 9 a.m., and 7 p.m. Injuries swell from mid‑afternoon through the evening rush and into night (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>Trucks and buses hit fewer people than cars, but when they hit, people die. In this district slice, trucks account for 24 pedestrian strikes and <strong>four pedestrian deaths</strong>; SUVs and cars account for 383 strikes and two deaths. The dataset is blunt about the body count (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle rollup</a>).</p><h3 id=what-the-numbers-say>What the numbers say</h3><p>From 2022 through August 24, 2025, this area saw 6,190 crashes, 2,873 injuries, and <strong>15 deaths</strong>. Pedestrians: six dead, 467 injured. Cyclists: three dead, 483 injured. People on mopeds and other small devices are in the ledger too. The worst hours hit when most people are on foot or bike, or when streets go dim (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district totals</a>).</p><p>The last 12 months: seven killed.

The bill says, “the department shall complete the installation… by no later than 60 days.” It sits in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>).</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, the DOT told lawmakers to wait years for a full redesign. Brooklyn’s borough president called the corridor “one of the most dangerous” and urged a road diet and the full safety toolkit. The agency offered paint and planters. Residents spoke about fear and blind turns (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>Streetsblog hearing coverage</a>).</p><h3 id=local-fixes-on-the-table>Local fixes on the table</h3><ul><li>Harden left turns at Union, Flushing, Morgan. Concrete, tight radii, and slower entries reduce turning kills. The deaths at Withers/Woodpoint and Scholes/Union were both left turns (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4796530</a>; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4808695</a>).</li><li>Daylight and protect crossings on <strong>Flushing Avenue</strong> and <strong>Morgan Avenue</strong>, named hotspots with recurring injuries and deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>).</li><li>Target heavy vehicles. The district’s pedestrian deaths skew to trucks.

A citywide 20 mph default is on the table. The Council and DOT already cite lower speed limits as life‑saving in new 20 mph slow zones. DOT’s own commissioner said, “Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.” That line backed Dumbo’s 20 mph rollout after Sammy’s Law passed (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/speed-limit-lowered-dumbo-slow-zone/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</li><li>Stop repeat speeders. State legislators pitched mandatory speed limiters for the worst offenders this year. Sponsors said the devices would keep cars from becoming “a deadly weapon,” and that “we have the tools and the knowledge to prevent these tragedies.” Families for Safe Streets backed the bill (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/brooklyn-crash-speed-limiters-reckless-drivers/>amNY</a>).</li></ul><p>This district’s map is a ledger of left turns, truck fronts, and bodies in crosswalks. The fixes are not secrets. They are waiting.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall to lower speeds and use the tools we already have.

We wouldn't allow for what I consider his false narrative and public perception to dictate safety and safety policy."" -- Antonio Reynoso</p><p class=mb3>On January 21, 2025, the City Council, under Speaker Adrienne Adams, set its transportation agenda. The session saw progressives sidelined as the Council prioritized car-centric bills, including Intros 103 and 104 (parking protection) and hearings on Intro 606 (e-bike registration). The Common Sense Caucus, known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, led the charge. Progressive members lost key committee seats. Universal daylighting (Intro 1138) and other safety reforms stalled. Council Member Julie Won continued to push for daylighting but faced resistance. As Streetsblog reported, 'roadway safety is simply not a priority.' Advocates and former members criticized the Council for failing to hold the mayor accountable on the Streets Master Plan and for focusing on parking over safety. The Council's actions marked a retreat from previous street safety gains, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say it slows life-saving street redesigns. Advocates warn it props up car culture and blocks safer bike lanes. The bill risks more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 103, now before the City Council, would require the Department of Transportation to notify Council members every time a single parking spot is repurposed—for car-share, bike corrals, or Citi Bike docks. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Parks Committee and full board both voted unanimously for the $30 million overhaul, which includes $20.97 million for the Shore Road Promenade and $9.25 million for Leif Ericson Park. The project, described as 'Destination: Greenways!', will expand green space, separate bike and pedestrian lanes, add lighting, and install new amenities. Brannan, a key funder and supporter, said, 'Our local parks are the lungs of our city.' The overhaul aims to improve recreational cycling, repair pothole-ridden paths, and increase accessibility. Board members raised concerns about safety and sanitation, which the Parks Department pledged to address in final designs.

The matter summary states: 'ending mandatory parking in areas with the best transit while keeping the costly mandate in low-density neighborhoods where it most hinders development.' Council Member Crystal Hudson voted yes, urging all neighborhoods to share the housing burden. Council Member Kevin Riley defended single-family zones. Council Member Rafael Salamanca cited balancing concerns and securing $5 billion for affordable housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso warned of increased housing pressure elsewhere.
