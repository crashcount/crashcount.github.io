A dump truck turns. He is dead before sunrise. The driver leaves. No arrest. No answers. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Police said the driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene. No arrests have been announced.</a></p><p>In the last year, <strong>four people died</strong> on District 34 streets. <strong>Nine more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 700 were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. Pedestrians, cyclists, children. Trucks and SUVs crush, sedans strike, bikes collide. The city counts the bodies. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=leadership-bills-votes-and-the-slow-march>Leadership: Bills, Votes, and the Slow March</h2><p>Council Member <strong>Jennifer Gutiérrez</strong> has signed her name to safety. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushed for protected bike lanes, and backed the bill to ban parking near crosswalks—daylighting corners so drivers can see children before it is too late. She voted to end jaywalking tickets, shifting blame off the dead and onto the street itself. She stood with neighbors for a 20 mph speed limit in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, after years of carnage. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><p>When the city closed a deadly Bushwick intersection, Gutiérrez supported the redesign. The plan bans cars from a crash hotspot, removes parking at corners, and builds concrete for feet, not wheels. DOT says it could cut deaths by up to 45% for pedestrians. But the street was only fixed after a man died. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/28/city-to-fix-dangerous-bushwick-intersection-where-driver-killed-motorcyclist>The intersection, described as a &lsquo;crash hotspot&rsquo; with 39 incidents since 2020, will see expanded pedestrian space and improved safety.</a></p><h2 id=the-next-fight-speed-cameras-and-relentless-pressure>The Next Fight: Speed, Cameras, and Relentless Pressure</h2><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> The city has the power to lower limits. It has the tools—speed cameras, daylighted corners, protected lanes. What it lacks is urgency. Every day of delay is another family broken. The numbers are not fate. They are choices.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand 20 mph limits. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets for people, not trucks.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter aims to 'reduce congestion and emissions, improve safety and increase visibility,' especially in overburdened neighborhoods like Red Hook and Sunset Park. Avilés, the lead sponsor, calls for systematic changes: 'We really need to look systematically at more improved routes to ensure people are safe.' The bills would require the Department of Transportation to daylight intersections and the Department of Environmental Protection to install air monitors on heavy-use roads. Councilwoman Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsors a related bill for public truck-route data.

It would have required DOT to audit the city’s deadliest intersections and consider installing leading pedestrian intervals and exclusive pedestrian phases—signals proven to protect people on foot. The bill’s failure leaves dangerous crossings unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislation, discussed in the City Council, exempts NYPD, news, and hospital helicopters. The bill’s matter title: 'Stop the Chop.' Council Members Amanda Farias, Gale Brewer, Shahana Hanif, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Christopher Marte, and Carlina Rivera joined as sponsors. Hanif stated, 'Our airspace is not for sale to the highest bidder and should only be available to essential needs of our city.' The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution. The proposal aims to cut thousands of flights, reduce greenhouse gases, and restore peace to city parks and neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'City lawmakers and transportation and education advocates expressed outrage over a recent Streetsblog report on dangerous school streets, demanding the city do more to prevent drivers from harming children outside schools.' Lawmakers called the findings 'egregious' and 'unconscionable.' They urged more crossing guards, traffic calming, and car-free hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez signaled openness to restricting cars during key times. The council’s stance is clear: the city’s inaction puts children, especially those of color, at deadly risk.
