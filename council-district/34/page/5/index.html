Ten left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, 708 hurt, 1,435 crashes—each one a story that ends in pain or silence. The dead do not speak. The living limp, or grieve, or wait for justice that never comes.</p><p>A man kneels to pick up food on Withers Street. A dump truck turns. He is gone. The driver leaves.

The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-votes-and-the-slow-grind-of-change>Leadership: Promises, Votes, and the Slow Grind of Change</h3><p>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has signed her name to bills that promise safer streets. She backed the SAFE Streets Act, the push for 20 mph speed limits, and the ban on parking near crosswalks. She voted to legalize crossing mid-block, ending the old blame game against walkers. She stood with neighbors for a safer McGuinness Boulevard. She called for daylight at corners where drivers once hid behind parked cars.</p><p>But the blood keeps running. <strong>Bills sit in committee. Promises wait for a vote.</strong> The city talks of redesigns, but corners stay blind, and trucks still turn wide. The law moves slow. The street moves fast.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can daylight every corner. It can build real protection for people on foot and bike. It can act, or it can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait for you.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, led by NYC DOT, brings mid-block crossings, concrete pedestrian islands, curb enhancements, and split-phase signals to one of Brooklyn’s deadliest corridors. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push.

The matter summary states, 'Our recommendation is to remove as much parking as possible, but [if a] developer feels an obligation to put in a certain amount of parking, there should be a maximum allowable in transit-rich areas.' Reynoso supports eliminating parking mandates but says it is not enough. He points to developers building excess parking even near subways and calls for rules like Manhattan Core’s. Reynoso’s push aims to curb car dependency and promote safer, transit-oriented neighborhoods.

Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, author of the 2019 reform, and Council Member Shaun Abreu led the charge, questioning why companies like Cogent Waste Solutions—with poor safety records—were awarded contracts. Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial.

The bill states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code... in relation to vehicles reported as abandoned to the department of sanitation.' Sponsored by Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (primary) and co-sponsored by over a dozen council members, it forces the Department of Sanitation to remove derelict vehicles within 72 hours and empowers NYPD to tow cars with missing or obscured plates or stickers. The law aims to clear street hazards fast, reducing risks for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Only one Queens zone launches this fall. Nineteen more wait in limbo. Oversight is absent. Haulers with deadly records win contracts. Advocates demand speed, transparency, and real safety for streets choked by trucks.</p><p class=mb3>Council Bill for commercial waste zone reform, passed in 2019, remains stalled. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) will launch only one zone in central Queens after September 3, 2024. The oversight task force has not met in two years. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who authored the law as a Council member, called DSNY’s rollout a 'missed opportunity' for clarity and accountability. Justin Wood of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest warned, 'The system cannot achieve transformational change if it is treated as a limited pilot program.' The city’s goal to cut truck miles falls short of original promises. Action Carting, whose driver killed a cyclist in 2017, secured contracts for 14 zones. Advocates say the lack of outreach, oversight, and clear safety benchmarks leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 8:20 a.m. The report states the cyclist 'struck a parked Jeep,' was 'ejected,' and 'landed hard.' The narrative describes 'blood pooled,' 'his head split open,' and the cyclist remained 'conscious' with 'severe lacerations.' The Jeep’s 'doors bore the dent,' and the 'bike’s front crumpled.' The police report lists 'Other Vehicular' as a contributing factor, but does not specify any cyclist behavior as a cause. No helmet use or cyclist error is cited as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the collision’s violent impact and the systemic danger posed by parked vehicles in the cyclist’s path.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
