These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement and families left with empty chairs. In the last twelve months alone, six more people died. Twelve were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same again.</p><p>Just this spring, a 42-year-old man was killed crossing Withers Street with the signal. A dump truck turned left and crushed him (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). He was doing everything right. The truck kept going. The city kept moving.</p><h3 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—<strong>369 incidents</strong>. Trucks and buses follow, with <strong>40 more</strong>. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the real danger comes on four wheels or more (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The pattern is old. The pain is fresh. A cyclist was struck by a turning driver on McGuinness Boulevard just days ago. The bike lane was only paint. The city had promised more. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p><strong>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks</strong>—a move to daylight intersections and save lives (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). The bill would force the city to clear at least 1,000 crosswalks a year. It sits in committee. The city waits. The dead do not.</p><p><strong>The work is not done.</strong> Every delay is another risk. Every watered-down promise is another family shattered. The city can move faster. The council can demand more. The mayor can act. But only if you make them.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong> Call Council Member Gutiérrez. Demand the passage and funding of the daylighting bill. Demand protected bike lanes, not just paint. Demand a city where crossing the street is not a gamble with your life.</p><p><strong>If you do nothing, nothing will change.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Reynoso insists the new corridor must be at least as long as Manhattan’s six-and-a-half-mile stretch, not just a patchwork of short Open Streets. He told Streetsblog, "We have to think about, long-term, having a route that is as long if not longer than the one Manhattan does." Reynoso commits city funding to make this happen. The Adams administration has yet to announce plans. The matter, described as 'expansion of car-free Summer Streets program to Brooklyn,' remains in policy advocacy, with support from public-space advocates. Reynoso’s push centers on opening streets to pedestrians and cyclists, not just for events, but as a lasting, borough-wide change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, who once supported the law as a council member, now claims a protected lane would worsen traffic and turning conflicts. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Alexa Aviles criticized the decision, with Reynoso stating, 'protected bike lanes are essential,' and Aviles urging the city to 'install an alternative, fully protected bike lane where the road can accommodate one.' Advocates argue the shared lane is unsafe and often blocked by cars. The DOT’s move prioritizes vehicle flow over cyclist safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter aims to 'reduce congestion and emissions, improve safety and increase visibility,' especially in overburdened neighborhoods like Red Hook and Sunset Park. Avilés, the lead sponsor, calls for systematic changes: 'We really need to look systematically at more improved routes to ensure people are safe.' The bills would require the Department of Transportation to daylight intersections and the Department of Environmental Protection to install air monitors on heavy-use roads. Councilwoman Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsors a related bill for public truck-route data. The legislation draws support from industry and advocates, all seeking safer streets and cleaner air for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event came as the public comment period for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Central Business District Tolling Program ended. The plan would toll drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street, aiming to cut traffic and pollution. Restler said, “This is a tangible, major, sweeping policy that will dramatically reduce the number of cars and trucks on the street in New York City.” He supported limited exemptions, especially for taxis and for-hire vehicles, but stressed the need to keep cars off the road. The rally urged the Federal Highway Administration to approve the plan, which is expected to shift commuters to mass transit and modernize city infrastructure.

The matter, titled 'Adams Administration’s McGuinness Redesign Options Underwhelm Street Safety Boosters,' outlined three options: only one would remove travel lanes and add protected bike lanes. Council Member Lincoln Restler, joined by Assembly Member Emily Gallagher and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, criticized DOT’s proposals as 'inadequate.' Restler stated, 'The way we're going to fully connect Greenpoint community and make this street safer is by having less lanes of traffic.' Advocates and residents backed lane reductions and protected bike lanes, citing three deaths since 2014. DOT cited traffic concerns and delayed action. The hearing exposed a rift between community safety demands and DOT’s reluctance to prioritize vulnerable road users over car throughput and parking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
