Ten left with wounds that will not heal. In the last year, District 24 saw 1,344 crashes. Nine hundred and three people were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. A man, 56, struck by an SUV on Hillside Avenue. He did not get up again. A 21-year-old ejected from a moped, dead on 184th Street. A pedestrian crushed on the Van Wyck. These are not accidents. They are the price of inaction. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs took five lives and left 131 with injuries. Trucks, buses, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of death is on four wheels.</p><h3 id=gennaro-action-and-evasion>Gennaro: Action and Evasion</h3><p>Council Member James F. Gennaro has voted for some measures that help. He backed the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>citywide greenway plan</a>, a step toward safer routes for those not in cars. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law used to blame the dead. He co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>solar crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>curb repairs</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>school safety signs</a>. These are steps, but they are slow.</p><p>But Gennaro has also backed bills that shift blame to the vulnerable. He pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>higher fines on sidewalk riding</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>e-bike registration</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>studies of e-bike speed bumps</a>. He joined calls to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>ban e-scooter share</a> despite no deaths, no serious injuries, and 290,000 safe rides. Each new penalty on cyclists and scooter riders is a shield for drivers, not a guard for the vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The blood on the street is not washed away by studies or signs.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people walking and biking. End the delays. Call Gennaro. Call the mayor. Demand action that saves lives, not headlines. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
