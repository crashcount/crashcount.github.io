Same ending.</p><ul><li>Since 2022, District 24 has logged <strong>13 deaths</strong> and <strong>3,126 injuries</strong> across <strong>5,108 crashes</strong>. Pedestrians took 466 injuries and five deaths; cyclists one death and 111 injuries. Most harm lands on people outside the car. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</li><li>The toll peaks at the rush to and from work. Deaths spike around 8 a.m., 11 a.m., 3–6 p.m., and again at 9–10 p.m. Injuries stack up through the day. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</li></ul><p>Wrong-way on a highway. Five cars hit.</p><ul><li>On the Clearview, Joseph Lee drove into oncoming traffic and struck five vehicles. A jury convicted him. He got eight years. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers,” said DA Melinda Katz. Lee told police he went the wrong way “because I wanted to hurt people.” <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</li></ul><p>The corners that don’t forgive.</p><ul><li>The <strong>Grand Central Parkway</strong> and <strong>Van Wyck</strong> are steady producers of pain. So is the <strong>Long Island Expressway</strong>. These three corridors account for the district’s worst clusters. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Grand Central Pkwy</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Van Wyck Expwy</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Long Island Expressway</a>.</li><li>Heavy vehicles are part of the mix that hurts people on foot. Sedans and SUVs cause most pedestrian injuries, but trucks and buses still hit hard. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</li></ul><p>A body on 164th Street. A bike in pieces.</p><ul><li>A person on an e‑bike died after impacts with two SUVs on 164th Street in 2023. The data lists a death. That is the fact. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</li><li>A 21‑year‑old was killed at 73rd Avenue and 184th Street in 2024 in a crash involving a moped and an SUV. The record shows ejection and head trauma. No other detail is needed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4750201</a>.</li></ul><p>What breaks people here.</p><ul><li>The dataset flags “other” as the lead cause in this district’s harm: <strong>6 deaths</strong>, 812 injuries. Vulnerable road user “error” is blamed in records for <strong>2 deaths</strong> and 56 injuries. Inattention. Failure to yield. Red lights blown. Alcohol. These are in the ledger. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data factors</a>.</li><li>Pedestrians are struck most by sedans and SUVs: 217 and 161 cases, respectively, with five deaths between them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Open Data pedestrian causes</a>.</li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>On the service roads by the highways, crossings are long and fast. Daylight every corner. Add hardened turns. Give leading pedestrian intervals where people actually cross: along Union Turnpike, 164th Street, and Hillside. The district’s top hotspots are the <strong>Grand Central Parkway</strong> and the <strong>Van Wyck</strong>; slow the merge lanes and fence off shortcuts. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Top intersections</a>.</li><li>Nights and early mornings still hurt. Target those hours with speed control and visibility fixes. The midnight hour alone holds two deaths and 136 injuries in the period. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly distribution</a>.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>Albany gave the city power to drop speeds. The city can set safer limits. Do it. Our own reporting lays out the path and the call list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>The worst repeat offenders are known. One and a half percent of drivers cause a fifth of pedestrian deaths, advocates say. Mandate speed‑limiters for the ticket‑rich cars. Push the Stop Super Speeders Act. The how is here. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li></ul><p>Another day. Another family answering a phone that changes everything. The tools to slow the cars exist. Use them.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT says the program is safe and popular.</p><p class=mb3>On September 17, 2024, Council Member Sandra Ung announced a bill to ban the Queens e-scooter share program. The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'Council Bill Could Chill Citizen Reporting That Dramatically Boosted Idling Enforcement,' would give the city broad power to disqualify public participants from reporting idling, reduce fines for vehicles with anti-idling tech, and halve citizen bounties. It also allows school buses to idle up to 15 minutes and imposes a new code of conduct for enforcers. The Adams administration supports capping bounties but wants higher fines. Opponents, including the New York Clean Air Collective, say the bill 'weaponizes rules that chill participation' and will 'watch while companies like Con Ed, Verizon, and Amazon steal New York’s breath.' The Council is preparing for a hearing as debate intensifies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
