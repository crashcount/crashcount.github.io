The crash occurred at 11:35 a.m. The report states the SUV driver was 'distracted' and that 'alcohol was involved.' The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'other actions in roadway,' but the police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The SUV's right front bumper delivered the fatal blow, crushing the man's body. The police narrative describes the victim's death as immediate, with his body 'crumpled beneath the wheels.' No contributing factors are attributed to the pedestrian.

No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities.

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'Council Bill Could Chill Citizen Reporting That Dramatically Boosted Idling Enforcement,' would give the city broad power to disqualify public participants from reporting idling, reduce fines for vehicles with anti-idling tech, and halve citizen bounties. It also allows school buses to idle up to 15 minutes and imposes a new code of conduct for enforcers. The Adams administration supports capping bounties but wants higher fines. Opponents, including the New York Clean Air Collective, say the bill 'weaponizes rules that chill participation' and will 'watch while companies like Con Ed, Verizon, and Amazon steal New York’s breath.'
