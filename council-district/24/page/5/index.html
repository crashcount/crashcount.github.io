He died at the scene, police records show (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4729342</a>).</p><p><strong>Seventeen dead since 2022</strong></p><p>Since Jan 1, 2022, <strong>17 people have been killed</strong> and <strong>3,890 injured</strong> in Council District 24 crashes, including 5 people walking and 1 person on a bike (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Expressways cut through the map and the bodies follow: the Grand Central Parkway, the Van Wyck, the Long Island Expressway lead the district in deaths and injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The midnight hour hurts. District data show 4 deaths around 12 AM, with more fatalities scattered at 5 AM, 8–11 AM, late afternoon, and night. People walking and riding bleed most when drivers fail to yield or look, according to police-coded factors in local crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>“This is one of the most powerful advocacy forces I’ve ever seen in politics,” former DOT chief Polly Trottenberg said of Families for Safe Streets (<a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org/>Families for Safe Streets</a>). The road keeps proving her right.</p><p><strong>Where it keeps happening</strong></p><p>Grand Central Parkway is a hotspot, with repeated deaths and hundreds of injuries tied to crashes logged there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Van Wyck Expressway and the Long Island Expressway show the same pattern. Off the highways, <strong>164 Street</strong> and <strong>Hillside Avenue</strong> keep showing up in the injury rolls (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>One case is enough to understand the stakes. The man on Hillside never made it home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4729342</a>).</p><p><strong>Simple fixes, overdue</strong></p><p>The map suggests plain moves:</p><ul><li>Daylight intersections on Hillside and 164 Street. Clear sightlines save people crossing.</li><li>Harden left turns and add leading pedestrian intervals where the walking volume is high.</li><li>Target the night hours around the expressways. Slow entries and exits; keep speeding in check.</li></ul><p>These are basic tools. They match the harms we see here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>Who’s responsible for progress</strong></p><p>This is Council District 24, represented by James F. Gennaro. On city legislation, he co-sponsored the law requiring DOT to <strong>track progress on the Streets Master Plan</strong> (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1105-2024</a>) and supported a law to <strong>install pavement markings quickly after resurfacing</strong> (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1160-2025</a>). Both moves help turn plans into paint and keep projects honest.</p><p>But the killing doesn’t pause. Citywide, speed is the deadliest force on our streets. Cameras work; as one official record put it, “speed cameras have cut speeding by over 60%” where installed (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/senate-protects-new-york-students-and-pedestrians>NYS Senate</a>). The tools exist. Use them.</p><p><strong>What must happen next</strong></p><ul><li>Lower speeds where people live and cross. Do it across the map.</li><li>Stop repeat speeders with mandatory limiters. Take away the chance to race.</li></ul><p>These are the steps that match the bodies we count here. The man on Hillside. The five people walking who never came home. The one rider who didn’t get back on his bike (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>One call can help move it.
