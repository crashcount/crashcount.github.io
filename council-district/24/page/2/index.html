Ten left with wounds that will not heal. In the last year, District 24 saw 1,344 crashes. Nine hundred and three people were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. A man, 56, struck by an SUV on Hillside Avenue. He did not get up again. A 21-year-old ejected from a moped, dead on 184th Street. A pedestrian crushed on the Van Wyck. These are not accidents. They are the price of inaction. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs took five lives and left 131 with injuries.

Gennaro has voted for some measures that help. He backed the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>citywide greenway plan</a>, a step toward safer routes for those not in cars. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law used to blame the dead. He co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>solar crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>curb repairs</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>school safety signs</a>. These are steps, but they are slow.</p><p>But Gennaro has also backed bills that shift blame to the vulnerable. He pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>higher fines on sidewalk riding</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>e-bike registration</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>studies of e-bike speed bumps</a>. He joined calls to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>ban e-scooter share</a> despite no deaths, no serious injuries, and 290,000 safe rides. Each new penalty on cyclists and scooter riders is a shield for drivers, not a guard for the vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The blood on the street is not washed away by studies or signs.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people walking and biking. End the delays. Call Gennaro. Call the mayor. Demand action that saves lives, not headlines. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The right front bumper hit his head. Blood pooled on the dark asphalt. The child lay semiconscious, not yet one year old. The road offered no protection. The car did not stop.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a sedan traveling north near 75-11 150th Street in Queens struck an infant boy who was not yet one year old. The vehicle's right front bumper hit the child's head, causing severe bleeding and leaving him semiconscious on the roadway. The report states the crash occurred at 21:38, after dark. Driver inattention and distraction are cited as the sole contributing factors in both the vehicle and person records. The narrative confirms the driver was distracted at the time of impact. No contributing factors are attributed to the infant pedestrian. The police report describes the scene in stark terms: 'The right front bumper hit his head. He bled on the asphalt, semiconscious.'
