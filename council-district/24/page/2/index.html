One life.</p><p>A 21‑year‑old passenger died at 73rd Avenue and 184th Street. Police recorded him as ejected from a moped and “unconscious.” He did not get up. The SUV kept its course. That was <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>August 23, 2024</a> (CrashID 4750201).</p><p>On the Van Wyck, a 41‑year‑old man was struck and killed. The police report lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction” and “Alcohol Involvement.” He was recorded as having “Crush Injuries.” That was <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>December 3, 2024</a> (CrashID 4776236).</p><p>A 63‑year‑old driver died before dawn at 90th Avenue and 143rd Street. Another crash took a 24‑year‑old motorcyclist on the Long Island Expressway in daylight. Both fatalities sit in the city’s ledger as lines and codes. They are still there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash records</a> mark the dates: January 21, 2025 (4787451) and July 24, 2025 (4830329).</p><p>District 24 has paid a steady price. Since 2022: <strong>13 people dead</strong>, <strong>3,131 injured</strong>, <strong>32 seriously hurt</strong>. Pedestrians account for 5 deaths and 467 injuries. Cyclists: 1 death and 111 injuries. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage, tied to 444 pedestrian harms. These are the numbers the city keeps for this district, through <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>August 26, 2025</a>.</p><h3 id=highways-cut-through-bodies-follow>Highways cut through.

The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Long Island Expressway</a> shows 4 deaths and 300 injuries. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Van Wyck Expressway</a> shows 2 deaths and 317 injuries. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Grand Central Parkway</a> shows 1 death and 518 injuries.</p><p>Nights are not safe. Neither are mornings. The city’s clock tracks pain at every hour. Deaths spike at 5 a.m., 8 a.m., 11 a.m., 3 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m. Injuries stack through the afternoon, heaviest at 3 p.m. and 2 p.m. The curve does not rest. It only shifts. This is the district’s rhythm, logged by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYPD crash data</a>.</p><p>The culprits on paper are plain: “Other” factors lead the harm count, followed by “Vulnerable road user error,” then distraction and failure to yield. Pedestrians most often meet sedans and SUVs. Trucks and buses are fewer but heavy. This is the roll‑up in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>.</p><h3 id=quotes-the-city-cannot-take-back>Quotes the city cannot take back</h3><p>“Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway and crashed into multiple cars,” said Queens DA Melinda Katz. Two motorists were badly hurt. Lee told police he went the wrong way “because I wanted to hurt people and I felt ‘liberated’ by what I had done.” That was the <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>Clearview Expressway case</a> from a January 18, 2023 rampage, ending with an eight‑year sentence on August 14, 2025.</p><p>“A hit‑and‑run driver killed a 52‑year‑old man… The driver sped off without stopping.” That was 155th Street at South Conduit Avenue near JFK, 2:30 a.m., August 13, 2025. No arrests. Reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>Daily News</a> and <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>, both citing police.

Two men killed at the cart, the 84‑year‑old driver also dead. Police sources told reporters the driver had a stroke two weeks prior. The street ended in wreckage.

Start with speed and sightlines. Daylight corners. Harden the turns. Protect the crossings. Post and hold a lower limit on local streets. Target the hours when bodies fall most.</li><li>Who is getting hit: people on foot and on bikes. Build for them. Give leading pedestrian intervals. Build refuges. Separate the lanes where the turning steel meets the crosswalk.</li><li>What to remove: dead cars. The Council just passed a law to clear derelict vehicles fast. Council Member James Gennaro voted yes. The bill orders the city to tow hazards within 72 hours. That was <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857‑2024</a>, passed June 30, 2025.</li></ul><p>Queens politics circles scooters. One Council Member called the share program “chaos,” but the city’s numbers showed 290,000 trips and no reported serious injuries or deaths in its early months.
