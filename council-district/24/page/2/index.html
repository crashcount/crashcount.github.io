A man, 56, struck by an SUV on Hillside Avenue. He did not get up again. A 21-year-old ejected from a moped, dead on 184th Street. A pedestrian crushed on the Van Wyck. These are not accidents.

Gennaro has voted for some measures that help. He backed the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>citywide greenway plan</a>, a step toward safer routes for those not in cars. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law used to blame the dead. He co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>solar crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>curb repairs</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>school safety signs</a>. These are steps, but they are slow.</p><p>But Gennaro has also backed bills that shift blame to the vulnerable. He pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>higher fines on sidewalk riding</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>e-bike registration</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>studies of e-bike speed bumps</a>.

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'Council Bill Could Chill Citizen Reporting That Dramatically Boosted Idling Enforcement,' would give the city broad power to disqualify public participants from reporting idling, reduce fines for vehicles with anti-idling tech, and halve citizen bounties. It also allows school buses to idle up to 15 minutes and imposes a new code of conduct for enforcers. The Adams administration supports capping bounties but wants higher fines. Opponents, including the New York Clean Air Collective, say the bill 'weaponizes rules that chill participation' and will 'watch while companies like Con Ed, Verizon, and Amazon steal New York’s breath.'
