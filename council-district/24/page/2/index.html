Ten left with wounds that will not heal. In the last year, District 24 saw 1,344 crashes. Nine hundred and three people were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. A man, 56, struck by an SUV on Hillside Avenue. He did not get up again. A 21-year-old ejected from a moped, dead on 184th Street. A pedestrian crushed on the Van Wyck. These are not accidents. They are the price of inaction. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs took five lives and left 131 with injuries. Trucks, buses, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of death is on four wheels.</p><h3 id=gennaro-action-and-evasion>Gennaro: Action and Evasion</h3><p>Council Member James F. Gennaro has voted for some measures that help. He backed the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>citywide greenway plan</a>, a step toward safer routes for those not in cars. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law used to blame the dead. He co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>solar crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>curb repairs</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>school safety signs</a>. These are steps, but they are slow.</p><p>But Gennaro has also backed bills that shift blame to the vulnerable. He pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>higher fines on sidewalk riding</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>e-bike registration</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>studies of e-bike speed bumps</a>. He joined calls to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>ban e-scooter share</a> despite no deaths, no serious injuries, and 290,000 safe rides. Each new penalty on cyclists and scooter riders is a shield for drivers, not a guard for the vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The blood on the street is not washed away by studies or signs.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people walking and biking. End the delays. Call Gennaro. Call the mayor. Demand action that saves lives, not headlines. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash occurred at 11:35 a.m. The report states the SUV driver was 'distracted' and that 'alcohol was involved.'

The SUV's right front bumper delivered the fatal blow, crushing the man's body. The police narrative describes the victim's death as immediate, with his body 'crumpled beneath the wheels.' No contributing factors are attributed to the pedestrian.

It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'Council Bill Could Chill Citizen Reporting That Dramatically Boosted Idling Enforcement,' would give the city broad power to disqualify public participants from reporting idling, reduce fines for vehicles with anti-idling tech, and halve citizen bounties. It also allows school buses to idle up to 15 minutes and imposes a new code of conduct for enforcers. The Adams administration supports capping bounties but wants higher fines. Opponents, including the New York Clean Air Collective, say the bill 'weaponizes rules that chill participation' and will 'watch while companies like Con Ed, Verizon, and Amazon steal New York’s breath.'
