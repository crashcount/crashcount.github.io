A 79-year-old woman, walking with the signal at Glenwood and Flatbush, was killed by a bus making a left. A 53-year-old cyclist died after being ejected on Cortelyou Road. A 72-year-old man, crossing with the signal at Flatbush, was killed by a turning bus. These are not numbers. They are lives ended in the crosswalk, on the way home, in the middle of the day. In three and a half years, seven people have been killed on District 45 streets. Fifty have been seriously injured. Over 3,000 have been hurt. The pain does not fade. The street remembers every name. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The old. The young. The ones on foot, on bikes, on scooters. Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt. Cars and SUVs killed three. Buses killed two. Trucks and motorcycles left others broken. The dead crossed with the signal. The drivers turned left, looked away, or did not yield. The city calls these accidents. But the pattern is clear. The cost is paid by the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for and sponsored bills that chip at the edges. She backed laws for more <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>raised speed reducers</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>better pedestrian lighting</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalizing jaywalking</a>. She supported <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>truck route redesigns</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>crash investigations</a>. But the pace is slow.

Call Council Member Louis. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protected bike lanes, not just paint. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot speak.

The 21-year-old male motorcyclist was ejected and suffered a head injury with severe lacerations. The sedan driver, a 39-year-old man, was not seriously hurt. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors. The motorcyclist was not using safety equipment, as noted in the report, but only after the driver errors.

The bill reads: 'requiring taxis and for-hire vehicles to display a decal warning passengers to look for cyclists when opening the door.' Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Jennifer Gutiérrez and a long list of co-sponsors. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law orders all taxis and for-hire vehicles to post warning decals on rear passenger doors, alerting riders to check for cyclists before opening. The Taxi and Limousine Commission will provide the signs at no cost. The measure targets dooring, a common threat to cyclists.

The report states the woman was 'crossing with the signal.' She suffered severe bleeding from her eye and was listed as conscious at the scene. The driver, a 25-year-old man operating with only a permit, was uninjured. The point of impact was the truck's left front bumper. The police report does not list any driver contributing factors beyond 'Unspecified,' but the narrative makes clear the driver turned left into the path of a pedestrian who had the signal. No victim actions are cited as contributing factors. The collision underscores the persistent danger faced by pedestrians even when following traffic signals, especially at intersections where drivers turn across crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
