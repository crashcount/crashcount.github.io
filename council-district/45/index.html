In District 45, <strong>eight people have died and 3,145 have been injured</strong> in traffic crashes since 2022. Fifty-two were left with serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The living carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just last year, a 74-year-old woman was killed crossing Avenue D with the signal. The driver turned left and struck her. She died at the intersection. The cause: <strong>&ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to crash data</a>.</p><p>A 53-year-old woman on a bike was killed at Cortelyou Road and New York Avenue. The driver failed to yield. She was ejected and died at the scene. No helmet could save her. No law protected her. The street did not forgive.</p><h2 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm</strong>—three deaths, 494 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 38. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes, too, left their mark, but the toll is not the same. The weight of steel, the speed, the blind turn—these are the killers.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles, restore pavement markings, and boost plate enforcement. She sponsored a bill to give seniors bike share discounts. These are steps, but small ones.</p><p>But Louis also sponsored a bill to <strong>lower e-bike speeds to 15 mph</strong>. This targets the vulnerable, not the reckless. It does not stop the cars that kill. It does not slow the SUVs that crush. It does not fix the street.</p><h2 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h2><p>After a crash, the words are always the same. &ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said the driver</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

Judge Ventura issued a restraining order after Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld appealed the city’s move. The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.' The article highlights weak enforcement of parking rules and the city’s reversal against its own DOT’s safety plan.

The Department of Transportation will fine violators $650 per incident, using in-road sensors to detect excess weight. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Overweight trucks cause wear and tear on our roadways and we all pay the price through expensive repairs to our infrastructure." The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles.
