In District 45, <strong>eight people have died and 3,145 have been injured</strong> in traffic crashes since 2022. Fifty-two were left with serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The living carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just last year, a 74-year-old woman was killed crossing Avenue D with the signal. The driver turned left and struck her. She died at the intersection. The cause: <strong>&ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to crash data</a>.</p><p>A 53-year-old woman on a bike was killed at Cortelyou Road and New York Avenue. The driver failed to yield. She was ejected and died at the scene. No helmet could save her. No law protected her. The street did not forgive.</p><h2 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm</strong>—three deaths, 494 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 38. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes, too, left their mark, but the toll is not the same. The weight of steel, the speed, the blind turn—these are the killers.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles, restore pavement markings, and boost plate enforcement. She sponsored a bill to give seniors bike share discounts. These are steps, but small ones.</p><p>But Louis also sponsored a bill to <strong>lower e-bike speeds to 15 mph</strong>. This targets the vulnerable, not the reckless. It does not stop the cars that kill. It does not slow the SUVs that crush. It does not fix the street.</p><h2 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h2><p>After a crash, the words are always the same. &ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said the driver</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call Council Member Louis. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit.

Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.'

Cyclists called the move "unwise and unsafe." The article notes the city had previously identified this stretch as among the most dangerous. Officials responded to concerns by painting pedestrian islands and loading zones but did not install physical barriers or bus boarding islands. Cyclists described the decision as political, with one saying, "There’s a very important voting bloc that’s using their leverage over the mayor to remove the bike lane." The mayor’s refusal to sacrifice parking for safety left vulnerable road users exposed. The city’s Streets Master Plan, which mandates more protected lanes, remains unmet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
