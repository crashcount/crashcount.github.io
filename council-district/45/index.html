A 79-year-old woman, walking with the signal at Glenwood and Flatbush, was killed by a bus making a left. A 53-year-old cyclist died after being ejected on Cortelyou Road. A 72-year-old man, crossing with the signal at Flatbush, was killed by a turning bus. These are not numbers. They are lives ended in the crosswalk, on the way home, in the middle of the day. In three and a half years, seven people have been killed on District 45 streets. Fifty have been seriously injured. Over 3,000 have been hurt. The pain does not fade. The street remembers every name. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The old. The young. The ones on foot, on bikes, on scooters. Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt. Cars and SUVs killed three. Buses killed two. Trucks and motorcycles left others broken. The dead crossed with the signal. The drivers turned left, looked away, or did not yield. The city calls these accidents. But the pattern is clear. The cost is paid by the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for and sponsored bills that chip at the edges. She backed laws for more <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>raised speed reducers</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>better pedestrian lighting</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalizing jaywalking</a>. She supported <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>truck route redesigns</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>crash investigations</a>.

Call Council Member Louis. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protected bike lanes, not just paint. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot speak.

The 21-year-old male motorcyclist was ejected and suffered a head injury with severe lacerations. The sedan driver, a 39-year-old man, was not seriously hurt. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors. The motorcyclist was not using safety equipment, as noted in the report, but only after the driver errors.

The collision occurred at 18:06, when the teen stepped into the roadway outside a crosswalk or signal. The report states, 'A southbound SUV hits him head-on. The bumper strikes his face. He falls. Blood spills. He is awake, bleeding, cut deep.' Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, underscoring the driver’s failure to notice or respond to the pedestrian in time. The report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary cause remains the driver’s lack of attention. The impact left the teen conscious but badly injured, highlighting the persistent threat posed by inattentive driving on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The law requires the Department of Transportation to consult with the Fire Department before approving open street applications, bicycle lane projects, or major transportation projects. The official matter title states the law amends the city code to require DOT to consult with FDNY and notify affected firehouses before moving forward. Primary sponsor Kalman Yeger, with co-sponsors including Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, Lynn Schulman, and others, pushed the bill through. The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes. No safety analyst assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users. The law’s effect: more agencies weigh in, but the process for safer streets grows longer and more complex.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
