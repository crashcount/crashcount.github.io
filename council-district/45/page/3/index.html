In District 45, <strong>eight people have died and 3,145 have been injured</strong> in traffic crashes since 2022. Fifty-two were left with serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The living carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just last year, a 74-year-old woman was killed crossing Avenue D with the signal. The driver turned left and struck her. She died at the intersection. The cause: <strong>&ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to crash data</a>.</p><p>A 53-year-old woman on a bike was killed at Cortelyou Road and New York Avenue. The driver failed to yield. She was ejected and died at the scene. No helmet could save her. No law protected her. The street did not forgive.</p><h2 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm</strong>—three deaths, 494 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 38. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes, too, left their mark, but the toll is not the same. The weight of steel, the speed, the blind turn—these are the killers.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles, restore pavement markings, and boost plate enforcement. She sponsored a bill to give seniors bike share discounts. These are steps, but small ones.</p><p>But Louis also sponsored a bill to <strong>lower e-bike speeds to 15 mph</strong>. This targets the vulnerable, not the reckless. It does not stop the cars that kill. It does not slow the SUVs that crush. It does not fix the street.</p><h2 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h2><p>After a crash, the words are always the same. &ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said the driver</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call Council Member Louis. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit.

The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving. The article highlights the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill, which would require speed limiter devices for drivers with six or more camera violations in a year. Amber Adler, a local advocate, calls Ocean Parkway a 'safety menace' and urges passage of the bill.

Officers first noticed the vehicle due to stolen plates and tried to pull it over on Cropsey Avenue. The driver fled, leading police to set up a blockade. As the car tried to pass, an officer fired one round, striking the driver. The wounded man crashed into a police car and was later pronounced dead at Brookdale Hospital.

DA Eric Gonzalez called it "among the worst collisions he has seen" in 25 years. The crash killed Saada and her two daughters, ages eight and five; her four-year-old son was critically injured.

No students were on the bus at the time. The victims were hospitalized with serious injuries.

Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall to demand action. The article notes that auto deaths have outpaced gun deaths in New York City for two years. The bill mirrors laws for drunk driving and follows stalled efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act.
