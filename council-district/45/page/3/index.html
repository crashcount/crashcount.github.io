In District 45, <strong>eight people have died and 3,145 have been injured</strong> in traffic crashes since 2022. Fifty-two were left with serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The living carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just last year, a 74-year-old woman was killed crossing Avenue D with the signal. The driver turned left and struck her. She died at the intersection. The cause: <strong>&ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to crash data</a>.</p><p>A 53-year-old woman on a bike was killed at Cortelyou Road and New York Avenue. The driver failed to yield. She was ejected and died at the scene. No helmet could save her. No law protected her. The street did not forgive.</p><h2 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm</strong>—three deaths, 494 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 38. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes, too, left their mark, but the toll is not the same. The weight of steel, the speed, the blind turn—these are the killers.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles, restore pavement markings, and boost plate enforcement. She sponsored a bill to give seniors bike share discounts. These are steps, but small ones.</p><p>But Louis also sponsored a bill to <strong>lower e-bike speeds to 15 mph</strong>. This targets the vulnerable, not the reckless. It does not stop the cars that kill. It does not slow the SUVs that crush. It does not fix the street.</p><h2 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h2><p>After a crash, the words are always the same. &ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said the driver</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call Council Member Louis. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit.

Police identified a stolen Porsche, attempted a traffic stop, and set up a roadblock after the car evaded officers. According to the article, "Police say that officer fired one shot, striking the driver." The driver then crashed into an NYPD vehicle and later died at the hospital. A passenger was taken into custody. The incident drew a large police response, with one witness describing, "30 cops, oh my god, 40 cops, that's insane." The report highlights high-speed movement, a roadblock, and the use of deadly force. No officers were struck, but the event underscores risks in police pursuits and the dangers posed by fleeing vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Epps, unlicensed, "blew a stop sign" and struck a school bus, killing his passenger, Imani Vance, and injuring the bus driver. The article quotes Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez: "The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant's reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds." Epps left the scene, tried to escape in an Uber, and was arrested after fleeing on foot. The crash was one of three fatal Brooklyn incidents that weekend. City data cited in the article shows ongoing danger: at least 15 killed in Kings County so far this year, with thousands injured, often due to driver inattention and failure to yield.
