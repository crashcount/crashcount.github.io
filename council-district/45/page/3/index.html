A 79-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at Glenwood and Flatbush, was killed by a bus making a left. A 53-year-old cyclist was ejected and killed on Cortelyou Road. A 72-year-old man, walking with the signal at Flatbush and Avenue H, was crushed by a turning bus. These are not accidents. They are the price paid every week in District 45.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 913 people were injured and 21 suffered serious injuries in 1,154 crashes.</strong> Not one person killed this year—yet. But the scars run deep. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians.

Trucks and buses killed two, seriously injured four, and left 11 more hurt. Motorcycles and mopeds caused one serious injury. Bikes caused one moderate injury. The numbers are cold. The streets are colder.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for and sponsored bills to slow cars, add speed humps, daylight corners, and build protected bike lanes. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a> and end the blame game against pedestrians. She backed <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>truck route redesigns</a>. She raised concerns about cutting community input on bike lanes, slowing their rollout. She was absent for a vote on a 5 mph Open Streets limit. The work is not done. The danger is not gone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</strong> Call Council Member Louis. Demand she fight for a 20 mph speed limit, more protected bike lanes, and real enforcement. Demand she never put process over lives. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law orders DOT to publish every request for traffic signals and speed humps—case number, subject, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial, and timeline if approved. The public can now track what the city does, or fails to do, when streets need taming. This transparency exposes the machinery behind every crosswalk, signal, and speed bump—vital for anyone who walks, bikes, or rides in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
