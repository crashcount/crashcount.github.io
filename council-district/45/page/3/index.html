A 79-year-old woman, walking with the signal at Glenwood and Flatbush, was killed by a bus making a left. A 53-year-old cyclist died after being ejected on Cortelyou Road. A 72-year-old man, crossing with the signal at Flatbush, was killed by a turning bus. These are not numbers. They are lives ended in the crosswalk, on the way home, in the middle of the day. In three and a half years, seven people have been killed on District 45 streets. Fifty have been seriously injured. Over 3,000 have been hurt. The pain does not fade.

The young. The ones on foot, on bikes, on scooters. Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt. Cars and SUVs killed three. Buses killed two. Trucks and motorcycles left others broken. The dead crossed with the signal. The drivers turned left, looked away, or did not yield. The city calls these accidents. But the pattern is clear. The cost is paid by the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Farah N.

Prime sponsor: Carmen N. De La Rosa. Co-sponsors: Salamanca Jr., Gennaro, Brannan, Louis, Ung, Restler, Farías.

Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and Rafael Salamanca, Jr. back the measure. Their bill requires DOT to respond to each traffic request in three months, if practicable.
