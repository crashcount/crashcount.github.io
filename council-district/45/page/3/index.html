The corridor lacks basic pedestrian infrastructure and has 'long stretches without signalized crossings,' which encourages highway-speed driving through residential areas. The Department of Transportation is launching community workshops and an online feedback map to gather public input. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Brooklyn and Queens Residents deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk.'
