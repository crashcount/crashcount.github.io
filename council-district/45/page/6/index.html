A 79-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at Glenwood and Flatbush, was killed by a bus making a left. A 53-year-old cyclist was ejected and killed on Cortelyou Road.

She backed <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>truck route redesigns</a>. She raised concerns about cutting community input on bike lanes, slowing their rollout. She was absent for a vote on a 5 mph Open Streets limit. The work is not done.

Lawmakers filed it, but the session ended before passage.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0858-2022, introduced December 21, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, aimed to overhaul how New York City investigates vehicle collisions. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Farah N. Louis (primary) and co-sponsored by Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Shekar Krishnan, Charles Barron, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Lincoln Restler, and Rita C. Joseph, required the Department of Transportation to investigate all serious vehicular crashes. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to investigate vehicle collisions.' The bill would have expanded the definition of serious crashes, set strict investigation timelines, and mandated detailed public reports. It also called for reviews of street design and infrastructure at crash sites, with recommendations for safety improvements. The bill was filed at the end of the session and did not become law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Curbs shape the border between sidewalk and street. Broken curbs trip walkers, let cars mount sidewalks, and endanger the frail. The bill died in committee.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0596-2022 was introduced on July 14, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill required the Department of Transportation to repair any curb deemed a safety hazard during street resurfacing. The matter summary reads: 'requiring that the department of transportation repair broken curbs as part of resurfacing projects.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Schulman, Brewer, Dinowitz, Krishnan, Narcisse, Menin, Yeger, Avilés, Nurse, Gutiérrez, Riley, Brannan, Sanchez, and Louis. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. Broken curbs are a daily threat to pedestrians, especially the elderly and disabled. The bill would have forced the city to address these hazards as part of routine work, but the effort stalled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
