A 79-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at Glenwood and Flatbush, was killed by a bus making a left. A 53-year-old cyclist was ejected and killed on Cortelyou Road. A 72-year-old man, walking with the signal at Flatbush and Avenue H, was crushed by a turning bus. These are not accidents. They are the price paid every week in District 45.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 913 people were injured and 21 suffered serious injuries in 1,154 crashes.</strong> Not one person killed this year—yet. But the scars run deep. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians. No one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=who-bears-the-blame>Who Bears the Blame</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed three, left 12 with serious injuries, and caused 115 moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed two, seriously injured four, and left 11 more hurt. Motorcycles and mopeds caused one serious injury. Bikes caused one moderate injury. The numbers are cold. The streets are colder.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for and sponsored bills to slow cars, add speed humps, daylight corners, and build protected bike lanes. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a> and end the blame game against pedestrians. She backed <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>truck route redesigns</a>. She raised concerns about cutting community input on bike lanes, slowing their rollout. She was absent for a vote on a 5 mph Open Streets limit. The work is not done. The danger is not gone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</strong> Call Council Member Louis. Demand she fight for a 20 mph speed limit, more protected bike lanes, and real enforcement. Demand she never put process over lives. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Rita C. Joseph leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, Louis, Bottcher, Hudson, Gennaro, and Williams. The bill excludes law enforcement and city employees from eligibility. The aim is to mobilize the public to help solve hit-and-run cases, many of which remain unsolved, and bring justice for victims.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...requiring taxis and for-hire vehicles to display a decal warning passengers to look for cyclists when opening the door,' was sponsored by Lincoln Restler and co-sponsored by over twenty council members, including Gutiérrez, Hudson, and Rivera. The law mandates clear warning decals on all rear passenger doors of taxis and for-hire vehicles. The Taxi and Limousine Commission will provide the signs at no cost. The measure aims to cut down on 'dooring'—a threat to cyclists citywide. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 19:47, with both victims—aged 23 and 26—suffering severe lacerations and partial ejection from the scooter. The report states, 'A Lexus struck an e-scooter carrying two men. No helmets. Both thrown, torn, bleeding. Steel met flesh. Skin split open.' Both men were conscious but badly injured, left broken across the road. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The sedan driver, licensed in New York, was traveling straight ahead at the time of impact. The report also notes 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary failure remains with the distracted driver. The collision underscores the lethal consequences when drivers lose focus behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
