A 79-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at Glenwood and Flatbush, was killed by a bus making a left. A 53-year-old cyclist was ejected and killed on Cortelyou Road. A 72-year-old man, walking with the signal at Flatbush and Avenue H, was crushed by a turning bus. These are not accidents. They are the price paid every week in District 45.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 913 people were injured and 21 suffered serious injuries in 1,154 crashes.</strong> Not one person killed this year—yet.

Trucks and buses killed two, seriously injured four, and left 11 more hurt. Motorcycles and mopeds caused one serious injury. Bikes caused one moderate injury. The numbers are cold. The streets are colder.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for and sponsored bills to slow cars, add speed humps, daylight corners, and build protected bike lanes. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a> and end the blame game against pedestrians. She backed <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>truck route redesigns</a>. She raised concerns about cutting community input on bike lanes, slowing their rollout. She was absent for a vote on a 5 mph Open Streets limit. The work is not done. The danger is not gone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</strong> Call Council Member Louis. Demand she fight for a 20 mph speed limit, more protected bike lanes, and real enforcement. Demand she never put process over lives. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A Dodge SUV struck a 25-year-old man riding a ZHI motorcycle from behind, ejecting him and causing severe crush injuries to his entire body. The police report states the SUV's driver was inattentive or distracted, listing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The motorcyclist was left unconscious at the scene, his motorcycle demolished. The report further notes 'Alcohol Involvement' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors in the crash. The SUV's front end collided with the motorcycle's rear, a classic pattern of driver error and systemic danger for vulnerable road users. The police report records that the motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail appears only after the driver’s documented failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The collision occurred outside the crosswalk at 17:24. The report states, 'A sedan struck a 75-year-old man outside the crosswalk. His eye torn, blood on the asphalt. He stayed conscious.' The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The sedan’s left front bumper made contact, causing severe lacerations to the pedestrian’s eye. The report does not list any pedestrian behaviors as contributing factors. The focus remains on the driver’s distraction, which led to the violent impact and left the pedestrian injured on the roadway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The Council passed it on October 23, 2024; it became law November 22, 2024, as Local Law 113. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the department of transportation posting information on traffic-control device and speed reducer requests on its website.” Council Member Kalman Yeger led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law orders DOT to publish every request for traffic signals and speed humps—case number, subject, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial, and timeline if approved. The public can now track what the city does, or fails to do, when streets need taming. This transparency exposes the machinery behind every crosswalk, signal, and speed bump—vital for anyone who walks, bikes, or rides in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the vehicle's front end hit the pedestrian head-on, resulting in severe lacerations to his eye. The pedestrian remained conscious at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Aggressive Driving/Road Rage' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors in the collision. The pedestrian's behavior—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the driver's aggressive actions and failure to yield. The incident underscores the danger posed by aggressive driving and the systemic risks faced by people walking in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the SUV's driver, a 15-year-old boy, was ejected from the vehicle, found semiconscious and bleeding from the face. The narrative describes the front end of the SUV shattered and the rear of the stopped car folded inward. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The vehicle damage and point of impact confirm a violent crash. No mention is made of victim behavior as a contributing factor. The report centers driver distraction and improper lane use as the causes behind the severe injury and destruction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to consider placement of traffic enforcement agents in developing an interagency roadway safety plan," requires DOT to consider where traffic enforcement agents are stationed when drafting the city’s five-year safety plan. Sponsors include Council Member Justin L. Brannan (primary), Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, and the Queens Borough President (by request). The bill responds to Local Law 12 of 2011, which already mandates a safety plan, but this measure sharpens the focus: DOT must show where agents will be placed to protect the most dangerous corridors. The bill awaits further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill orders the Department of Transportation to study speed bumps and other speed-reducing measures for electric bikes in bike lanes. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law in relation to a department of transportation study on speed reducing measures for bicycles with electric assist operating in bicycle lanes.' Council Members Robert F. Holden, Justin L. Brannan, James F. Gennaro (primary sponsor), Farah N. Louis, Vickie Paladino, and David M. Carr back the bill. Their action: sponsorship and referral to committee. The study must pinpoint crash-prone spots and weigh the impact on all users. If speed bumps won’t work, DOT must suggest alternatives. The bill expires once the study is submitted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
