On 2025-07-05 a moped rider was killed at Clarendon Road and E 35 Street. On 2024-04-16 a 74‑year‑old woman crossing with the signal on Avenue D at New York Avenue was struck by a turning car and died.</p><p>These crashes are part of a larger pattern. Since 2022 in Council District 45 there have been 4,731 crashes, 3,371 people injured, 54 seriously injured, and 10 deaths (NYC Open Data). Cars and SUVs were involved in four pedestrian deaths here; trucks and buses in two.</p><p>Advocates and reporting make the toll human. “I was sad and angry at the same time because I still feel that these are things that can be prevented. I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed,” said Juan Ignacio Serra (Streetsblog, 2025-08-07).

Injuries concentrate in the afternoon into the evening. The district’s leading contributing factors include failure to yield and inattention/distraction. Cars and SUVs cause the bulk of pedestrian harm.</p><p>Short-term fixes that would reduce harm here: daylighting at key intersections, hardened turn protections (tighter radii and curb extensions), and leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs) at signalized crossings. Install protected bike lanes where people ride and deploy targeted enforcement during peak hours.</p><h2 id=what-louis-has-done>What Louis has done</h2><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis voted to speed removal of abandoned vehicles (Int 0857‑2024) and is the primary sponsor of a bill to require school‑frontage safety devices to be installed within 60 days after a DOT study (Int 1353‑2025, in committee). She has supported plate‑enforcement measures and bike‑share discounts for seniors. Those steps help, but the district still needs faster, broader action on speed and street design.</p><h2 id=citywide-fixes-tied-to-local-needs>Citywide fixes tied to local needs</h2><p>District 45’s data point to citywide solutions: lower NYC’s default residential speed limit to 20 mph and require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for habitual speeders. Those citywide policies must be paired with local DOT redesigns and enforcement so limits are respected where people live and travel.</p><h2 id=what-must-happen-now>What must happen now</h2><p>Make 20 mph the default on residential streets. Require speed limiters for repeat speeders. On Utica, Flatbush, and Foster: install LPIs, daylighting, hardened turn protections, and protected bike lanes where space allows. Press DOT to complete school‑zone devices within the 60‑day window in Int 1353‑2025 and to remove derelict vehicles under Int 0857‑2024 so sightlines stay clear.</p><p>Contact Council Member Farah N.
