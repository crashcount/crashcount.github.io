A 79-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at Glenwood and Flatbush, was killed by a bus making a left. A 53-year-old cyclist was ejected and killed on Cortelyou Road. A 72-year-old man, walking with the signal at Flatbush and Avenue H, was crushed by a turning bus. These are not accidents. They are the price paid every week in District 45.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 913 people were injured and 21 suffered serious injuries in 1,154 crashes.</strong> Not one person killed this year—yet. But the scars run deep. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians.

Trucks and buses killed two, seriously injured four, and left 11 more hurt. Motorcycles and mopeds caused one serious injury. Bikes caused one moderate injury. The numbers are cold. The streets are colder.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for and sponsored bills to slow cars, add speed humps, daylight corners, and build protected bike lanes. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a> and end the blame game against pedestrians. She backed <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>truck route redesigns</a>. She raised concerns about cutting community input on bike lanes, slowing their rollout. She was absent for a vote on a 5 mph Open Streets limit. The work is not done. The danger is not gone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</strong> Call Council Member Louis. Demand she fight for a 20 mph speed limit, more protected bike lanes, and real enforcement. Demand she never put process over lives. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days.

The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster.
