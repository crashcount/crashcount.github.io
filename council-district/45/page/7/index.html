The matter was introduced May 25, 2023, and filed at session’s end, never reaching enactment. The resolution’s title: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation that would create a surcharge for for-hire vehicles (FHVs) that would go towards funding the expansion of wheelchair accessible and all-electric FHVs.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, and Shahana K. Hanif sponsored the measure. The bill noted that only 4,858 of 95,129 FHVs were wheelchair accessible in 2022, and just 1% were all-electric. The measure aimed to close these gaps, but died in committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
