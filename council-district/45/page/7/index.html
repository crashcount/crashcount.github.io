In District 45, <strong>eight people have died and 3,145 have been injured</strong> in traffic crashes since 2022. Fifty-two were left with serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The living carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just last year, a 74-year-old woman was killed crossing Avenue D with the signal. The driver turned left and struck her. She died at the intersection. The cause: <strong>&ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to crash data</a>.</p><p>A 53-year-old woman on a bike was killed at Cortelyou Road and New York Avenue. The driver failed to yield. She was ejected and died at the scene. No helmet could save her. No law protected her. The street did not forgive.</p><h2 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm</strong>—three deaths, 494 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 38. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes, too, left their mark, but the toll is not the same. The weight of steel, the speed, the blind turn—these are the killers.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles, restore pavement markings, and boost plate enforcement. She sponsored a bill to give seniors bike share discounts. These are steps, but small ones.</p><p>But Louis also sponsored a bill to <strong>lower e-bike speeds to 15 mph</strong>. This targets the vulnerable, not the reckless. It does not stop the cars that kill. It does not slow the SUVs that crush. It does not fix the street.</p><h2 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h2><p>After a crash, the words are always the same. &ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said the driver</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

The bill demands the city install pedestrian lighting in at least 500 commercial corridors per year, aiming for a minimum of 1 footcandle (11 lux) on every sidewalk. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installation of pedestrian lighting fixtures.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Krishnan, Bottcher, and others. The committee has not yet voted. The bill’s text sets clear targets for coverage and contiguity, but action is stalled. Vulnerable road users remain in the dark until the city acts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 19:47, with both victims—aged 23 and 26—suffering severe lacerations and partial ejection from the scooter. The report states, 'A Lexus struck an e-scooter carrying two men. No helmets. Both thrown, torn, bleeding. Steel met flesh. Skin split open.' Both men were conscious but badly injured, left broken across the road. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The sedan driver, licensed in New York, was traveling straight ahead at the time of impact. The report also notes 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary failure remains with the distracted driver. The collision underscores the lethal consequences when drivers lose focus behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the cyclist was making a left turn when the SUV hit him head-on. The crash left the cyclist semiconscious with severe bleeding from a head injury. The SUV’s front end was crushed. Police list 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary cause remains the driver’s failure to yield. No injuries were reported for the SUV’s occupants. The scene was marked by violence and silence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
