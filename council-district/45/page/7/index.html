A 79-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at Glenwood and Flatbush, was killed by a bus making a left. A 53-year-old cyclist was ejected and killed on Cortelyou Road. A 72-year-old man, walking with the signal at Flatbush and Avenue H, was crushed by a turning bus. These are not accidents. They are the price paid every week in District 45.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 913 people were injured and 21 suffered serious injuries in 1,154 crashes.</strong> Not one person killed this year—yet.

Trucks and buses killed two, seriously injured four, and left 11 more hurt. Motorcycles and mopeds caused one serious injury. Bikes caused one moderate injury. The numbers are cold. The streets are colder.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for and sponsored bills to slow cars, add speed humps, daylight corners, and build protected bike lanes. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a> and end the blame game against pedestrians. She backed <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>truck route redesigns</a>. She raised concerns about cutting community input on bike lanes, slowing their rollout. She was absent for a vote on a 5 mph Open Streets limit. The work is not done. The danger is not gone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</strong> Call Council Member Louis. Demand she fight for a 20 mph speed limit, more protected bike lanes, and real enforcement. Demand she never put process over lives. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers want more frequent, reliable, and affordable transit. They warn of a looming fiscal cliff. Without action, riders face service cuts. The vote backs millions who depend on buses and trains.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0460-2023 was adopted by the City Council on April 27, 2023, after review by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0419-2022, filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, urges the New York State Legislature to require a statewide ballot proposal before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s congestion pricing plan—known as the Central Business District Tolling Program—can proceed. Introduced December 7, 2022, and filed at session’s end, the resolution states: “calls upon the New York State Legislature to amend state law to make implementation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s congestion pricing plan... subject to a statewide ballot proposal.” Council Member Kamillah Hanks led sponsorship, joined by Borelli, Carr, Louis, Yeger, Ariola, and Paladino. The sponsors raise concerns about pollution, health, and traffic impacts on outer-borough communities. The measure questions whether congestion pricing will cut traffic or fund transit improvements. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users is assessed. The bill remains filed, with no further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required NYPD to create a secure website for victims and families to access crash details, including investigation status, summonses, and witness information. It also mandated a Department of Transportation guide for collision victims, outlining rights to police reports and insurance information. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to resources for victims of motor vehicle collisions.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Mercedes Narcisse, and Lincoln Restler backed the bill. The bill was filed at session's end on December 31, 2023, without passage. Without this law, crash victims and their families still face barriers to basic information after life-altering collisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
