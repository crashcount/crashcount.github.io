A 79-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at Glenwood and Flatbush, was killed by a bus making a left. A 53-year-old cyclist was ejected and killed on Cortelyou Road.

She backed <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>truck route redesigns</a>.

According to police, Simpson "swiped an oncoming car" near Gates Avenue and Marcus Garvey Boulevard, then "drove away, dragging the person several feet and hitting another car with a pregnant woman inside." She struck a third, empty car before being arrested by city sheriffs. No one was seriously injured, though the pregnant woman was taken to a hospital for evaluation. Simpson faces charges of reckless endangerment, assault, and leaving the scene.

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the department of transportation posting information on traffic-control device and speed reducer requests on its website.” Council Member Kalman Yeger led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law orders DOT to publish every request for traffic signals and speed humps—case number, subject, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial, and timeline if approved. The public can now track what the city does, or fails to do, when streets need taming. This transparency exposes the machinery behind every crosswalk, signal, and speed bump—vital for anyone who walks, bikes, or rides in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report explicitly cites 'Aggressive Driving/Road Rage' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors in the collision. The pedestrian's behavior—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the driver's aggressive actions and failure to yield.

Riders with three or more moving violations must complete a DOT-run safety course. Fail, and their pedal-assist bike can be seized until proof of course completion.

The report states the SUV's driver, a 15-year-old boy, was ejected from the vehicle, found semiconscious and bleeding from the face. The narrative describes the front end of the SUV shattered and the rear of the stopped car folded inward. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The vehicle damage and point of impact confirm a violent crash. No mention is made of victim behavior as a contributing factor. The report centers driver distraction and improper lane use as the causes behind the severe injury and destruction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to consider placement of traffic enforcement agents in developing an interagency roadway safety plan," requires DOT to consider where traffic enforcement agents are stationed when drafting the city’s five-year safety plan. Sponsors include Council Member Justin L. Brannan (primary), Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, and the Queens Borough President (by request). The bill responds to Local Law 12 of 2011, which already mandates a safety plan, but this measure sharpens the focus: DOT must show where agents will be placed to protect the most dangerous corridors.
