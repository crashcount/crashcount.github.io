The bill reads: 'requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), David M. Carr, Sandra Ung, Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, and Vickie Paladino sponsor the measure. If DOT finds a location suitable, it must install a raised speed reducer within a year.

The crash occurred at 22:25 in Brooklyn. The report states the SUV’s driver was inattentive or distracted, listing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The impact crushed the sedan driver’s neck. The 27-year-old man, who was wearing a lap belt and harness, remained conscious after the collision. The police narrative describes the scene: 'A Hyundai SUV turned left. An Infiniti sedan went straight. The SUV struck the sedan’s side. A 27-year-old man, belted in, suffered crush injuries to his neck. He stayed awake. The street went quiet.' The report does not cite any contributing actions by the injured driver.
