Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass a Volkswagen, hit it, then struck two motorcycles. Both riders—Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21—died. Prosecutors charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. “He was drunk,” a sister said in the hallway outside court. “Two people were killed.” He was later released without bail while the case is reviewed, and the DA may upgrade charges, reporters noted. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a>, <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>amNY</a>.</p><p>Amarantepenalo made it to Montefiore by private car.

The Hutchinson River Parkway accounts for injuries again and again, and at least two deaths in this period. So does the Bruckner. Both rank among the worst local corridors. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Peak pain comes after dark. Injury counts stay high from late night through the small hours, with fatal spikes at 4 a.m., 8 a.m., 10 a.m., 4–5 p.m., 8–9 p.m., and 11 p.m. The pattern holds: nights and rush hours cut deep. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Bronxdale Avenue, serious injuries pile up. On the Hutchinson and the Bruckner, deaths follow the speed.

Nearly 3,000 were hurt. Pedestrians took the blows 384 times; four died. Cyclists crashed 132 times; one died. Most harm came from cars and SUVs, with trucks adding weight to the toll. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>SUVs and sedans are the main strike force against people on foot, with trucks close behind. In the rollup of pedestrian injuries, cars and SUVs dominate. Trucks kill, too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Contributing factors stack up as “other,” distraction, driver inexperience, and disregard for signals. Failure to yield injured 15 more. Unsafe speed appears in the data, but the crashes speak louder. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-hours-no-one-should-have-to-live-through>The hours no one should have to live through</h3><p>From midnight to 3 a.m., injuries stay steady. At 4 a.m., deaths spike. The evening brings another wave, peaking through 9 p.m. The 11 p.m. hour closes with two more dead. These are the hours families learn what happened. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Year to date, crashes are up more than half over last year’s pace.

Target the nighttime hours flagged by the data. Add lighting on dark approaches and ramp merges. Harden turns on East Tremont. Daylight corners on feeder roads. Post speed management and truck controls at the worst entries and exits.</p><p>Then scale what works citywide. Lower the default speed limit on local streets. The city has the power under Sammy’s Law; advocates are already pushing it. Mandate speed‑control tech for repeat speeders. The state bill on “super speeders” would force limiters on cars that rack up tickets or DMV points. These steps exist.

He was drunk. Think about how he took two lives.” That was a sister outside court. “How could they let him go?” a mother asked. The defense lawyer said his client will contest the charges. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>The highway reopened.

Police said the victim, aged 14 to 16, suffered head and wrist injuries after making contact with the train. The incident occurred just after 4 p.m. as the train approached the northbound platform. The MTA recently launched a campaign called 'Ride Inside, Stay Alive' and is testing barriers between subway cars to deter such incidents. According to the NYPD, at least one person has died from subway surfing this year; in 2024, six died, 15 were injured, and 229 were arrested.
