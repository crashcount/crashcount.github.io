Thirty-five left with injuries so severe they change a life.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, two more deaths, fifteen more serious injuries, and over 800 hurt. The streets run through <a href=/neighborhood/bx1002/>Throgs Neck</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bx1003/>Pelham Bay</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bx1102/>Morris Park</a>, and the pain runs with them.</p><p>On the Hutchinson River Parkway, before dawn, a Honda Pilot slams into a scooter. An 18-year-old woman is thrown onto the asphalt. She does not get up. &ldquo;An 18-year-old was in critical condition after being thrown from a moped in the hit-and-run, according to NYPD&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/7-hurt-in-crash-on-hutchinson-river-parkway-near-whitestone-bridge/>CBS New York</a>). The driver flees. Six others go to the hospital. The road is quiet again, but nothing is the same.</p><p>A year before, a 64-year-old cyclist is killed at Pierce Avenue and Williamsbridge Road. A pedestrian, 66, is crushed on the parkway. A 40-year-old man dies on Westchester Avenue. The list is long. The pain is longer.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Most of the dead and maimed are not behind the wheel.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons—three killed, six seriously hurt, 292 more injured by these machines in just three years. Trucks and buses take another life. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they hurt too, but the numbers are smaller. The risk is not shared equally.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Kristy Marmorato has signed on to bills for more street lighting and faster utility pole removal. These are steps, but small ones. She voted <strong>against safer medians</strong> (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council</a>), and <strong>against ending jaywalking enforcement</strong> (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council</a>), a law that would have protected those on foot from needless tickets and blame. She calls congestion pricing a &ldquo;cash grab&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/congestion-pricing-set-to-begin-at-midnight-sunday-as-federal-judge-clears-path-for-manhattan-toll/>amNY</a>), fighting a measure proven to cut traffic and save lives.</p><p>She defends parking mandates, saying, &ldquo;We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/03/opinion-its-time-to-say-no-to-car-drivers-and-yes-to-ending-parking-mandates>Streetsblog NYC</a>). But every new parking spot is another reason for a car to be on the road, another risk for a child crossing the street.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is a choice.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking. Demand an end to policies that put cars first and people last. The dead cannot speak.

He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users.

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, set to fund $15 billion in subway and rail improvements, drew fierce opposition from unions and Councilwoman Kristy Marmorato, who called it a 'cash grab' that would 'increase all costs in our daily lives.' The union for FDNY EMTs argued the toll would burden low-wage workers, but data shows 90% of commuters already use public transit. City officials, including mayoral spokesperson Liz Garcia, insisted emergency response would not suffer. The measure's summary notes that reducing car traffic will speed up emergency vehicles and protect passengers. The uproar highlights the tension between entrenched driving privileges and the urgent need to make streets safer for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
