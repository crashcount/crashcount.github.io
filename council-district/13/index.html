Thirty-five left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,500 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 66-year-old man crushed while crossing the Hutchinson River Parkway, a 40-year-old pedestrian struck down on Westchester Avenue, and a 64-year-old cyclist killed by a truck on Williamsbridge Road. The street does not care about age or reason. It takes what it wants.</p><p>A man tried to stop a thief from stealing his car on Wilkinson Avenue. He was dragged, left with a shattered leg and head trauma. He may never walk again. &ldquo;This has absolutely happened before,&rdquo; a neighbor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/26/bronx-carjacking-victim-leg-amputated-dragged-half-mile/>told the Daily News</a>. The car was found abandoned. The man was left behind.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-weight-of-policy>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Weight of Policy</h3><p>Council Member Kristy Marmorato has taken some steps. She co-sponsored bills to add lighting to step streets and commercial corridors, and to speed up utility pole removal—<strong>small moves that help, but do not change the street</strong>. She also voted <strong>against safer medians</strong> and <strong>against ending jaywalking enforcement</strong>, keeping old rules that punish the vulnerable and leave the road unchanged. She called congestion pricing a &ldquo;cash grab,&rdquo; ignoring the lives lost to traffic and the promise of safer, quieter streets (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/03/congestion-pricing-is-happening-cue-the-irrational-drama-from-the-placard-elite-from-the-suburbs>dismissed the lives lost to traffic</a>).</p><p>She fought to keep parking mandates near new Metro-North stations, saying, &ldquo;We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/03/opinion-its-time-to-say-no-to-car-drivers-and-yes-to-ending-parking-mandates>defended parking mandates</a>). More parking means more cars. More cars means more bodies in the street.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-more>The Next Step: Demand More</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> The council can lower speed limits, redesign streets, and end policies that put drivers first. The mayor and DOT can act now. But they will not move unless you make them. Call, write, show up. <strong>Demand safer streets. Demand action.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.'

The union for FDNY EMTs argued the toll would burden low-wage workers, but data shows 90% of commuters already use public transit.

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers. Streets belong to people again.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now Local Law 98 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 26, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Richards opposes lifting mandates in Queens, citing poor transit. Marmorato lobbied to restore mandates in a Bronx rezoning near new Metro North stations, arguing, 'We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities.' The editorial rebukes this logic, stating, 'We should not cling to parking mandates when we know they encourage car ownership, make streets less vibrant, increase rents, and pollute our air.' The piece urges officials to break the cycle of car-first policy, invest in transit, and end mandates that block affordable housing and safer streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the editorial centers the harm parking mandates inflict on vulnerable road users and the city’s livability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident occurred at night, with the man crossing the dark roadway outside a crosswalk. The report states, 'Four cars struck him. One after another. Crush injuries. Whole body. No signal. No time. He died there, under headlights, beneath steel and speed.' All vehicles involved were traveling straight ahead, with points of impact listed as undercarriage, right front bumper, center front end, and left front quarter panel.
