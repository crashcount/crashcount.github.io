Seventeen seriously hurt. In the last twelve months, District 13 saw 1,305 crashes. Nine hundred twenty-seven people left with injuries. These are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, families waiting in hospital halls, shoes left on the asphalt.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-the-slow-disaster>Recent Crashes: The Slow Disaster</h2><p>On July 11, a 79-year-old driver in Co-op City crashed into two cars and a pole. His 71-year-old passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died. Seven others were hurt. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>said the cause of the crash was not immediately known</a>. No arrests. No answers. A witness <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>described the aftermath: &ldquo;One lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body.

The victims went to the hospital.

Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—three deaths, six serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, seriously hurt one. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—fewer deaths, but the risk is always there. Children, the elderly, the ones moving slowest, pay the highest price.</p><h2 id=leadership-small-steps-big-gaps>Leadership: Small Steps, Big Gaps</h2><p>Council Member Kristy Marmorato voted yes on bills to remove abandoned vehicles and add warning decals to taxi doors. She co-sponsored bills for better lighting on step streets and faster removal of sidewalk hazards. But she also fought to keep parking mandates near new transit, calling the Bronx a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/07/bronx-metro-north-rezoning-parking-mandates>&ldquo;transit desert where cars are a necessity&rdquo;</a>. She called congestion pricing a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/03/congestion-pricing-is-happening-cue-the-irrational-drama-from-the-placard-elite-from-the-suburbs>&ldquo;cash grab&rdquo;</a>. The council passed laws to clear derelict cars and warn about dooring, but the streets remain dangerous. The big fights—slower speeds, fewer cars, safer crossings—are still waiting.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Marmorato. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and an end to policies that put cars first. Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
