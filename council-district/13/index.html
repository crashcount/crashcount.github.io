Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are among the dead. The streets do not forgive. Just days ago, a 31-year-old man was killed on Pelham Parkway when a driver turned left and struck his motorcycle. Police reported that &ldquo;the Equinox driver stayed at the scene&rdquo; and both were taken to the hospital, but only one survived (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/29/motorcycle-rider-dies-crash-bronx-near-bruckner-expressway/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p><strong>Pedestrians are not spared.</strong> Last year, a 40-year-old man was killed by an SUV on Westchester Avenue. The crash report lists &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo; and &ldquo;Driver Inexperience&rdquo; as causes. He died in the street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Kristy Marmorato has taken some steps. She co-sponsored bills to add lighting to step streets and commercial corridors, a move that could help walkers at night. But when it mattered most, she voted <strong>no</strong> on laws that would have made medians safer and ended jaywalking enforcement—measures proven to protect the most vulnerable. She called congestion pricing a &ldquo;cash grab,&rdquo; ignoring the evidence that less traffic means fewer deaths (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/03/congestion-pricing-is-happening-cue-the-irrational-drama-from-the-placard-elite-from-the-suburbs>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p><strong>Parking, not people, gets priority.</strong> Marmorato fought to keep parking mandates near new Metro-North stations, saying, &ldquo;We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/07/bronx-metro-north-rezoning-parking-mandates>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The result: more cars, more danger, less room for life.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward-no-more-waiting>The Path Forward: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a policy failure. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and end the reign of reckless drivers. The time for half-measures is over. Call Council Member Marmorato. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand safer crossings, protected bike lanes, and an end to policies that put cars over kids. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Change it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Judge Maldonado found Rivera's use of deadly force unjustified, writing it 'requires more than the mere possibility of danger.' Tisch disagreed, citing a 'split-second decision' and risk to another officer. The stop began over a seatbelt. Feliz tried to flee; Rivera fired once, killing him.

He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users.
