Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass a Volkswagen, hit it, then struck two motorcycles. Both riders—Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21—died. Prosecutors charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. “He was drunk,” a sister said in the hallway outside court. “Two people were killed.” He was later released without bail while the case is reviewed, and the DA may upgrade charges, reporters noted. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a>, <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>amNY</a>.</p><p>Amarantepenalo made it to Montefiore by private car.

The Hutchinson River Parkway accounts for injuries again and again, and at least two deaths in this period. So does the Bruckner. Both rank among the worst local corridors. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Peak pain comes after dark. Injury counts stay high from late night through the small hours, with fatal spikes at 4 a.m., 8 a.m., 10 a.m., 4–5 p.m., 8–9 p.m., and 11 p.m. The pattern holds: nights and rush hours cut deep. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Bronxdale Avenue, serious injuries pile up.

Nearly 3,000 were hurt. Pedestrians took the blows 384 times; four died. Cyclists crashed 132 times; one died.

In the rollup of pedestrian injuries, cars and SUVs dominate. Trucks kill, too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Contributing factors stack up as “other,” distraction, driver inexperience, and disregard for signals. Failure to yield injured 15 more. Unsafe speed appears in the data, but the crashes speak louder. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-hours-no-one-should-have-to-live-through>The hours no one should have to live through</h3><p>From midnight to 3 a.m., injuries stay steady. At 4 a.m., deaths spike. The evening brings another wave, peaking through 9 p.m. The 11 p.m. hour closes with two more dead. These are the hours families learn what happened. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Year to date, crashes are up more than half over last year’s pace.

Target the nighttime hours flagged by the data. Add lighting on dark approaches and ramp merges. Harden turns on East Tremont. Daylight corners on feeder roads. Post speed management and truck controls at the worst entries and exits.</p><p>Then scale what works citywide. Lower the default speed limit on local streets. The city has the power under Sammy’s Law; advocates are already pushing it. Mandate speed‑control tech for repeat speeders. The state bill on “super speeders” would force limiters on cars that rack up tickets or DMV points. These steps exist.

Prosecutors charged him with DWI; he was released without bail. The article quotes a victim's sister: "Two people were killed. He was drunk." Police say Neyra Yuyes tried to pass another car, hit it, and caused a deadly chain reaction. The district attorney is still investigating, and charges may be upgraded.
