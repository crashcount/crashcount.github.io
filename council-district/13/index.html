Thirty-five left with injuries so severe they change a life.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, two more deaths, fifteen more serious injuries, and over 800 hurt. The streets run through <a href=/neighborhood/bx1002/>Throgs Neck</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bx1003/>Pelham Bay</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bx1102/>Morris Park</a>, and the pain runs with them.</p><p>On the Hutchinson River Parkway, before dawn, a Honda Pilot slams into a scooter. An 18-year-old woman is thrown onto the asphalt. She does not get up. &ldquo;An 18-year-old was in critical condition after being thrown from a moped in the hit-and-run, according to NYPD&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/7-hurt-in-crash-on-hutchinson-river-parkway-near-whitestone-bridge/>CBS New York</a>). The driver flees. Six others go to the hospital. The road is quiet again, but nothing is the same.</p><p>A year before, a 64-year-old cyclist is killed at Pierce Avenue and Williamsbridge Road. A pedestrian, 66, is crushed on the parkway. A 40-year-old man dies on Westchester Avenue. The list is long. The pain is longer.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Most of the dead and maimed are not behind the wheel.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons—three killed, six seriously hurt, 292 more injured by these machines in just three years. Trucks and buses take another life. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they hurt too, but the numbers are smaller. The risk is not shared equally.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Kristy Marmorato has signed on to bills for more street lighting and faster utility pole removal. These are steps, but small ones. She voted <strong>against safer medians</strong> (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council</a>), and <strong>against ending jaywalking enforcement</strong> (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council</a>), a law that would have protected those on foot from needless tickets and blame. She calls congestion pricing a &ldquo;cash grab&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/congestion-pricing-set-to-begin-at-midnight-sunday-as-federal-judge-clears-path-for-manhattan-toll/>amNY</a>), fighting a measure proven to cut traffic and save lives.</p><p>She defends parking mandates, saying, &ldquo;We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/03/opinion-its-time-to-say-no-to-car-drivers-and-yes-to-ending-parking-mandates>Streetsblog NYC</a>). But every new parking spot is another reason for a car to be on the road, another risk for a child crossing the street.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is a choice.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking. Demand an end to policies that put cars first and people last. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The man now fights for life at Jacobi hospital.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on April 25, 2025, that a 32-year-old JFK Airport baggage handler was critically injured in a violent Bronx carjacking. After leaving his car running outside a restaurant, a suspect jumped in and sped off. The victim clung to the door as the car accelerated. Detectives told ABC7 the suspect 'intentionally sideswiped a parked car,' knocking the man to the ground. The victim suffered head trauma and lost his left leg. The stolen Infiniti was later found abandoned, showing crash damage. The Bronx has seen a 3.6% rise in car thefts this year, even as rates fall citywide. The incident highlights the lethal risks of vehicle theft and the urgent need for systemic interventions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
