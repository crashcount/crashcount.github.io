Thirty-five left with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In just the last three and a half years, District 13 has seen 4,201 crashes. Two thousand five hundred ninety-four people hurt.

These are steps, but small ones. She voted <strong>against safer medians</strong> and <strong>against ending jaywalking enforcement</strong>—measures proven to protect people on foot. She calls congestion pricing a &ldquo;cash grab&rdquo; and fights to keep parking mandates, even as more cars mean more danger for everyone. When the city had a chance to put people before cars, she chose the status quo.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member Marmorato. Demand she back real safety: lower speed limits, protected crossings, and fewer cars.

He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users.

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.'

They claim tolls hurt workers and raise costs. Facts show most commuters use transit. Fewer cars mean faster emergency response. The toll funds transit upgrades. The drama masks real safety gains for all.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2025, public debate erupted as New York City prepared to activate congestion pricing in Manhattan. The measure, set to fund $15 billion in subway and rail improvements, drew fierce opposition from unions and Councilwoman Kristy Marmorato, who called it a 'cash grab' that would 'increase all costs in our daily lives.' The union for FDNY EMTs argued the toll would burden low-wage workers, but data shows 90% of commuters already use public transit. City officials, including mayoral spokesperson Liz Garcia, insisted emergency response would not suffer. The measure's summary notes that reducing car traffic will speed up emergency vehicles and protect passengers. The uproar highlights the tension between entrenched driving privileges and the urgent need to make streets safer for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred before dawn and left five young adults semiconscious and pinned inside the wreckage, suffering head, chest, and neck injuries. The police report states, 'Five young adults, semiconscious, pinned in twisted steel. Head, chest, neck—broken. Parked cars struck.' The report explicitly lists 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor, and also notes the presence of alcohol at the scene. Multiple parked vehicles were hit in the aftermath. The data shows all injured persons were vehicle occupants, with no evidence of pedestrian or cyclist involvement. The violence of the impact and the resulting injuries underscore the danger when speed and impairment intersect on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children.
