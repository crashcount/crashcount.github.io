Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass a Volkswagen, hit it, then struck two motorcycles. Both riders—Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21—died. Prosecutors charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. “He was drunk,” a sister said in the hallway outside court. “Two people were killed.” He was later released without bail while the case is reviewed, and the DA may upgrade charges, reporters noted. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a>, <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>amNY</a>.</p><p>Amarantepenalo made it to Montefiore by private car. Martinez was rushed to Jacobi. Neither survived. Police closed the southbound lanes near Exit 9. The highway reopened.

The Hutchinson River Parkway accounts for injuries again and again, and at least two deaths in this period. So does the Bruckner. Both rank among the worst local corridors. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Peak pain comes after dark. Injury counts stay high from late night through the small hours, with fatal spikes at 4 a.m., 8 a.m., 10 a.m., 4–5 p.m., 8–9 p.m., and 11 p.m. The pattern holds: nights and rush hours cut deep. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Bronxdale Avenue, serious injuries pile up. On the Hutchinson and the Bruckner, deaths follow the speed. These are the repeat sites. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-by-whom>Who gets hurt, and by whom</h3><p>Since 2022, eleven people have died here. Nearly 3,000 were hurt. Pedestrians took the blows 384 times; four died. Cyclists crashed 132 times; one died. Most harm came from cars and SUVs, with trucks adding weight to the toll. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>SUVs and sedans are the main strike force against people on foot, with trucks close behind. In the rollup of pedestrian injuries, cars and SUVs dominate. Trucks kill, too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Contributing factors stack up as “other,” distraction, driver inexperience, and disregard for signals. Failure to yield injured 15 more. Unsafe speed appears in the data, but the crashes speak louder. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-hours-no-one-should-have-to-live-through>The hours no one should have to live through</h3><p>From midnight to 3 a.m., injuries stay steady. At 4 a.m., deaths spike. The evening brings another wave, peaking through 9 p.m. The 11 p.m. hour closes with two more dead. These are the hours families learn what happened. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Year to date, crashes are up more than half over last year’s pace.

Target the nighttime hours flagged by the data. Add lighting on dark approaches and ramp merges. Harden turns on East Tremont. Daylight corners on feeder roads. Post speed management and truck controls at the worst entries and exits.</p><p>Then scale what works citywide. Lower the default speed limit on local streets. The city has the power under Sammy’s Law; advocates are already pushing it. Mandate speed‑control tech for repeat speeders. The state bill on “super speeders” would force limiters on cars that rack up tickets or DMV points. These steps exist.

He was drunk. Think about how he took two lives.” That was a sister outside court. “How could they let him go?” a mother asked. The defense lawyer said his client will contest the charges. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>The highway reopened.

The city moves closer to breaking car dependence in transit deserts.</p><p class=mb3>On January 5, 2024, the City Council held a public input session on the plan to open four new Metro-North stations in East Bronx. The proposal, nearing the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) certification, aims to serve Co-op City, Morris Park, Parkchester/Van Nest, and Hunts Point. The session, supported by Councilmember Kristy Marmorato (District 13) and Councilmember Amanda Farias, highlighted the need for faster, more reliable transit. Marmorato said, 'the Metro-North will provide an alternative for drivers dealing with congestion pricing, and for those who might be reluctant to take the subway.' Farias called it part of a 'better transit future.' The Department of City Planning updated residents, reflecting ongoing community feedback. The plan has bipartisan support and promises to reshape transit for neighborhoods long underserved by safe, fast options.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
