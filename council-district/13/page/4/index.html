Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are among the dead. The streets do not forgive. Just days ago, a 31-year-old man was killed on Pelham Parkway when a driver turned left and struck his motorcycle. Police reported that &ldquo;the Equinox driver stayed at the scene&rdquo; and both were taken to the hospital, but only one survived (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/29/motorcycle-rider-dies-crash-bronx-near-bruckner-expressway/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p><strong>Pedestrians are not spared.</strong> Last year, a 40-year-old man was killed by an SUV on Westchester Avenue. The crash report lists &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo; and &ldquo;Driver Inexperience&rdquo; as causes. He died in the street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Kristy Marmorato has taken some steps. She co-sponsored bills to add lighting to step streets and commercial corridors, a move that could help walkers at night. But when it mattered most, she voted <strong>no</strong> on laws that would have made medians safer and ended jaywalking enforcement—measures proven to protect the most vulnerable. She called congestion pricing a &ldquo;cash grab,&rdquo; ignoring the evidence that less traffic means fewer deaths (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/03/congestion-pricing-is-happening-cue-the-irrational-drama-from-the-placard-elite-from-the-suburbs>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p><strong>Parking, not people, gets priority.</strong> Marmorato fought to keep parking mandates near new Metro-North stations, saying, &ldquo;We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/07/bronx-metro-north-rezoning-parking-mandates>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The result: more cars, more danger, less room for life.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward-no-more-waiting>The Path Forward: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a policy failure. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and end the reign of reckless drivers. The time for half-measures is over. Call Council Member Marmorato. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand safer crossings, protected bike lanes, and an end to policies that put cars over kids. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Change it.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
