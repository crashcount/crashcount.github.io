A pedestrian left dying in the street after a hit-and-run. In the last twelve months, <strong>816 people were injured and 2 killed</strong> in crashes across District 13. Fifteen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry the story in scars.</p><p>On a spring morning, a carjacker dragged a man half a block.

She co-sponsored bills to light up dark step streets and commercial corridors, and to speed up utility pole removal—measures that help walkers see and be seen. But when it comes to the hard fights, she has stood in the way. She voted <strong>against safer medians</strong> and <strong>against ending jaywalking enforcement</strong>—laws proven to protect people on foot. She called congestion pricing a &ldquo;cash grab,&rdquo; ignoring the lives it could save by reducing car traffic <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/03/congestion-pricing-is-happening-cue-the-irrational-drama-from-the-placard-elite-from-the-suburbs>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>She fought to keep parking mandates near new transit stations, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/07/bronx-metro-north-rezoning-parking-mandates>arguing</a>, &ldquo;We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities.&rdquo; More parking means more cars. More cars mean more bodies in the street.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people walking and biking. End laws that punish the dead for crossing the street. Demand your leaders act. Call Council Member Marmorato. Tell her to put people before parking. Tell her to vote for life, not delay.</p><p><strong>If you wait, the blood will not stop.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The committee rejected the Adams administration's push to eliminate parking requirements, instead voting to retain mandates and lower building heights. Marmorato argued, "We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities," and prioritized drivers over reducing car dependency. The proposal, part of the Mayor's 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' plan, aimed to boost affordable housing and transit-oriented development. Marmorato's stance, echoed in multiple statements, keeps parking at the center and limits safer, walkable streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the move preserves car dominance and its dangers for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Transit-Oriented Bronx Developments Will Have Ample Parking, Developers Tell Council,' focused on whether to require parking in new residential and commercial projects. Council Members Amanda Faris, Kevin C. Riley, Rafael Salamanca, and Kristy Marmorato all pressed for developers to include parking, despite the city's move to waive mandates. Riley called parking 'a huge issue.' Developers, including Baker Development, promised up to 200 spaces per project. Bronx City Planning Director Paul Philips said, 'We certainly expect developers to provide parking.' The debate ignored the danger more parking brings: more cars, more conflict, more risk for people walking and biking. No safety analyst weighed in, but the outcome is clear—transit-oriented in name, car-centric in practice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
