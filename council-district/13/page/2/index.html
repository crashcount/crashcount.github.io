Police say a 21-year-old in a Mercedes tried to pass, clipped a Volkswagen, then hit two motorcycles. Both riders died. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He went home that day.</p><blockquote><p>“Two people were killed. He was drunk.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>said a victim’s sister</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Police have arrested and charged a man with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>reported Gothamist</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“He looks forward to [contesting the charges] in court,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>his lawyer said</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Names were released. Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19. Enrique Martinez, 21. Both from the Bronx. The highway closed for hours near Gun Hill Road. Families will carry this for years.</p><p>—</p><h3 id=where-the-blood-pools>Where the blood pools</h3><p>District 13’s worst wounds run along the parkways and expressways. The <a href=#>Hutchinson River Parkway</a> logged two deaths and 209 injuries. The <a href=#>Bruckner Expressway</a> had one death and 336 injuries. <a href=#>Bronxdale Ave</a> shows 16 injuries and seven serious. These are not quirks. They are patterns.</p><p>Night hits hard here. Fatal and severe harm spikes at 4–8 a.m., 5–7 p.m., 8–11 p.m., and again near midnight, with deaths recorded at 4, 8, 10, 16, 17, 20, 21, and 23 hours in the data window. People keep getting hit when the light is thin and the lanes are wide.</p><p>Across the district since 2022: 4 people killed and 1,084 injured in 1,512 crashes over the last 12 months tracked. Pedestrians: 4 dead, 384 hurt. Cyclists: 1 dead, 133 hurt. The bulk of harm falls on people outside the steel shell.</p><p>—</p><h3 id=whats-driving-it>What’s driving it</h3><p>The city’s data groups most deaths and injuries under “other,” with 4 deaths, 603 injuries, 16 serious injuries. Distraction adds another death. Blown signals add a death. Inexperience adds a death. Failures to yield and speed show up with dozens more injuries.</p><p>The machines that do the most damage are common ones. Sedans and SUVs account for most pedestrian harm: 143 pedestrian injuries and 2 pedestrian deaths from SUVs; 138 injuries and 1 death from sedans. Trucks killed one pedestrian. Heavy vehicles are not the only killers. Ordinary cars do enough.</p><p>—</p><h3 id=the-familys-question>The family’s question</h3><p>On the parkway case, the charges were filed. The driver was released without bail that day. A mother asked, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“How could they let him go?”</a> The DA said the investigation continues. The roadway reopened. Two funerals followed.</p><p>—</p><h3 id=hotspots-that-wont-cool>Hotspots that won’t cool</h3><p>Hutchinson River Parkway. Bruckner Expressway. Bronxdale Ave. East Tremont Avenue. These are the repeat scenes. People are ejected. People are pinned. Families wait at Jacobi and Montefiore.</p><p>The hours after dark demand light and friction. Daylighting at corners. Longer walk leads. Hardened lefts where turns maim. Concrete, not paint. Targeted enforcement in the late‑night and rush windows listed above. Focus where the bodies fall.</p><p>—</p><h3 id=use-the-tools-that-work>Use the tools that work</h3><p>Speed is the blade. Albany handed the city the power to set safer limits. New Yorkers can demand a default 20 mph on local streets now. Cameras are funded through 2030. The worst repeat speeders need speed limiters before they kill again. These are live fights.</p><p>Read how to push City Hall and Albany, and how to back the groups built for this. Act today: <a href=/take_action/>Take action</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The union for FDNY EMTs argued the toll would burden low-wage workers, but data shows 90% of commuters already use public transit. City officials, including mayoral spokesperson Liz Garcia, insisted emergency response would not suffer. The measure's summary notes that reducing car traffic will speed up emergency vehicles and protect passengers.
