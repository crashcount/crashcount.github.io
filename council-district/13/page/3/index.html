Seventeen seriously hurt. In the last twelve months, District 13 saw 1,305 crashes. Nine hundred twenty-seven people left with injuries. These are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, families waiting in hospital halls, shoes left on the asphalt.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-the-slow-disaster>Recent Crashes: The Slow Disaster</h2><p>On July 11, a 79-year-old driver in Co-op City crashed into two cars and a pole. His 71-year-old passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died. Seven others were hurt. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>said the cause of the crash was not immediately known</a>. No arrests. No answers. A witness <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>described the aftermath: &ldquo;One lady was out on the ground.

Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—three deaths, six serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, seriously hurt one. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—fewer deaths, but the risk is always there. Children, the elderly, the ones moving slowest, pay the highest price.</p><h2 id=leadership-small-steps-big-gaps>Leadership: Small Steps, Big Gaps</h2><p>Council Member Kristy Marmorato voted yes on bills to remove abandoned vehicles and add warning decals to taxi doors. She co-sponsored bills for better lighting on step streets and faster removal of sidewalk hazards. But she also fought to keep parking mandates near new transit, calling the Bronx a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/07/bronx-metro-north-rezoning-parking-mandates>&ldquo;transit desert where cars are a necessity&rdquo;</a>. She called congestion pricing a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/03/congestion-pricing-is-happening-cue-the-irrational-drama-from-the-placard-elite-from-the-suburbs>&ldquo;cash grab&rdquo;</a>. The council passed laws to clear derelict cars and warn about dooring, but the streets remain dangerous. The big fights—slower speeds, fewer cars, safer crossings—are still waiting.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Marmorato. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and an end to policies that put cars first.

According to the police report, the sedan driver suffered severe injuries, including chest trauma and an arm amputation, but remained conscious at the scene. The report states the sedan 'slammed into the back of a slowing Mack truck,' with the impact crushing the driver’s chest and folding the bumper 'like paper.' Police explicitly cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors. The truck was slowing or stopping when struck. The report makes no mention of any actions by the truck driver contributing to the crash. The focus remains on the sedan driver’s failure to pay attention and maintain a safe distance, as detailed in the official account.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

Richards opposes lifting mandates in Queens, citing poor transit. Marmorato lobbied to restore mandates in a Bronx rezoning near new Metro North stations, arguing, 'We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities.' The editorial rebukes this logic, stating, 'We should not cling to parking mandates when we know they encourage car ownership, make streets less vibrant, increase rents, and pollute our air.' The piece urges officials to break the cycle of car-first policy, invest in transit, and end mandates that block affordable housing and safer streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the editorial centers the harm parking mandates inflict on vulnerable road users and the city’s livability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The committee rejected the Adams administration's push to eliminate parking requirements, instead voting to retain mandates and lower building heights. Marmorato argued, "We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities," and prioritized drivers over reducing car dependency. The proposal, part of the Mayor's 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' plan, aimed to boost affordable housing and transit-oriented development. Marmorato's stance, echoed in multiple statements, keeps parking at the center and limits safer, walkable streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the move preserves car dominance and its dangers for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users face more cars, more risk.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2024, the City Council held a hearing on proposed rezonings around new Metro-North stations in the Bronx. The matter, titled 'Transit-Oriented Bronx Developments Will Have Ample Parking, Developers Tell Council,' focused on whether to require parking in new residential and commercial projects. Council Members Amanda Faris, Kevin C. Riley, Rafael Salamanca, and Kristy Marmorato all pressed for developers to include parking, despite the city's move to waive mandates. Riley called parking 'a huge issue.' Developers, including Baker Development, promised up to 200 spaces per project. Bronx City Planning Director Paul Philips said, 'We certainly expect developers to provide parking.' The debate ignored the danger more parking brings: more cars, more conflict, more risk for people walking and biking. No safety analyst weighed in, but the outcome is clear—transit-oriented in name, car-centric in practice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
