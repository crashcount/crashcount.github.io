Twenty-five left with serious injuries. Over 3,200 hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers—they are mothers, sons, neighbors, children. In the last twelve months alone, two more lives ended on our streets. Nearly a thousand injured. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>Just days ago, a BMW crashed on the Belt Parkway. The car hit the divider, vaulted into oncoming traffic, and caught fire. Two people died. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>said no one in the BMW was wearing a seat belt</a>. The flames left nothing but metal and grief. A brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>remembered his sister: &ldquo;Jewel was a loving, energetic mother who dreamed of entering the medical field so she could help others the way she always helped others.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On July 8, a crane slammed into a city bus in Queens Village. Four were hurt. A passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>said, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delays>Leadership: Progress and Delays</h3><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has backed bills to make streets safer. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills for better pedestrian lighting</a>, solar crosswalks, and safer street design. She <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/us-news/grandma-76-killed-when-e-bike-battery-explodes-like-blowtorch-inside-nyc-pizzeria-on-fourth-of-july-fdny/>called for a task force to study e-bike safety</a>, but the bill sits stalled in committee. On the city’s plan to redesign truck routes and daylight intersections, Williams was absent when the committee advanced the bill. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>NY Daily News</a></p><p><strong>Some progress. Too much delay.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next-action-not-excuses>What Comes Next: Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>This crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without change is another day someone does not come home. Call Council Member Williams. Demand she push for faster action on stalled safety bills. Demand daylighting at every intersection, lower speed limits, and real protection for people outside cars. Join with others. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>The disaster is slow. The fix is slower.

The resolution states: 'The Council of the City of New York calls on the MTA to make permanent the Access-A-Ride On-Demand E-Hail Pilot Program.' Council Member Nantasha M. Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Riley, Cabán, Brannan, and Hanif. The program, launched in 2017, lets people with disabilities and seniors book paratransit rides on demand, not days in advance. Ridership jumped from 7,386 to 22,372 monthly trips in one year. The council wants the MTA to expand access and improve service. The resolution centers vulnerable riders, demanding transit that meets their needs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
