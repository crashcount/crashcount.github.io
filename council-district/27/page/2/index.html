In the last 12 months, District 27 saw 1 death, 9 serious injuries, and 1,498 crashes. 991 neighbors were hurt. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared. The wounds are fresh. The pain is old.</p><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway, struck the divider, and vaulted into oncoming cars. Six people were left broken. Two are fighting for their lives. Police closed the road and the city moved on. The driver then struck a gray 2016 CR-V, as well as a red 2022 Hyundai, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/belt-parkway-car-accident-queens-leaves-several-injured/16968309/>reported ABC7</a>. The NYPD&rsquo;s Collision Investigation Squad is still probing. It was unclear what caused the driver to lose control but police said speed may have been an issue, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>said the New York Post</a>.</p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. In three years, cars and trucks have injured 499 people walking or biking here. Trucks and buses add dozens more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are in the mix, but the carnage is driven by heavy steel and speed. Children are not spared: 89 kids were hurt in the last year alone.</p><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has backed bills to daylight intersections, study safer street designs, and boost pedestrian lighting. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished walkers instead of drivers. But some bills she co-sponsored—like those for better lighting and e-bike safety—are still stalled in committee. She was absent for a key vote to redesign deadly truck routes. Progress is slow. The streets are not waiting.</p><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by the city. Call Council Member Williams. Demand she push for a citywide 20 mph speed limit, more protected crossings, and real accountability for repeat dangerous drivers. The blood on the street is not washed away by words. Only action will do.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>See how to take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
