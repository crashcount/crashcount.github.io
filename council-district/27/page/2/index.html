Over 3,300 injured.</strong> That is the toll on District 27’s streets since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Two children killed. Four elders. The rest, working men and women, some young, some old. In the last year alone, 1,081 people were hurt, ten of them so badly they may never walk the same.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a 39-year-old man was killed on Nashville Boulevard, ejected from his motorized scooter after a driver turned left across his path.</strong> The city called it <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>driver inattention</a>. He died in the street. No time for goodbyes.</p><p>On the Cross Island Parkway, speed and chaos are routine. A BMW vaults the median. A woman, 76, dies in the back seat. Her name is not in the data. Only her age, her seat, her fate.</p><h3 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h3><p>After the bus crash in Flushing, a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>described</a> the chaos: &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo; Eight people were hurt. The driver had fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation drags on.</p><p>A mother with a baby at the stop <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said</a>, &ldquo;That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.&rdquo; The burden shifts to her. The curb is not safe. The sidewalk is not safe. Nowhere is safe.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has voted for bills to clear abandoned vehicles, add pavement markings, and warn taxi passengers about dooring. She co-sponsored a bill to curb repeat speeders and another to boost pedestrian lighting. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p><strong>No law has slowed the cars. No bill has stopped the SUVs from crushing bones.</strong> The most dangerous drivers—those with dozens of camera tickets—still roam free. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not done so.</p><h3 id=the-next-move-is-yours>The Next Move Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Williams. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.</strong> Do not wait for another child’s name to become a number. The street will not forgive delay.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
