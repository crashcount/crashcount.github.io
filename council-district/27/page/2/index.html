Kennedy International Airport, then fled the scene, police said. Medics took the man to Jamaica Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police told reporters, “The driver sped off without stopping,” and investigators searched for surveillance footage to identify the vehicle (NY Daily News; ABC7).</p><h3 id=the-toll-in-district-27>The toll in District 27</h3><p>Since 2022, 13 people have been killed and 30 were seriously injured on streets in Council District 27, according to city crash data. A December 4, 2023 crash on Jamaica Avenue at 146th Street killed a 62-year-old moped passenger. Cross Island Parkway is the deadliest corridor here (four deaths), followed by Farmers Boulevard (two deaths).</p><p>The district’s serious-injury counts peak in daylight hours — around 2 p.m. — so lunchtime and afternoon trips are especially risky.</p><h3 id=local-patterns-and-vehicle-types>Local patterns and vehicle types</h3><p>City records show recurring contributing factors in District 27: failure to yield and inattention/distraction are frequent. Cars and SUVs account for the bulk of pedestrian injuries (570 total crashes; seven serious), while trucks and buses account for far fewer incidents (43 total; two serious). These patterns point to speed and turning conflicts as the main drivers of harm.</p><h3 id=where-it-keeps-happening--and-what-would-stop-it>Where it keeps happening — and what would stop it</h3><p>Hotspots: Cross Island Parkway and Farmers Boulevard.</p><p>Concrete, local fixes that address the documented patterns:</p><ul><li>Daylighting and leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs) at signalized intersections and turning conflict points on Farmers Boulevard and Francis Lewis Boulevard.</li><li>Hardened turns, raised crosswalks, and median refuges at Cross Island Parkway access points and service-road crossings to reduce vehicle speeds and protect crossing pedestrians.</li><li>Targeted enforcement: mobile speed cameras and periodic speed enforcement patrols focused on known hotspots, plus accelerated removal of abandoned vehicles that block sightlines.</li></ul><h3 id=what-council-member-williams-has-done>What Council Member Williams has done</h3><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams voted for measures including the decriminalization of jaywalking (Int 0346-2024), faster removal of abandoned vehicles (Int 0857-2024), and taxi dooring-warning decals (Int 0193-2024). She co-sponsored a resolution calling for action on repeat speeders (Res 0854-2025) and recently sponsored Int 1347-2025 addressing unlicensed commuter vans; that bill is in committee. Those votes matter, but they haven&rsquo;t stopped the deaths.</p><h3 id=what-must-change-now--local-actions-and-citywide-fixes>What must change now — local actions and citywide fixes</h3><p>Local: flood the district’s hotspots with daylighting, LPIs, hardened turns, raised crossings, median refuges, and targeted enforcement in the highest-risk corridors.</p><p>Citywide: two policy priorities should follow District 27’s evidence — lower New York City’s default speed limit so streets are slower by design, and require intelligent speed-assistance devices for habitual speeders. These steps align with broader state and city conversations about speed cameras and repeat offenders and would reduce the lethal gap between a 20 mph and 30 mph strike.</p><p>Call Council Member Williams at 718-527-4356 or email <a href=mailto:district27@council.nyc.gov>district27@council.nyc.gov</a>. Demand 20 mph streets, intelligent speed limiters for repeat violators, and fast DOT action at Cross Island Parkway and Farmers Boulevard. Until speeds drop and turns are tamed, our streets will keep taking people.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
