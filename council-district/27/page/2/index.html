In the last twelve months, over 1,000 people were injured in crashes. Nine suffered injuries so severe the city calls them &ldquo;serious.&rdquo; No one was spared by age—children, elders, workers, all bled on the asphalt. In three years, 11 people died. The numbers do not flinch. They do not comfort. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians are not safe. In May, a man tried to cross Linden Boulevard. A car hit him. Another ran him over. The first driver fled. The second stayed. The man died the next day. Police are still searching for the driver who left him in the street. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/queens/man-killed-after-hit-run-crash-queens-police-say>Police are still searching for the first driver who fled the scene.</a></p><p>In December, a driver ran down Gary Charlotin on Hempstead Avenue, stopped, then dragged him for blocks. Bystanders screamed. The driver sped away. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz called it <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/03/queens-hit-and-run-crash-arrest-murder-warren-rollins-gary-charlotin/>&ldquo;a complete disregard for human life.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has co-sponsored bills to boost pedestrian lighting, create a crossing guard advisory board, and study safer street designs. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing streets built for speed, not safety. She backed daylighting at intersections and new greenway plans. But on the bill to redesign truck routes—where trucks kill and maim—she was absent. Some bills she supports are still stuck in committee, their promises unkept.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-action-not-excuses>The Road Ahead: Action, Not Excuses</h2><p>District 27 is still bleeding. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can build more protected crossings. It can enforce the laws that matter. But it will not move unless pushed. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p>Call your council member. Demand safer streets.

Council Member Rita C. Joseph leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, Louis, Bottcher, Hudson, Gennaro, and Williams.

The law requires the Department of Transportation to publish a monthly-updated, searchable map of all city bike lanes. The map must show obstructions, construction, crash patterns, shared paths, conflict points, resurfacing, parking, bike share docks, open streets, repair shops, and reporting tools. The bill’s matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to develop a map of bicycle infrastructure conditions.' Council Member Crystal Hudson sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Sanchez, Stevens, Yeger, Restler, Avilés, and others. The law brings sunlight to hidden hazards, giving vulnerable road users the facts they need to see the city’s dangers in plain sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023.
