Police records show a head wound and severe bleeding in that crash <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Since Jan 1, 2022, District 27 has recorded <strong>18 people killed</strong> and <strong>4,851 injured</strong> on its streets. Police have flagged <strong>40 serious injuries</strong> in that span. These are the city’s own numbers <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-turns-against-you>Where the street turns against you</h3><p>Five people have died along the Cross Island Parkway in this district. Three more on Jamaica Avenue. Those corridors keep showing up in crash logs <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>At intersections, police repeatedly record drivers <strong>disregarding traffic control</strong> (1 death, 31 injuries) and <strong>failing to yield</strong> (1 serious injury, 34 injuries). These are the boxes checked on MV-104 reports, again and again <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>The worst hour is around <strong>8 PM</strong>, with four deaths logged then. Darkness comes, and the numbers rise <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>People walking carry the brunt: <strong>4 pedestrians killed</strong>, <strong>839 injured</strong> here since 2022. People on bikes were hurt <strong>213</strong> times. Most pedestrian injuries involve drivers in cars and SUVs; trucks and buses trail far behind in the count <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pace-is-not-slowing>The pace is not slowing</h3><p>Measured year to date, crashes in this district are up <strong>8.0%</strong> from last year.

The line keeps climbing <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Speed is the lever that moves the body count. As the State Senate has said, “<strong>Speed cameras have cut speeding by over 60% in locations where installed</strong>.” The tool works where we put it to work <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/senate-protects-new-york-students-and-pedestrians>NYS Senate</a>.</p><h3 id=who-holds-the-wrench>Who holds the wrench</h3><p>Council Member Nantasha M. Williams has voted to clear abandoned cars from sightlines and crosswalks, a small but real fix (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857-2024</a>). She also backed dooring warnings in taxis (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0193-2024</a>).</p><p>But the centerline remains speed. The Council can set safer defaults. The state can rein in repeat speeders. Williams now sponsors a bill to crack down on unlicensed commuter vans (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347-2025</a>). The deadliest harm, though, still comes from drivers going too fast for human bodies to survive <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=what-will-stop-the-next-siren>What will stop the next siren</h3><p>Start where the bodies fall: daylight corners on Jamaica Avenue and Farmers Boulevard; give pedestrians head starts; harden turns; route trucks off neighborhood streets. Then finish the job citywide: lower the default speed and fit habitual speeders with electronic limiters. These are the tools we have <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> — and the steps our own advocates lay out <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</p><p>One boy bled at Hillside and Parsons.
