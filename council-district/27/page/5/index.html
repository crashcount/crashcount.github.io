She co-sponsored efforts to boost pedestrian lighting and study safer street designs. She voted yes to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street, as shown in <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>.</p><p>But some bills stall. The promise of brighter sidewalks and safer e-bike routes sits in committee. The city studies. The danger waits for no one.</p><p>Williams has spoken on the need to curb speeding and redesign streets. But the work is unfinished. Streets in Jamaica, St. Albans, and Hollis remain deadly. &ldquo;We can and must do better as a city,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/03/vision-zero-epicenters-5-dangerous-neighborhoods-that-should-be-on-eric-adamss-agenda>said a fellow council member</a>, but the blood on the road says not enough has changed.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-fight-for-every-life>What Comes Next: The Fight for Every Life</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main threat.</strong> In the last three years, they caused nearly 500 pedestrian injuries in District 27. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The city has the power to lower speed limits and redesign streets. It has the power to act now.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand action, not studies.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another family shattered. The numbers will not mourn. The city must act.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

East New York, East Flatbush, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, Jamaica. Council members speak. Some call for bike lanes, street redesigns, real safety. Others hesitate. The toll mounts. Streets remain hostile. Vision Zero falters.</p><p class=mb3>This council action, highlighted in a January 3, 2022 Streetsblog NYC article, spotlights deadly streets in East New York, East Flatbush, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, and Jamaica. The matter, 'Vision Zero Epicenters: 5 Dangerous Neighborhoods that Should Be on Eric Adams’s Agenda,' draws statements from council members. Charles Barron (East New York) showed initial reluctance but later acknowledged the need for safety and equity. Rita Joseph (East Flatbush) demanded urgent improvements, saying, 'We can and must do better as a city.' Chi Ossé (Bedford-Stuyvesant) called for expanded safe corridors. Lincoln Restler (Williamsburg) pushed for 'Vision Zero on steroids' and a network of protected bike lanes. Nantasha Williams (Jamaica) recognized the need for redesigns to curb speeding. The council’s stance: most support protected bike lanes, street redesigns, and Vision Zero policy, but action lags as deaths and injuries climb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
