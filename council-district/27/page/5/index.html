Nine hundred eighty-four injuries. Eight lives changed forever by serious injury.</strong> That is the price District 27 has paid in the last year alone. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on asphalt, families waiting by hospital beds, children who do not come home.</p><p>Just days ago, a <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>BMW tore across the Belt Parkway</a>, hit the divider, and vaulted into oncoming traffic. Two young lives ended. Three more in the car survived, battered. Two other drivers, struck without warning, survived. &ldquo;Jewel was a loving, energetic mother who dreamed of entering the medical field so she could help others the way she always helped others,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>said her brother</a>. The horror did not end there. In the last twelve months, children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians have all been hit. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In this district, they caused nearly 500 pedestrian injuries, including seven serious ones. Trucks and buses added dozens more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own scars. The violence is not random. It is relentless. It is preventable.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has shown up for some fights. She voted yes on bills to daylight intersections, calm traffic near seniors, and legalize jaywalking—ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing streets built for speed. She co-sponsored bills to boost pedestrian lighting and study safer street designs. But some efforts stall. Some bills sit in committee, waiting. When the Council advanced a law to redesign deadly truck routes, Williams was absent. &ldquo;I have some questions. Just from the wreck, it looks like maybe alcohol or speeding related. I am surprised that more people weren’t seriously hurt or injured,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>said a family member after the Belt Parkway crash</a>. The questions keep coming. The answers do not.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Williams. Demand action—not studies, not delays. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets where a mother can walk her child and come home alive. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. <strong>Make them choose life.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
