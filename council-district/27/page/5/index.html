Twenty-five left with serious injuries. Over 3,200 hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers—they are mothers, sons, neighbors, children. In the last twelve months alone, two more lives ended on our streets. Nearly a thousand injured. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>Just days ago, a BMW crashed on the Belt Parkway. The car hit the divider, vaulted into oncoming traffic, and caught fire. Two people died. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>said no one in the BMW was wearing a seat belt</a>. The flames left nothing but metal and grief. A brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>remembered his sister: &ldquo;Jewel was a loving, energetic mother who dreamed of entering the medical field so she could help others the way she always helped others.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On July 8, a crane slammed into a city bus in Queens Village. Four were hurt. A passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>said, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delays>Leadership: Progress and Delays</h3><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has backed bills to make streets safer. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills for better pedestrian lighting</a>, solar crosswalks, and safer street design. She <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/us-news/grandma-76-killed-when-e-bike-battery-explodes-like-blowtorch-inside-nyc-pizzeria-on-fourth-of-july-fdny/>called for a task force to study e-bike safety</a>, but the bill sits stalled in committee. On the city’s plan to redesign truck routes and daylight intersections, Williams was absent when the committee advanced the bill. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>NY Daily News</a></p><p><strong>Some progress. Too much delay.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next-action-not-excuses>What Comes Next: Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>This crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without change is another day someone does not come home. Call Council Member Williams. Demand she push for faster action on stalled safety bills. Demand daylighting at every intersection, lower speed limits, and real protection for people outside cars. Join with others. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>The disaster is slow. The fix is slower.

The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.
