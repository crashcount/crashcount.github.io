In the last twelve months, over 1,000 people were injured in crashes. Nine suffered injuries so severe the city calls them &ldquo;serious.&rdquo; No one was spared by age—children, elders, workers, all bled on the asphalt. In three years, 11 people died.

She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing streets built for speed, not safety. She backed daylighting at intersections and new greenway plans. But on the bill to redesign truck routes—where trucks kill and maim—she was absent. Some bills she supports are still stuck in committee, their promises unkept.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-action-not-excuses>The Road Ahead: Action, Not Excuses</h2><p>District 27 is still bleeding. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can build more protected crossings. It can enforce the laws that matter. But it will not move unless pushed.

The bill aimed to prohibit commercial establishments—repair shops, rental agencies, maintenance shops—from parking, storing, or idling vehicles on city streets. The matter summary states: 'This bill would prohibit commercial establishments from parking vehicles on city streets as part of their business.' Civil penalties ranged from $250 to $400 per day, with possible impoundment. Sponsors included Kalman Yeger (primary), Carlina Rivera, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kevin C. Riley, Marjorie Velázquez, Erik D. Bottcher, Nantasha M. Williams, and Robert F. Holden. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst assessment was provided.

Stevens led as primary sponsor, joined by 26 co-sponsors including Hudson, Williams, Restler, Krishnan, and others.
