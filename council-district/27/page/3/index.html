A van turned left; the man never got up. Paramedics rushed him to Long Island Jewish Medical Center, but he did not survive. Police said, &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>amny</a>).</p><p>Two days later, two people on a moped collided with a BMW in Jamaica. Both were injured. The NYPD said, &ldquo;two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, District 27 saw <strong>1,511 crashes, 1 death, and 998 injuries</strong>. Six people suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has voted for bills to daylight intersections and calm traffic near seniors. She co-sponsored laws for better lighting, safer crossings, and more transparency. She voted yes to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She backed a bill to study safer street designs for e-bikes and scooters, but that bill sits stalled in committee. Williams was absent when the council advanced a citywide truck route redesign—leaving a gap where leadership was needed most.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars cause most injuries and deaths.</strong> In this district, they hit, maim, and kill more than any other vehicle. Trucks and buses follow. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to redesign streets. It has the power to act. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p><h3 id=act-now>Act Now</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Nantasha Williams. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighted corners, protected bike lanes, and real enforcement against reckless drivers.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law, sponsored by Gale A. Brewer with co-sponsors including Erik D. Bottcher, Lincoln Restler, and others, amends the city code to require the Department of Transportation to report on vehicles with license plates unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems. The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The reports must be public and sent to the Mayor and Council Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passing on October 19, 2023, and became law on November 19, 2023. The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C. Riley (primary), with Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Hanif, Brewer, Restler, and Rivera as co-sponsors, the bill demands DOT report, by neighborhood, on safety infrastructure investment, crash rates, and demographics. It shines a light on which districts get safety upgrades and which are left exposed. The roadmap aims to close the gap for underserved areas, forcing transparency and accountability for every dollar spent on street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
