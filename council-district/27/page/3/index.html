Thousands Hurt. Who Will Stop the Blood on Queens Streets?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 9, 2025</p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>District 27: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 9, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-toll-in-blood-and-steel>The Toll in Blood and Steel</h2><p>In District 27, the numbers do not lie. Thirteen people have died on these streets since 2022. Another 3,256 have been injured. Twenty-five were left with wounds so grave they may never walk the same again. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. The road does not care who you are.</p><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway, vaulting the divider and slamming into oncoming cars. Two young lives ended in fire and metal. Police said, &ldquo;No one in the doomed BMW was wearing a seat belt&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>NY Daily News</a>. The crash shut down the highway. The rest of the city kept moving.</p><p>On July 8, a crane smashed into a city bus in Queens Village. Windows shattered. Four people were hurt. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us,&rdquo; said passenger Emily McKinnon, still shaken <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>ABC7</a>. She was afraid to ride again, but had no choice. The city offers no other way.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The most vulnerable pay the highest price. In the last twelve months, 989 people were hurt in crashes here. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are struck down by cars and trucks. SUVs and sedans alone caused over 500 injuries to people on foot or bike. Trucks and buses added dozens more. The street is a gauntlet.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-and-silences>Leadership: Steps and Silences</h2><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has voted for bills to daylight intersections, calm traffic near seniors, and legalize crossing the street outside the lines <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>. She co-sponsored measures to boost pedestrian lighting and study safer street designs. But when the council moved to overhaul the city’s deadly truck routes, Williams was absent. Too many bills stall in committee. Too many studies, not enough action.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Williams. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person who walks, rides, or waits for the bus. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity.

No more hiding the gaps.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1164-2023, now enacted, amends the city code to require an 'investment roadmap' in every Streets Master Plan starting December 1, 2026. The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passing on October 19, 2023, and became law on November 19, 2023. The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C. Riley (primary), with Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Hanif, Brewer, Restler, and Rivera as co-sponsors, the bill demands DOT report, by neighborhood, on safety infrastructure investment, crash rates, and demographics. It shines a light on which districts get safety upgrades and which are left exposed. The roadmap aims to close the gap for underserved areas, forcing transparency and accountability for every dollar spent on street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
