Twenty-seven left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 3,300 hurt since 2022. Each number is a body, a family, a future cut short. In the last year alone, two people died and over 1,000 were injured in crashes on these streets (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Just days ago, a 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of a BMW on the Cross Island Parkway. The car changed lanes, struck another, and caught fire. She never made it home (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>NY Daily News</a>). On July 8, a crane slammed into a city bus in Queens Village. Emily McKinnon, a passenger, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>said</a>, <strong>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us.&rdquo;</strong> Four were injured. She <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>added</a>, <strong>&ldquo;The bus driver didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong&mldr; all of a sudden you&rsquo;re like, oh my God, this happened to me?&rdquo;</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> They account for over 500 injuries to pedestrians in this district. Trucks and buses add dozens more. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the carnage comes on four wheels, not two (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Children are not spared. In the past year, 76 people under 18 were injured. One was killed. The old are not spared. One death among those over 75. The violence is steady, unyielding, and it does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has voted for daylighting, greenways, and traffic calming near seniors. She co-sponsored bills to boost pedestrian lighting, study safer street designs, and crack down on illegal parking. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).</p><p>But some bills stall. The push for better lighting sits in committee. The task force on e-bike safety is still just talk. Williams was absent for the vote to overhaul truck routes—a law meant to clear sight lines and protect people at intersections (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).</p><h2 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next?

The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
