The report describes the scene: 'A 9-year-old boy on a bike, no helmet, struck by a northbound Lincoln. Head wound. Blood pooled on the pavement. The sedan’s right front crumpled. The child stayed conscious.' The crash left the child with a severe head injury and heavy bleeding. The police report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor. The report notes the boy was not wearing a helmet, but places this detail after the collision and does not cite it as a cause. The sedan’s right front bumper bore the brunt of the impact. No driver errors are cited in the police report.
