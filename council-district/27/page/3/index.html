In the last twelve months, over 1,000 people were injured in crashes. Nine suffered injuries so severe the city calls them &ldquo;serious.&rdquo; No one was spared by age—children, elders, workers, all bled on the asphalt. In three years, 11 people died. The numbers do not flinch. They do not comfort. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians are not safe. In May, a man tried to cross Linden Boulevard. A car hit him. Another ran him over. The first driver fled. The second stayed. The man died the next day. Police are still searching for the driver who left him in the street. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/queens/man-killed-after-hit-run-crash-queens-police-say>Police are still searching for the first driver who fled the scene.</a></p><p>In December, a driver ran down Gary Charlotin on Hempstead Avenue, stopped, then dragged him for blocks. Bystanders screamed. The driver sped away. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz called it <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/03/queens-hit-and-run-crash-arrest-murder-warren-rollins-gary-charlotin/>&ldquo;a complete disregard for human life.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has co-sponsored bills to boost pedestrian lighting, create a crossing guard advisory board, and study safer street designs. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing streets built for speed, not safety. She backed daylighting at intersections and new greenway plans. But on the bill to redesign truck routes—where trucks kill and maim—she was absent. Some bills she supports are still stuck in committee, their promises unkept.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-action-not-excuses>The Road Ahead: Action, Not Excuses</h2><p>District 27 is still bleeding. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can build more protected crossings. It can enforce the laws that matter. But it will not move unless pushed. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p>Call your council member. Demand safer streets.

The Department of Transportation cut Jamaica Avenue’s busway hours from 24/7 to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, while Archer Avenue remains round-the-clock. The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) launched the one-year, 24/7 busway pilot to speed up commutes for over 250,000 daily bus riders. Williams called her district a 'car community' and argued, 'there's only one metric of success for the bus lane and not looking comprehensively at how it's actually impacting the community.' Brooks-Powers claimed, 'People cannot access our local businesses.' Both members urged the city to end or shorten the pilot, citing business and driver complaints. DOT and transit advocates countered that bus speeds improved. The DOT plans to continue the pilot and survey businesses and riders at its end.
