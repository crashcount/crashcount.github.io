In the last twelve months, over 1,000 people were injured in crashes. Nine suffered injuries so severe the city calls them &ldquo;serious.&rdquo; No one was spared by age—children, elders, workers, all bled on the asphalt. In three years, 11 people died. The numbers do not flinch. They do not comfort. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians are not safe. In May, a man tried to cross Linden Boulevard. A car hit him. Another ran him over. The first driver fled. The second stayed. The man died the next day. Police are still searching for the driver who left him in the street. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/queens/man-killed-after-hit-run-crash-queens-police-say>Police are still searching for the first driver who fled the scene.</a></p><p>In December, a driver ran down Gary Charlotin on Hempstead Avenue, stopped, then dragged him for blocks. Bystanders screamed. The driver sped away. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz called it <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/03/queens-hit-and-run-crash-arrest-murder-warren-rollins-gary-charlotin/>&ldquo;a complete disregard for human life.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has co-sponsored bills to boost pedestrian lighting, create a crossing guard advisory board, and study safer street designs. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing streets built for speed, not safety. She backed daylighting at intersections and new greenway plans. But on the bill to redesign truck routes—where trucks kill and maim—she was absent. Some bills she supports are still stuck in committee, their promises unkept.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-action-not-excuses>The Road Ahead: Action, Not Excuses</h2><p>District 27 is still bleeding. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can build more protected crossings. It can enforce the laws that matter. But it will not move unless pushed. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p>Call your council member. Demand safer streets. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
