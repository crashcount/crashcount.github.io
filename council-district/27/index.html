In the last twelve months, over 1,000 people were injured in crashes. Nine suffered injuries so severe the city calls them &ldquo;serious.&rdquo; No one was spared by age—children, elders, workers, all bled on the asphalt. In three years, 11 people died. The numbers do not flinch. They do not comfort. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians are not safe. In May, a man tried to cross Linden Boulevard. A car hit him. Another ran him over. The first driver fled. The second stayed. The man died the next day. Police are still searching for the driver who left him in the street. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/queens/man-killed-after-hit-run-crash-queens-police-say>Police are still searching for the first driver who fled the scene.</a></p><p>In December, a driver ran down Gary Charlotin on Hempstead Avenue, stopped, then dragged him for blocks. Bystanders screamed. The driver sped away. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz called it <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/03/queens-hit-and-run-crash-arrest-murder-warren-rollins-gary-charlotin/>&ldquo;a complete disregard for human life.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has co-sponsored bills to boost pedestrian lighting, create a crossing guard advisory board, and study safer street designs. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing streets built for speed, not safety. She backed daylighting at intersections and new greenway plans. But on the bill to redesign truck routes—where trucks kill and maim—she was absent. Some bills she supports are still stuck in committee, their promises unkept.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-action-not-excuses>The Road Ahead: Action, Not Excuses</h2><p>District 27 is still bleeding. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can build more protected crossings. It can enforce the laws that matter. But it will not move unless pushed. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p>Call your council member. Demand safer streets.

A Mack truck strikes a woman outside the roadway. Her shoulder torn, blood pooling. Sirens slice the air. The driver walks away as the city absorbs another wound.</p><p class=mb3>A Mack truck traveling west on Liberty Avenue near 150th Street struck a 56-year-old woman who was standing outside the roadway, according to the police report. The report states the truck was 'slowing or stopping' when its right front bumper hit the pedestrian, causing severe lacerations to her upper arm and shoulder. The woman was left semiconscious at the scene, her blood marking the pavement. Police explicitly cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the crash overall. The driver, a 56-year-old man, remained licensed and walked away from the scene. The police report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The incident underscores the persistent danger posed by large vehicles and driver inattention on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No other vehicles or road users were involved, and no victim behaviors are cited as contributing factors. The police narrative underscores the systemic danger posed by aggressive driving, with the crash ending in silence and loss.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Introduced February 28, 2024, it calls for an advisory board on school crossing guard deployment. The board would include the NYPD, Department of Transportation, and Department of Education. According to the bill summary: 'Such advisory board would be responsible for submitting biannual reports, relating to recommended deployment of school crossing guards, to the Mayor, the City Council Speaker and the Police Commissioner.' Council Member Kamillah Hanks leads as primary sponsor, joined by Stevens, Schulman, Salaam, Won, Cabán, Riley, Farías, Restler, Williams, Narcisse, Banks, Louis, Brooks-Powers, Marmorato, and the Bronx Borough President. The bill demands city agencies work together, but it does not guarantee more guards or safer crossings. The danger for children at city intersections remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle," forces the NYPD to add 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a specific reporting category in quarterly and annual use of force reports. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Won, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Avilés, Abreu, Ossé, Krishnan, Williams, Cabán, Nurse, Sanchez, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force. This change brings police violence by car into the light, exposing patterns that endanger pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Rita C. Joseph leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, Louis, Bottcher, Hudson, Gennaro, and Williams.
