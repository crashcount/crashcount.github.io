Police records show a head wound and severe bleeding in that crash <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Since Jan 1, 2022, District 27 has recorded <strong>18 people killed</strong> and <strong>4,851 injured</strong> on its streets. Police have flagged <strong>40 serious injuries</strong> in that span. These are the city’s own numbers <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-turns-against-you>Where the street turns against you</h3><p>Five people have died along the Cross Island Parkway in this district. Three more on Jamaica Avenue. Those corridors keep showing up in crash logs <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>At intersections, police repeatedly record drivers <strong>disregarding traffic control</strong> (1 death, 31 injuries) and <strong>failing to yield</strong> (1 serious injury, 34 injuries). These are the boxes checked on MV-104 reports, again and again <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>The worst hour is around <strong>8 PM</strong>, with four deaths logged then. Darkness comes, and the numbers rise <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>People walking carry the brunt: <strong>4 pedestrians killed</strong>, <strong>839 injured</strong> here since 2022. People on bikes were hurt <strong>213</strong> times. Most pedestrian injuries involve drivers in cars and SUVs; trucks and buses trail far behind in the count <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pace-is-not-slowing>The pace is not slowing</h3><p>Measured year to date, crashes in this district are up <strong>8.0%</strong> from last year.

The line keeps climbing <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Speed is the lever that moves the body count. As the State Senate has said, “<strong>Speed cameras have cut speeding by over 60% in locations where installed</strong>.” The tool works where we put it to work <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/senate-protects-new-york-students-and-pedestrians>NYS Senate</a>.</p><h3 id=who-holds-the-wrench>Who holds the wrench</h3><p>Council Member Nantasha M. Williams has voted to clear abandoned cars from sightlines and crosswalks, a small but real fix (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857-2024</a>). She also backed dooring warnings in taxis (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0193-2024</a>).</p><p>But the centerline remains speed. The Council can set safer defaults. The state can rein in repeat speeders. Williams now sponsors a bill to crack down on unlicensed commuter vans (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347-2025</a>). The deadliest harm, though, still comes from drivers going too fast for human bodies to survive <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=what-will-stop-the-next-siren>What will stop the next siren</h3><p>Start where the bodies fall: daylight corners on Jamaica Avenue and Farmers Boulevard; give pedestrians head starts; harden turns; route trucks off neighborhood streets. Then finish the job citywide: lower the default speed and fit habitual speeders with electronic limiters. These are the tools we have <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> — and the steps our own advocates lay out <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</p><p>One boy bled at Hillside and Parsons. It does not end there. It ends when we slow the cars and keep them slow <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Take one step now.

The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city." The agency says it incorporated feedback from 90% of local businesses.
