Thirteen people have died since 2022. Over 3,300 have been injured. Twenty-seven were hurt so badly the city calls them serious injuries. These are not numbers. They are lives cut, bodies broken, families left with empty chairs.</p><p>Just last week, a BMW on the Belt Parkway lost control, hit the median, and went airborne. Two people died. A survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;They went airborne and into the barrier.&rdquo; The car caught fire. Others were thrown from the wreck. There was no time to scream. There was only the sound of metal and glass.</p><p>On July 11, an MTA bus in Queens <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>jumped the curb and smashed into a pole</a>. Eight people were hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; Video later showed he had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. One rider <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>recalled</a>, &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb&mldr; I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>Children, elders, and the working poor are most at risk. In the last twelve months, 102 people under 18 were injured. One child was seriously hurt. Two people over 75 have died. The most common killers are cars and SUVs, responsible for over 500 injuries and seven serious injuries. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Bikes and mopeds are a fraction, but every crash is a wound.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has backed bills to study safer street designs, boost pedestrian lighting, and crack down on illegal parking. She voted to legalize jaywalking, a move that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ends the blame game against people on foot</a>. She co-sponsored a bill to create a task force on e-bike safety, but the bill sits in committee, its promise unkept. Williams was absent for a key vote to redesign truck routes and daylight intersections—measures proven to save lives.</p><p>The city moves slow. The street moves fast.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Williams. Demand action. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner, real protection for every child, every elder, every cyclist. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
