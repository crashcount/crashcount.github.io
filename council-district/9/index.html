Blood on the curb. In District 9, the violence does not stop. Three people have died on these streets in the last year. One was a three-year-old girl, struck by an SUV while crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. Her mother was hurt beside her. The numbers do not soften: 583 injured, 12 seriously, in the past twelve months (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><h2 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead are not numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. SUVs and cars do most of the killing and maiming—three deaths, eight serious injuries, 393 crashes. Trucks and buses follow. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the toll is not the same. The city’s own data shows the pattern: the bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><h2 id=what-salaam-has-doneand-whats-missing>What Salaam Has Done—And What’s Missing</h2><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam has signed on to bills that matter. He backed the law that legalized jaywalking and ended the old blame game against pedestrians (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>jaywalking law</a>). He co-sponsored a push for protected bike lanes and supported a bill to force the city to build real barriers, not just paint (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/08/us-news/lincoln-tunnel-closed-for-an-hour-in-rush-hour-nightmare-as-car-fire-snarls-traffic/>protected bike lanes</a>). He voted for greener medians and more speed humps near parks (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/us-news/nyc-straphanger-fatally-struck-by-manhattan-subway-train/>greener medians</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/02/two-men-fatally-struck-trains-separate-manhattan-subway-stations/>speed humps</a>). He joined the call to curb repeat speeders with tech that would keep them from killing again (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>curb repeat speeders</a>).</p><p>But the blood still runs. No law yet has forced the city to drop the speed limit to 20 mph. No bill has ended the reign of the repeat reckless driver. The work is not done.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p>Three dead in a year. Hundreds hurt. This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Salaam. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person on foot or bike.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;When regular people band together and demand safer streets, speed limits get lowered, laws get passed, streets get redesigned, and lives are saved.&rdquo; (<a href="https://ny.familiesforsafestreets.org/about#:~:text=In%20our%20very%20first%20year%2C,speed%20limit%20to%2025%20mph">Families for Safe Streets</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.

Commissioner Tisch told the Council, "Pass e-bike regulations." Cyclists object to criminal charges for minor violations, arguing for civil penalties instead. The article highlights the case of Renee Baruch, hospitalized after an e-bike crash left her with facial fractures and a spinal injury. The NYPD’s new Quality of Life Division targets reckless e-bike use, but without updated laws, criminal summonses remain their only tool. The policy gap leaves vulnerable road users exposed and enforcement inconsistent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors said Jiraud, on parole and wearing a GPS anklet, attacked Agudela after 11:30 p.m., stole her e-bike, and discarded it in the East River. Agudela is not expected to survive, having undergone multiple brain surgeries. The article quotes Agudela’s daughter: “We need more protection, we need more lights.” The path where the attack occurred lacked lighting and surveillance.

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He claims police issue red-light summonses to cyclists who cross intersections with the white pedestrian walk signal, despite a 2019 law permitting this. The article quotes Transportation Alternatives: “That 5-7 second head start can mean the difference between being hit by a turning car and being seen by a turning car.” Esparza says officers ignore the rule, issuing criminal summonses instead of traffic tickets.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
