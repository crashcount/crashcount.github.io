A 66-year-old man, killed on 5th Avenue. A cyclist, crushed by a bus on Lenox. In the last twelve months, three people died and eleven were seriously injured on District 9 streets. Over 600 hurt. The youngest victim was three. The oldest, seventy-four. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>SUVs and cars killed the most. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, bikes—they all left bodies behind. In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed three, trucks one. Cyclists and pedestrians are the ones who die. The street does not care if you are careful. It only cares if you are fast, heavy, and behind the wheel.</p><h2 id=what-salaam-has-doneand-not-done>What Salaam Has Done—And Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam has co-sponsored bills for protected bike lanes, speed humps, and safer crossings. He backed a resolution to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters, saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple: it&rsquo;s to save lives&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/30/council-member-yusef-salaam-throws-support-behind-albany-push-to-rein-in-speeding-drivers>supported the Albany push</a>). He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He withdrew support from a bill to register e-bikes, after hearing it would hurt immigrant workers and do nothing for safety (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/12/two-council-members-abandon-e-bike-registration-bill-after-divisive-hearing>abandoned the e-bike registration bill</a>).</p><p>But the carnage continues. No law has slowed the cars enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of being shut off. The street waits for the next siren.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected bike lanes. Demand the city keep speed cameras on. Join with others. Do not wait for another child’s name on a poster.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, now pending, would let courts require drivers with six or more automated speeding tickets in a year to install speed limiter devices. Salaam’s resolution, co-sponsored by five council members, urges Albany to act. The matter title: 'Council Member Yusef Salaam Throws Support Behind Albany Push To Rein In Speeding Drivers.' Salaam said, 'It's very simple: it's to save lives.' The hearing drew families of crash victims and advocates like Amy Cohen and Darnell Sealy-McCrorey, who lost loved ones to reckless drivers. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and other officials back the measure. Salaam’s leadership signals growing momentum for the first bill of its kind in the country.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
