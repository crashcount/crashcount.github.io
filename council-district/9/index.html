Her mother was hurt beside her. The numbers do not soften: <strong>Eight people are dead, fifty seriously injured, and over 2,300 hurt in District 9 since 2022</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The pain is not abstract. <strong>A 66-year-old man died on 5th Avenue, hit by a car while walking outside the crosswalk</strong>.
