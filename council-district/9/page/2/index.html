Her mother was hurt beside her. The numbers do not soften: <strong>Eight people are dead, fifty seriously injured, and over 2,300 hurt in District 9 since 2022</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The pain is not abstract. <strong>A 66-year-old man died on 5th Avenue, hit by a car while walking outside the crosswalk</strong>. A 59-year-old cyclist was crushed by a bus at Lenox and 138th. The city’s most vulnerable—children, elders, people on foot and bike—pay the price for every delay, every excuse, every inch given to speed and steel.</p><h3 id=the-dangers-multiply>The Dangers Multiply</h3><p>The carnage does not come from nowhere. <strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most harm: 3 deaths, 8 serious injuries, and over 400 crashes</strong>. Trucks and buses killed and maimed. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are in the mix, but the deadliest force is always the largest vehicle (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The news does not let up. <strong>A food cart broke loose from a van and slammed into a parked car with a woman and child inside</strong>. Firefighters found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline in the van. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers</a>.</p><h3 id=council-member-salaam-progress-and-the-gaps>Council Member Salaam: Progress and the Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam has voted for bills to clear abandoned vehicles, require taxi dooring warnings, and boost pavement markings. He sponsored a pilot for high-visibility crosswalks and backed speed humps near parks. He co-sponsored a resolution to curb repeat speeders. But the crisis is not over. <strong>The city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. Protected bike lanes and safe crossings lag behind the death toll.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken.</strong> Call Council Member Salaam. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and crossings where people have died. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in blood.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life."

The impact threw him into the path of a red delivery truck, which ran him over. Police said Smaragdis suffered severe head trauma and died at Bellevue Hospital. The article notes, 'The man who died after being doored while riding an e-bike and then run over by a passing truck...was a popular and influential synthwave artist.' The crash highlights the ongoing danger of dooring and the lethal consequences when street design and driver actions fail to protect cyclists. No mention of charges or policy changes followed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
