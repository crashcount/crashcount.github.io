Blood on the curb. In District 9, the violence does not stop. Three people have died on these streets in the last year. One was a three-year-old girl, struck by an SUV while crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. Her mother was hurt beside her. The numbers do not soften: 583 injured, 12 seriously, in the past twelve months (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><h2 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead are not numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. SUVs and cars do most of the killing and maiming—three deaths, eight serious injuries, 393 crashes. Trucks and buses follow. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the toll is not the same. The city’s own data shows the pattern: the bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><h2 id=what-salaam-has-doneand-whats-missing>What Salaam Has Done—And What’s Missing</h2><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam has signed on to bills that matter. He backed the law that legalized jaywalking and ended the old blame game against pedestrians (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>jaywalking law</a>). He co-sponsored a push for protected bike lanes and supported a bill to force the city to build real barriers, not just paint (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/08/us-news/lincoln-tunnel-closed-for-an-hour-in-rush-hour-nightmare-as-car-fire-snarls-traffic/>protected bike lanes</a>). He voted for greener medians and more speed humps near parks (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/us-news/nyc-straphanger-fatally-struck-by-manhattan-subway-train/>greener medians</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/02/two-men-fatally-struck-trains-separate-manhattan-subway-stations/>speed humps</a>). He joined the call to curb repeat speeders with tech that would keep them from killing again (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>curb repeat speeders</a>).</p><p>But the blood still runs. No law yet has forced the city to drop the speed limit to 20 mph. No bill has ended the reign of the repeat reckless driver. The work is not done.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p>Three dead in a year. Hundreds hurt. This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Salaam. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person on foot or bike.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;When regular people band together and demand safer streets, speed limits get lowered, laws get passed, streets get redesigned, and lives are saved.&rdquo; (<a href="https://ny.familiesforsafestreets.org/about#:~:text=In%20our%20very%20first%20year%2C,speed%20limit%20to%2025%20mph">Families for Safe Streets</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.

Patrick Hendry of the Police Benevolent Association claimed officers "lost sight of the car and did not know it crashed," but the family's attorney, Jeremy Feigenbaum, said their investigation "has not corroborated the officers' claim."

The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation to amend the vehicle and traffic law to permit a motor vehicle’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to be listed in a Notice of Violation, instead of license plate number, in circumstances when a license plate of such vehicle is missing, concealed, obscured, or distorted.' Council Members Chris Banks (primary sponsor, District 42) and Yusef Salaam (co-sponsor, District 9) back the bill. The law now demands a plate number on tickets, letting violators escape if plates are unreadable.

The article states, “A wrong-way driver fleeing from police struck a bicyclist in Greenwich Village during a chase.” The suspect, pursued on foot by officers, entered a black sedan and hit the cyclist before escaping. Emergency services brought the 44-year-old victim to Bellevue Hospital; he survived. The suspect remains at large. The piece notes a sharp rise in injuries from police pursuits: 398 crashes and 315 injuries in the first eleven months of 2024, up 47% from the previous year. The NYPD is revising its pursuit policy after ten deaths in cases where “no drugs or guns were found.”</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.
