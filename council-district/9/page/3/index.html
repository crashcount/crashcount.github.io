A 66-year-old man, killed on 5th Avenue. A cyclist, crushed by a bus on Lenox. In the last twelve months, three people died and eleven were seriously injured on District 9 streets. Over 600 hurt. The youngest victim was three. The oldest, seventy-four. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>SUVs and cars killed the most. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, bikes—they all left bodies behind. In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed three, trucks one. Cyclists and pedestrians are the ones who die. The street does not care if you are careful. It only cares if you are fast, heavy, and behind the wheel.</p><h2 id=what-salaam-has-doneand-not-done>What Salaam Has Done—And Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam has co-sponsored bills for protected bike lanes, speed humps, and safer crossings. He backed a resolution to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters, saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple: it&rsquo;s to save lives&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/30/council-member-yusef-salaam-throws-support-behind-albany-push-to-rein-in-speeding-drivers>supported the Albany push</a>). He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He withdrew support from a bill to register e-bikes, after hearing it would hurt immigrant workers and do nothing for safety (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/12/two-council-members-abandon-e-bike-registration-bill-after-divisive-hearing>abandoned the e-bike registration bill</a>).</p><p>But the carnage continues. No law has slowed the cars enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of being shut off. The street waits for the next siren.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected bike lanes. Demand the city keep speed cameras on. Join with others. Do not wait for another child’s name on a poster.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

Introduced May 16, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to install pedestrian lighting on at least 25 step streets each year. The bill’s matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends.
