Blood on the curb. In District 9, the violence does not stop. Three people have died on these streets in the last year. One was a three-year-old girl, struck by an SUV while crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. Her mother was hurt beside her. The numbers do not soften: 583 injured, 12 seriously, in the past twelve months (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><h2 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead are not numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. SUVs and cars do most of the killing and maiming—three deaths, eight serious injuries, 393 crashes. Trucks and buses follow. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the toll is not the same. The city’s own data shows the pattern: the bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><h2 id=what-salaam-has-doneand-whats-missing>What Salaam Has Done—And What’s Missing</h2><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam has signed on to bills that matter. He backed the law that legalized jaywalking and ended the old blame game against pedestrians (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>jaywalking law</a>). He co-sponsored a push for protected bike lanes and supported a bill to force the city to build real barriers, not just paint (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/08/us-news/lincoln-tunnel-closed-for-an-hour-in-rush-hour-nightmare-as-car-fire-snarls-traffic/>protected bike lanes</a>). He voted for greener medians and more speed humps near parks (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/us-news/nyc-straphanger-fatally-struck-by-manhattan-subway-train/>greener medians</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/02/two-men-fatally-struck-trains-separate-manhattan-subway-stations/>speed humps</a>). He joined the call to curb repeat speeders with tech that would keep them from killing again (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>curb repeat speeders</a>).</p><p>But the blood still runs. No law yet has forced the city to drop the speed limit to 20 mph. No bill has ended the reign of the repeat reckless driver. The work is not done.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p>Three dead in a year. Hundreds hurt. This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Salaam. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person on foot or bike.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;When regular people band together and demand safer streets, speed limits get lowered, laws get passed, streets get redesigned, and lives are saved.&rdquo; (<a href="https://ny.familiesforsafestreets.org/about#:~:text=In%20our%20very%20first%20year%2C,speed%20limit%20to%2025%20mph">Families for Safe Streets</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report lists the contributing factors for both the driver and the pedestrian as 'Unspecified.' No driver errors are explicitly cited in the report. The narrative describes the aftermath: 'His head split open. Blood ran. He stayed awake. The street kept moving.' The report does not mention any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor.

The incident occurred early in the morning when the motorcycle, traveling south, lost control on slippery pavement and collided head-on with a southbound SUV. The police report lists 'Pavement Slippery' as a contributing factor. The rider, who was helmeted, was ejected from the motorcycle and suffered severe head trauma, resulting in apparent death at the scene. The motorcycle was described as 'demolished,' and blood was visible on the road. Both vehicles sustained front-end damage. No driver errors such as speeding or failure to yield are cited in the report, but the hazardous road surface is explicitly noted. The victim's helmet use is mentioned in the police report after the primary contributing factor of the slick pavement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
