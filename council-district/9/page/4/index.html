The vehicle's center front bumper struck a 33-year-old man who was crossing the intersection with the signal. The impact crushed the pedestrian’s hip and upper leg, leaving him injured but conscious. The report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor for the crash. The pedestrian’s action—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the driver’s failure to yield. The sedan sustained no damage, but the man suffered severe crush injuries. The incident underscores the persistent danger faced by those on foot when drivers disregard the right-of-way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
