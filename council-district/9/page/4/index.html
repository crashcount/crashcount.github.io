Her mother was hurt beside her. The numbers do not soften: <strong>Eight people are dead, fifty seriously injured, and over 2,300 hurt in District 9 since 2022</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The pain is not abstract. <strong>A 66-year-old man died on 5th Avenue, hit by a car while walking outside the crosswalk</strong>. A 59-year-old cyclist was crushed by a bus at Lenox and 138th. The city’s most vulnerable—children, elders, people on foot and bike—pay the price for every delay, every excuse, every inch given to speed and steel.</p><h3 id=the-dangers-multiply>The Dangers Multiply</h3><p>The carnage does not come from nowhere. <strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most harm: 3 deaths, 8 serious injuries, and over 400 crashes</strong>. Trucks and buses killed and maimed. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are in the mix, but the deadliest force is always the largest vehicle (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The news does not let up. <strong>A food cart broke loose from a van and slammed into a parked car with a woman and child inside</strong>. Firefighters found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline in the van. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers</a>.</p><h3 id=council-member-salaam-progress-and-the-gaps>Council Member Salaam: Progress and the Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam has voted for bills to clear abandoned vehicles, require taxi dooring warnings, and boost pavement markings. He sponsored a pilot for high-visibility crosswalks and backed speed humps near parks. He co-sponsored a resolution to curb repeat speeders. But the crisis is not over. <strong>The city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. Protected bike lanes and safe crossings lag behind the death toll.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken.</strong> Call Council Member Salaam. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and crossings where people have died. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in blood.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
