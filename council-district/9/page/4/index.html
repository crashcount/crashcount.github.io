Blood on the curb. In District 9, the violence does not stop. Three people have died on these streets in the last year. One was a three-year-old girl, struck by an SUV while crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. Her mother was hurt beside her. The numbers do not soften: 583 injured, 12 seriously, in the past twelve months (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><h2 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead are not numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. SUVs and cars do most of the killing and maiming—three deaths, eight serious injuries, 393 crashes. Trucks and buses follow. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the toll is not the same. The city’s own data shows the pattern: the bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><h2 id=what-salaam-has-doneand-whats-missing>What Salaam Has Done—And What’s Missing</h2><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam has signed on to bills that matter. He backed the law that legalized jaywalking and ended the old blame game against pedestrians (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>jaywalking law</a>). He co-sponsored a push for protected bike lanes and supported a bill to force the city to build real barriers, not just paint (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/08/us-news/lincoln-tunnel-closed-for-an-hour-in-rush-hour-nightmare-as-car-fire-snarls-traffic/>protected bike lanes</a>). He voted for greener medians and more speed humps near parks (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/us-news/nyc-straphanger-fatally-struck-by-manhattan-subway-train/>greener medians</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/02/two-men-fatally-struck-trains-separate-manhattan-subway-stations/>speed humps</a>). He joined the call to curb repeat speeders with tech that would keep them from killing again (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>curb repeat speeders</a>).</p><p>But the blood still runs. No law yet has forced the city to drop the speed limit to 20 mph. No bill has ended the reign of the repeat reckless driver. The work is not done.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p>Three dead in a year. Hundreds hurt. This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Salaam. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person on foot or bike.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;When regular people band together and demand safer streets, speed limits get lowered, laws get passed, streets get redesigned, and lives are saved.&rdquo; (<a href="https://ny.familiesforsafestreets.org/about#:~:text=In%20our%20very%20first%20year%2C,speed%20limit%20to%2025%20mph">Families for Safe Streets</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.
