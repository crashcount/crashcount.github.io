Pedestrians and cyclists took much of the hit. SUVs and cars did most of the harm. These aren’t numbers. They’re wounds. They’re our streets.</p><h3 id=bqe-lie-queens-blvd-the-killing-corridors>BQE, LIE, Queens Blvd: the killing corridors</h3><p>The worst pain clusters on the highways and the big arterial. The <a href=#>Brooklyn‑Queens Expressway</a> leads with 386 injuries and at least two deaths, followed by the <a href=#>Long Island Expressway</a> with 372 injuries and at least one death, and <a href=#>Queens Boulevard</a> with three deaths and 163 injuries, according to the district roll‑up of top sites. Heavy metal, high speed, human bodies.</p><p>On Nov. 21, 2024, the BQE saw a four‑vehicle pileup that killed a 75‑year‑old passenger and injured an 8‑year‑old girl and a 46‑year‑old driver, per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash records for CrashID 4773163</a>. Four vehicles. Trucks in the mix. Westbound. Morning commute. One seat went empty that night.</p><h3 id=midday-and-dusk-dont-spare-anyone>Midday and dusk don’t spare anyone</h3><p>The district’s worst hours are not only late night. Deaths crest at 4 a.m., 10 a.m., 2–6 p.m., and 5–10 p.m., with injuries piling up through the afternoon commute, per the hourly distribution in city data. The 5 p.m. hour shows 230 injuries with two deaths; 6 p.m. adds another two deaths and 215 injuries. Daylight or dark, the danger stays on.</p><h3 id=people-on-foot-and-bike-keep-paying>People on foot and bike keep paying</h3><p>Since 2022, drivers killed five pedestrians and two cyclists here; 497 pedestrians and 463 cyclists were injured, per the district mode split. Trucks and buses dealt fewer total blows than cars, but when trucks turn, the margin for error vanishes.</p><p>On July 18, 2024, a box truck turning right at Greenpoint Ave and 43rd St struck and killed a 28‑year‑old bicyclist, city record <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4741425</a> shows. The driver’s truck hit with the right front bumper while the cyclist traveled straight. Failure to yield is listed. “Driver Inattention/Distraction” is listed. The helmet didn’t matter.</p><p>On June 26, 2024, a 16‑year‑old girl was killed at 47th Ave and 46th St while a driver made a left, with “View Obstructed/Limited” marked in the report (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4735938</a>). She never saw the car. The car never saw her. The corner stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-corner-you-cant-see-can-kill-you>The corner you can’t see can kill you</h3><p>Intersections are where most pedestrians fall. The Council says blocking sight lines is part of it. Council Member Julie Won backed a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of all crosswalks and to install barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. “Daylighting saves lives,” advocates argued as the bill advanced (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>Streetsblog coverage</a>; <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file Int 1138-2024</a>).</p><h3 id=agencies-looked-away-cars-took-the-greenway>Agencies looked away, cars took the greenway</h3><p>In Long Island City, residents begged the city to keep cars off the Queensbridge Baby Greenway. Won’s office pushed Parks for bollards and fencing. The NYPD and Parks pointed at each other. “Council Member Won fully supports the call for the Parks Department to install fencing and bollards,” her chief of staff said (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/29/can-we-just-keep-cars-off-the-greenway>Streetsblog</a>). The path meant for people became a lot for cars. That’s not a crash. It’s the weather system that brings the crash.</p><h3 id=what-the-numbers-say-about-blame-and-cause>What the numbers say about blame and cause</h3><p>In this district, the biggest bucket is “other,” tied to 7 deaths and 821 injuries. But we also see failure to yield, disregarding traffic control, improper turns, inattention. None of it brings anyone back. It does show how to stop the next one. Harden turns. Clear corners. Give walkers a head start. Protect bike lanes. Keep trucks out of tight turns. Target repeat hotspots like <a href=#>Queens Boulevard</a> and <a href=#>Northern Boulevard</a> where injuries and deaths stack up in the city ledger.</p><h3 id=citywide-fixes-that-would-matter-here>Citywide fixes that would matter here</h3><ul><li>Lower speeds. A pedestrian hit at 20 mph lives more often than one hit at 30. New York has the power now. Advocates are calling for a citywide 20 mph default under Sammy’s Law. The case is laid out here: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>Stop the worst repeat offenders. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force chronic violators to install speed limiters. The data on repeat speeders is stark; see the call to pass it: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=a-note-from-a-prosecutor-about-terror-on-a-highway>A note from a prosecutor about terror on a highway</h3><p>When a Bayside man drove the wrong way on the Clearview and smashed five cars, Queens DA Melinda Katz said he “terrorized other drivers” and noted two motorists “were badly hurt and still have not fully recovered,” as reported by <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>. That was outside this district. The fear she named rides with people here every day.</p><h3 id=what-to-fix-first-on-our-blocks>What to fix first on our blocks</h3><ul><li>Daylight the blind corners. Won has pushed it. Pass it and build it at scale (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>Streetsblog</a>; <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>).</li><li>Harden right and left turns at Greenpoint/43rd and 47th/46th. Protect the bike line across Greenpoint Ave. Truck‑safe geometry, not paint.</li><li>Block car access on the Queensbridge Baby Greenway, as demanded in March 2024 (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/29/can-we-just-keep-cars-off-the-greenway>Streetsblog</a>).</li></ul><p>The list of names is longer than this story. The fixes are shorter. Do one today. Then another tomorrow.</p><p>Act now: push the city to slow the streets and rein in repeat speeders.

The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive.

The move targets deadly blind spots. Advocates demand faster action. DOT lags behind. Intersections remain killing grounds for children and pedestrians. The city stalls. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On December 6, 2024, Council Member Julie Won (D-Queens) introduced a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of all intersections citywide—a measure known as daylighting. The bill, now before the City Council, would require the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The matter summary states: 'Parking right up against intersections blocks sight lines for pedestrians and drivers, leading to people to have to peak out into the street to see oncoming traffic.' Won said, 'Daylighting saves lives.' Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans back the bill, citing slow DOT progress and urgent need. Intersections account for 55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries, according to DOT. The bill follows a year of tragic child deaths and mounting public pressure for universal daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
