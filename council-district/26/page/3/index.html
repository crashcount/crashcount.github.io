Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On December 6, 2024, Council Member Julie Won (D-Queens) introduced a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of all intersections citywide—a measure known as daylighting. The bill, now before the City Council, would require the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The matter summary states: 'Parking right up against intersections blocks sight lines for pedestrians and drivers, leading to people to have to peak out into the street to see oncoming traffic.' Won said, 'Daylighting saves lives.' Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans back the bill, citing slow DOT progress and urgent need. Intersections account for 55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries, according to DOT. The bill follows a year of tragic child deaths and mounting public pressure for universal daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill was introduced December 5, 2024, with Council Member Gale A. Brewer as primary sponsor and Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Julie Won, Julie Menin, Shekar Krishnan, Farah N. Louis, Chi A. Ossé, Nantasha M. Williams, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Carlina Rivera, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams as co-sponsors. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law in relation to the establishment of a task force to study options for making street design and infrastructure safer in consideration of increased use of electric bicycles and related collisions.' The committee laid the bill over on December 11, 2024. The task force, if created, must deliver recommendations for legislation and policy within 270 days. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, e-bike riders—remain at risk while the city studies its next move.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The moped rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the driver errors. The Tesla’s left front bumper collided with the moped’s right front, sending the rider to the pavement. The police report’s language—'Steel struck flesh. A 26-year-old man crumpled to the pavement, leg crushed'—underscores the brutal impact and the dangers faced by vulnerable road users when drivers fail to yield or pay attention.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Years of delays left walkers and cyclists squeezed, colliding daily. City leaders promise a safer crossing by summer’s end. Motorists keep four lanes. Vulnerable users finally get space.</p><p class=mb3>On July 30, 2024, the Department of Transportation (DOT) began construction to convert the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway into a pedestrian-only lane. The project, first promised in 2017 and announced by former Mayor Bill de Blasio for completion in 2022, faced years of delays. Council Member Julie Won stated, “After years of delays, broken promises, and missed deadlines, construction...has finally begun.” The DOT’s plan aims to separate nearly 3,000 daily pedestrians and 7,000 cyclists, who have long shared a cramped, dangerous path. Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives said, “The city has been on notice for years about this problem and it is their responsibility to provide a safe facility for walking and biking.” Crashes and injuries continued as the city prioritized car traffic, keeping the lane open to drivers during bridge rehab. The new pedestrian path, with added fencing and sidewalk extensions, promises overdue safety for those on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
