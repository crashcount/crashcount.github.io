Ten more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, District 26 has seen 1,552 crashes. Nearly a thousand neighbors have been hurt. The dead include a 16-year-old girl, a 75-year-old man, a child under 18, and a man in his forties. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>A seven-year-old girl lay on the sidewalk outside her school, her femur snapped, her head bloodied. An unlicensed driver lost control and plowed into her and two others. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>reported</a> that &ldquo;an out-of-control unlicensed driver rammed into two kids and one adult,&rdquo; leaving the child broken. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license.</p><p>A 94-year-old woman was pinned under a USPS van as she crossed Broadway. She was in the crosswalk. The van drove over her. She survived, barely. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/10/us-news/usps-van-strikes-woman-94-and-pins-her-underneath-vehicle-on-nyc-street-police/>said</a>, &ldquo;The van drove completely over the woman, who fell to the ground when hit, before coming to an abrupt stop with the victim trapped under it.&rdquo; No charges were filed.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h3><p><strong>Council Member Julie Won has backed key safety bills.</strong> She co-sponsored the universal daylighting bill to ban parking near crosswalks, a move to clear sightlines and save lives. She supported the SAFE Streets Act, the Queens Boulevard redesign, and the push for protected bike lanes. She joined calls to open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path and voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable instead of the reckless.</p><p>But the pace is slow. Promised projects stall. The bridge path remains closed to walkers and cyclists. The city delays, and people keep dying. Won <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/19/stuck-at-dot-queensboro-pedestrian-path-delayed-again-this-time-until-winter>warned</a>, &ldquo;DOT once again is choosing &mldr; drivers over pedestrians,&rdquo; and said the delay &ldquo;will continue to endanger the nearly 10,000 pedestrians and cyclists who use the narrow shared path every day.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not abstract. It is a mother screaming on the sidewalk. It is a child in a cast.</strong></p><p><strong>Contact Julie Won. Demand faster action.</strong> Demand the city open the Queensboro Bridge path, build more protected bike lanes, and pass daylighting at every intersection. Call for lower speed limits and real enforcement. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not wait.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Introduced March 19, 2024, the bill would require the Department of Transportation to paint and install overhead school safety signs on every street with a school entrance. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing safety signs near schools.' Council Member Susan Zhuang leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Gennaro, Won, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Louis, Cabán, Restler, Farías, Banks, and Riley as co-sponsors. The bill aims to alert drivers to the presence of school-aged children and pedestrians. It remains in committee, with no vote or enactment date set. The measure targets a simple truth: children cross streets, drivers often do not see them. Signs alone will not stop cars, but they mark danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states he was 'unlicensed and bareheaded,' and that he was ejected from the vehicle, suffering fatal head injuries. The narrative describes the victim as slamming 'headfirst' and dying alone on the pavement. Police records indicate the driver had no license and wore no safety equipment. The vehicle sustained damage to the center front end, consistent with a high-impact collision. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor, but the data makes clear the driver was unlicensed and not wearing a helmet. No other vehicles or persons were involved. The crash underscores the lethal risk of unlicensed operation and lack of protective equipment, as documented in the official report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
