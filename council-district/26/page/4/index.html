In the last twelve months, 591 people were injured in traffic crashes. Four suffered serious injuries. Not one was spared by age or circumstance. Children, elders, workers, and riders—no one walks away untouched. There were no deaths, but the wounds run deep. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>injury data</a></p><p>Just last month, a man was crushed by an SUV while crossing at Greenpoint Avenue and 45th Street. The driver was distracted. The pedestrian was left unconscious, his body broken. The street was busy. The city moved on. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>collision record</a></p><p>A cyclist, 45, was struck by an SUV making a U-turn on Skillman Avenue. He suffered crush injuries to his leg. The driver kept her license. The rider kept the scars. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable><strong>The System Fails the Vulnerable</strong></h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. In the last year, cars and trucks injured 67 people walking or biking. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt two more. Even bikes caused three injuries. The numbers are small, but the pain is not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle injury stats</a></p><p>A mother on the bus in Flushing said, &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said a bus passenger</a>. But caution is not enough. The sidewalk is no refuge. Eight people were hurt when an MTA bus jumped the curb and slammed into a pole. The driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>bus crash report</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay><strong>Leadership: Progress and Delay</strong></h3><p>Council Member Julie Won has backed bills to clear sightlines at intersections, speed up pavement markings, and remove abandoned cars. She co-sponsored the universal daylighting bill to ban parking near crosswalks—&ldquo;Daylighting saves lives,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>she said</a>. She voted to force the city to repaint crosswalks within five days of street work. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>crosswalk repainting legislation</a>. She supports barriers to keep cars off the Queensbridge Baby Greenway. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/29/can-we-just-keep-cars-off-the-greenway>greenway protection</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The city still lets cars park up to the edge of crosswalks. The greenway is still a parking lot. The sidewalk is still a danger zone. Every delay is another body in the street.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-change><strong>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Change</strong></h3><p>Call Council Member Julie Won. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every crosswalk be cleared. Demand action, not excuses.</p><p>No more waiting. No more names turned to numbers. The violence will not stop until we force it to stop. <a href=/take_action/>take action</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The vehicle's rear bumper struck a 46-year-old man who was standing off the roadway. The report states the pedestrian suffered severe bleeding to his lower leg and foot but remained conscious at the scene. The primary contributing factor listed is 'Brakes Defective.' The taxi was backing up at the time of the crash. No driver errors beyond the mechanical failure are cited in the report. The pedestrian was not in the roadway and is not listed as contributing to the collision.

The matter, described as 'lawlessness on the greenway,' has seen police ignore months of resident complaints. Won, through Chief of Staff Nick Gulotta, demanded the Parks Department install fencing and bollards to block cars. 'Council Member Won fully supports the call for the Parks Department to install fencing and bollards to prevent cars from illegally parking and driving through the Queensbridge Baby Park Greenway,' Gulotta said. The Parks Department claims to be working on a 'barricade plan' with NYCHA, but offers no timeline. The greenway, once a haven for pedestrians and cyclists, now serves as a parking lot. The NYPD and Parks Department pass blame. Vulnerable road users remain exposed. The system fails to protect them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states he was 'unlicensed and bareheaded,' and that he was ejected from the vehicle, suffering fatal head injuries. The narrative describes the victim as slamming 'headfirst' and dying alone on the pavement. Police records indicate the driver had no license and wore no safety equipment. The vehicle sustained damage to the center front end, consistent with a high-impact collision. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor, but the data makes clear the driver was unlicensed and not wearing a helmet. No other vehicles or persons were involved.
