Forty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 3,400 hurt since 2022. The dead include children, cyclists, elders. The living carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just last month, a 16-year-old girl was killed crossing at 46th Street and 47th Avenue. Her body was crushed. The driver made a left turn. She never made it home. A 28-year-old woman on an e-bike was struck and killed by a box truck on Greenpoint Avenue. She was ejected. Her helmet did not save her. The street did not save her. These are not isolated tragedies. They are the pattern.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed or injured hundreds of pedestrians and cyclists.

The city moves on.</p><h3 id=council-member-julie-won-action-and-silence>Council Member Julie Won: Action and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Julie Won has backed some measures that matter.

She has pushed for more protected bike lanes and solar crosswalks. But the work is not done. The streets are not safe. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call Council Member Won. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand universal daylighting at every intersection. Demand action that saves lives, not words that fill the air. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill is titled, "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing child with autism warning plaques on streets." Council Member Kevin C. Riley is the primary sponsor, joined by Ariola, Joseph, Moya, Won, Banks, Narcisse, Paladino, and Marmorato. Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children. The city continues to rely on signage, not street redesign, to address systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law requires the Department of Transportation to consult with the Fire Department before approving open street applications, bicycle lane projects, or major transportation projects. The official matter title states the law amends the city code to require DOT to consult with FDNY and notify affected firehouses before moving forward. Primary sponsor Kalman Yeger, with co-sponsors including Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, Lynn Schulman, and others, pushed the bill through. The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes. No safety analyst assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users. The law’s effect: more agencies weigh in, but the process for safer streets grows longer and more complex.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On December 6, 2024, Council Member Julie Won (D-Queens) introduced a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of all intersections citywide—a measure known as daylighting. The bill, now before the City Council, would require the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The matter summary states: 'Parking right up against intersections blocks sight lines for pedestrians and drivers, leading to people to have to peak out into the street to see oncoming traffic.' Won said, 'Daylighting saves lives.' Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans back the bill, citing slow DOT progress and urgent need. Intersections account for 55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries, according to DOT. The bill follows a year of tragic child deaths and mounting public pressure for universal daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
