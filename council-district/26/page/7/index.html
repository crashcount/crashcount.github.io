The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The injuries are not just bruises. They are broken bones, crushed skulls, lives changed in a blink.</p><p>Just last year, a 16-year-old girl was killed at an intersection on 47th Avenue. She never made it across. In another crash, a cyclist was crushed by a turning truck on Greenpoint Avenue. The data shows the pattern: <strong>cars, trucks, and SUVs do most of the killing</strong>. The city calls them accidents. But the pain is not accidental. It is built into the street.</p><h3 id=daylighting-saves-livesbut-progress-crawls>&ldquo;Daylighting Saves Lives&rdquo;—But Progress Crawls</h3><p>Council Member Julie Won has taken some steps. She backed a bill to ban parking near intersections, a move known as daylighting. &ldquo;Daylighting saves lives,&rdquo; she said, pushing to clear sight lines so drivers can see children and elders before it is too late (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>Streetsblog NYC</a>). She also voted to speed up pavement markings and to clear abandoned cars from crosswalks—small steps, but steps all the same (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The city promises a thousand intersections a year. There are tens of thousands. <strong>Every week that passes, another life is risked.</strong></p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>After a bus jumped the curb in Flushing, injuring eight, a passenger said, &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York</a>). But caution is not enough. The system puts the burden on the vulnerable. The driver had fallen asleep at the wheel (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>). The city shrugs. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Residents must demand more. Call Council Member Julie Won. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand universal daylighting at every intersection. Demand that the city redesign streets for people, not cars. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the road.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

One flipped. Metal screamed. A 21-year-old man bled from his arm, half-ejected. Two others hurt. Speed drove the chaos. The road did not forgive. The city counted the wounded.</p><p class=mb3>Seven vehicles collided eastbound on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. According to the police report, 'Seven cars collided. One flipped. Metal shrieked. A 21-year-old man, half-thrown from his seat, bled from his arm. He stayed awake. Speed was the cause. Speed, again.' Three people were injured: a 21-year-old male driver suffered severe bleeding and partial ejection; a 28-year-old female front passenger and a 53-year-old female driver both reported pain and nausea. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for both primary vehicles. No other driver errors or helmet or signal issues were cited. The crash left twisted metal and pain in its wake.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
