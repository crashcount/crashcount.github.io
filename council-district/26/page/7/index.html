That is all. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-pedestrians-1-driver-killed-when-car-slams-into-food-truck-in-queens/>CBS New York</a>.</p><p>“A hit‑and‑run driver killed a 52‑year‑old man… The driver sped off without stopping,” police said near JFK. “No arrests have been made.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>NY Daily News</a> and <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a> confirmed the time and place.

He told police he went the wrong way “because I wanted to hurt people.” A judge gave him eight years.

Pedestrians suffered 496 injuries and five deaths. Cyclists, 460 injuries and two deaths. The hour‑by‑hour table shows the danger building after dark and before dawn. “Other” causes dominate the city forms, but neglect has a shape: turns that cut, blocked sight lines, and drivers who do not see what is right in front of them.</p><h3 id=fix-what-is-in-plain-sight>Fix what is in plain sight</h3><p>Sight lines kill here. The Council member for this district backed a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and to build daylighting barriers at 1,000 corners a year. “Daylighting saves lives,” a supporter said when the bill was introduced. Read it in <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>Streetsblog</a> and the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file</a> for Int 1138‑2024.</p><p>Markings matter. The Council passed a law to force fast striping after milling so crossings and lanes are visible within five business days. See <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1160‑2025</a>. Won voted yes. Clearing junk cars helps too; she backed a law to remove derelicts within 72 hours so corners and crosswalks are not blind. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857‑2024</a>.</p><p>On the ground, corners like Queens Boulevard and Northern Boulevard need hardened turns and no‑parking daylighting now. Truck routes through Greenpoint Avenue and Skillman need slow entries and protected corners. Night hours need focused enforcement where the deaths stack up.</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-that-cut-the-body-count>Citywide tools that cut the body count</h3><p>Albany handed New York City the power to lower its own speed limits. The city can drop residential streets to 20 mph. That saves lives. Use it. See our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> explainer.</p><p>A small share of drivers does outsized harm. “1.5% of motorists cause 21% of pedestrian deaths,” and vehicles with 16 camera tickets in a year are far more likely to kill. The proposed Stop Super Speeders Act would force those drivers to use speed‑limiting tech. Read the figures and call script in our <a href=/take_action/>action page</a>, with sourcing to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog’s analysis</a>.</p><p>Lower the speeds. Stop the repeat offenders. Protect the crossing. The rest is names we will not get back.</p><p>—</p><p>Bold steps save lives. Start with one: <strong>tell City Hall to set 20 mph on residential streets and back speed limiters for repeat offenders</strong>.
