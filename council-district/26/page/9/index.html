Since 2022, <strong>20 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>Forty-two more suffered serious injuries</strong>. Most were walking, biking, or riding. In the last year alone, three lives ended. Nine hundred thirty-one people were hurt. The numbers do not stop. They do not care if you are young or old. A 16-year-old girl, a 75-year-old man, a 28-year-old cyclist—all gone.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> SUVs, sedans, and taxis together killed four and injured hundreds. Trucks and buses added more pain. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the deadliest wounds came from the biggest machines.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes>The Latest Crashes</h3><p>The news does not rest. In June, a cyclist was killed in Astoria, hit by a driver fleeing police. Surveillance video showed Amanda Servedio &ldquo;went flying off her bicycle and slammed into a parked BMW while <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/23/us-news/nyc-man-charged-in-fatal-hit-and-run-while-fleeing-burglary/>the driver sped off</a>.&rdquo; The chase lasted ten minutes. The street was crowded. Amanda Servedio was coming home from a ride. She never made it.</p><p>Days later, a scooter rider died at an intersection. &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left&mldr; it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling [the rider] off the device,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>police told amNY</a>. The body count rises. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-has-julie-won-done>What Has Julie Won Done?</h3><p>Council Member Julie Won has backed some of the right bills. She co-sponsored the law to <strong>ban parking near crosswalks</strong>—daylighting—meant to clear sightlines and save lives. &ldquo;Daylighting saves lives,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>Won said</a>. She voted to <strong>legalize jaywalking</strong>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop drivers from killing. She pushed for <strong>protected bike lanes</strong> and <strong>lower speed limits</strong>. She demanded the city open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path, warning that delay &ldquo;will continue to endanger the nearly 10,000 pedestrians and cyclists who use the narrow shared path every day&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/19/stuck-at-dot-queensboro-pedestrian-path-delayed-again-this-time-until-winter>as reported by Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not enough. The pace is too slow. The city celebrates small wins while families bury their dead.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Won.

Emergencies at non-NYCHA properties could override this order, with required notification to local officials. The bill required DOT to report on completed and pending NYCHA sidewalk repairs by June 30, 2023.

The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without enactment.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) delayed the conversion of the South Outer Roadway to a full-time pedestrian path until at least the end of 2023, citing ongoing bridge repairs. The shared path, only 11 feet wide, is far below DOT’s own safety standards. Injuries have increased as usage soars—nine cyclists hurt in three years, up from three. Julie Won said, "People walking or biking on the shared path are paying with bloody pavement and broken bones, all so the DOT can promote car travel for the few." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the project is a priority, but the city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed. Nine lanes for cars, half a lane each for people.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.
