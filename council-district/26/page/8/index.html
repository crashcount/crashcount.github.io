Forty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 3,400 hurt since 2022. The dead include children, cyclists, elders. The living carry scars and limp through crosswalks where the paint has faded. The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a <strong>16-year-old girl was killed at a Sunnyside intersection</strong>. The cause: a left-turning sedan, sightlines blocked. She never made it across <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>the street</a>. On Greenpoint Avenue, a <strong>28-year-old woman on a bike was crushed by a turning box truck</strong>. She wore a helmet. It did not matter. The truck kept going. She did not.</p><h3 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h3><p>The pain is not silent. After a crash on the Belt Parkway, a survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>described</a> how &ldquo;they went airborne and into the barrier.&rdquo; The car burned. Two died. Others crawled out through shattered glass. On a city bus struck by a crane, a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>recalled</a> &ldquo;I was holding on for my life back there.&rdquo; Four were hurt. The fear lingers long after the sirens fade.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Julie Won has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking</strong>. She co-sponsored the universal daylighting bill, stating that <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>&ldquo;Daylighting saves lives.&rdquo;</a> She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. But the pace is slow. The city still allows cars to park up to the edge of crosswalks. Trucks still turn across bike lanes. The blood dries, but the danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Won. Demand she fight for a citywide 20 mph speed limit, for protected intersections, for real enforcement against reckless drivers—not just cyclists and walkers. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Contact your council member and demand action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
