Since 2022, <strong>20 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>Forty-two more suffered serious injuries</strong>. Most were walking, biking, or riding. In the last year alone, three lives ended. Nine hundred thirty-one people were hurt. The numbers do not stop. They do not care if you are young or old. A 16-year-old girl, a 75-year-old man, a 28-year-old cyclist—all gone.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> SUVs, sedans, and taxis together killed four and injured hundreds. Trucks and buses added more pain. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the deadliest wounds came from the biggest machines.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes>The Latest Crashes</h3><p>The news does not rest. In June, a cyclist was killed in Astoria, hit by a driver fleeing police. Surveillance video showed Amanda Servedio &ldquo;went flying off her bicycle and slammed into a parked BMW while <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/23/us-news/nyc-man-charged-in-fatal-hit-and-run-while-fleeing-burglary/>the driver sped off</a>.&rdquo; The chase lasted ten minutes. The street was crowded. Amanda Servedio was coming home from a ride. She never made it.</p><p>Days later, a scooter rider died at an intersection. &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left&mldr; it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling [the rider] off the device,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>police told amNY</a>. The body count rises. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-has-julie-won-done>What Has Julie Won Done?</h3><p>Council Member Julie Won has backed some of the right bills. She co-sponsored the law to <strong>ban parking near crosswalks</strong>—daylighting—meant to clear sightlines and save lives. &ldquo;Daylighting saves lives,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>Won said</a>. She voted to <strong>legalize jaywalking</strong>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop drivers from killing. She pushed for <strong>protected bike lanes</strong> and <strong>lower speed limits</strong>. She demanded the city open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path, warning that delay &ldquo;will continue to endanger the nearly 10,000 pedestrians and cyclists who use the narrow shared path every day&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/19/stuck-at-dot-queensboro-pedestrian-path-delayed-again-this-time-until-winter>as reported by Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not enough. The pace is too slow. The city celebrates small wins while families bury their dead.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Won.

Riders and pedestrians squeeze into a single lane. Car lanes stay open. Bike trips surge. Crashes rise. Advocates and Council Member Julie Won demand action. City puts drivers first, safety last.</p><p class=mb3>On December 5, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) delayed expanding pedestrian and cyclist space on the Queensboro Bridge. The plan, promised by former Mayor Bill de Blasio, would have made the southern roadway pedestrian-only and the northern path bike-only by the end of 2022. Instead, DOT postponed this until at least late 2023, citing the need to keep seven of nine car lanes open during bridge rehabilitation. The matter summary states: 'The city is delaying the expansion of space for cyclists and pedestrians on the Queensboro Bridge, despite a significant increase in bike traffic.' Council Member Julie Won criticized the move, saying, 'The city must open the south outer roadway immediately for our safety. DOT should stop prioritizing cars over the safety of pedestrians.' Advocates point to rising bike ridership and crashes on the narrow shared path. DOT maintains the project cannot be expedited due to driver needs, despite evidence that more bike infrastructure boosts usage without hurting traffic elsewhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight moves to City Planning.</p><p class=mb3>On November 7, 2022, Queens Community Board 2 passed a resolution rejecting a rezoning application for a Lincoln SUV dealership on Northern Boulevard, Woodside. The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
