Ten more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, District 26 has seen 1,552 crashes. Nearly a thousand neighbors have been hurt. The dead include a 16-year-old girl, a 75-year-old man, a child under 18, and a man in his forties. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>A seven-year-old girl lay on the sidewalk outside her school, her femur snapped, her head bloodied. An unlicensed driver lost control and plowed into her and two others. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>reported</a> that &ldquo;an out-of-control unlicensed driver rammed into two kids and one adult,&rdquo; leaving the child broken. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license.</p><p>A 94-year-old woman was pinned under a USPS van as she crossed Broadway. She was in the crosswalk. The van drove over her. She survived, barely. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/10/us-news/usps-van-strikes-woman-94-and-pins-her-underneath-vehicle-on-nyc-street-police/>said</a>, &ldquo;The van drove completely over the woman, who fell to the ground when hit, before coming to an abrupt stop with the victim trapped under it.&rdquo; No charges were filed.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h3><p><strong>Council Member Julie Won has backed key safety bills.</strong> She co-sponsored the universal daylighting bill to ban parking near crosswalks, a move to clear sightlines and save lives. She supported the SAFE Streets Act, the Queens Boulevard redesign, and the push for protected bike lanes. She joined calls to open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path and voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable instead of the reckless.</p><p>But the pace is slow. Promised projects stall. The bridge path remains closed to walkers and cyclists. The city delays, and people keep dying. Won <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/19/stuck-at-dot-queensboro-pedestrian-path-delayed-again-this-time-until-winter>warned</a>, &ldquo;DOT once again is choosing &mldr; drivers over pedestrians,&rdquo; and said the delay &ldquo;will continue to endanger the nearly 10,000 pedestrians and cyclists who use the narrow shared path every day.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not abstract. It is a mother screaming on the sidewalk. It is a child in a cast.</strong></p><p><strong>Contact Julie Won. Demand faster action.</strong> Demand the city open the Queensboro Bridge path, build more protected bike lanes, and pass daylighting at every intersection. Call for lower speed limits and real enforcement. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not wait.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The agency scaled back busway hours on Jamaica Avenue and 181st Street after local pushback. Council Member Oswald Feliz opposed Fordham Road improvements, calling them an 'existential threat.'

The plan, promised by former Mayor Bill de Blasio, would have made the southern roadway pedestrian-only and the northern path bike-only by the end of 2022. Instead, DOT postponed this until at least late 2023, citing the need to keep seven of nine car lanes open during bridge rehabilitation. The matter summary states: 'The city is delaying the expansion of space for cyclists and pedestrians on the Queensboro Bridge, despite a significant increase in bike traffic.' Council Member Julie Won criticized the move, saying, 'The city must open the south outer roadway immediately for our safety. DOT should stop prioritizing cars over the safety of pedestrians.' Advocates point to rising bike ridership and crashes on the narrow shared path. DOT maintains the project cannot be expedited due to driver needs, despite evidence that more bike infrastructure boosts usage without hurting traffic elsewhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible.

The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
