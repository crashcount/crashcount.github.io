Eleven seriously hurt. Over a thousand injured.</strong> That is the price paid in District 26 in the past year alone. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A 16-year-old girl, struck and killed at an intersection on 47th Avenue. A 36-year-old woman, thrown from her bike and left dead on 34th Avenue. A 28-year-old cyclist, crushed by a turning truck on Greenpoint Avenue. The street remembers every name, even if the city forgets.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-streets-built-for-speed-not-safety>The Pattern: Streets Built for Speed, Not Safety</h3><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, and cars do the most harm.</strong> In this district, cars and trucks caused four deaths and 386 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists in the last three years (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The danger is not random. Intersections are blind. Speed is unchecked. The city’s own data shows that more than half of pedestrian deaths happen at crossings. Still, the curb is crowded with parked cars, blocking every view. The city calls it daylighting. The people call it survival.</p><h3 id=the-response-council-member-julie-wons-record>The Response: Council Member Julie Won’s Record</h3><p>Council Member Julie Won has backed bills to clear sightlines at intersections, co-sponsoring a ban on parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>&ldquo;Daylighting saves lives,&rdquo;</a> she said, pushing for barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. She also supported the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act</a>, demanding lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The streets do not wait for new laws.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Council Member Won. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand universal daylighting at every corner. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0549-2023, filed at session’s end, came from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced April 11, 2023, and pushed by Council Member Shahana K. Hanif as primary sponsor, with Jennifer Gutiérrez and over twenty others co-sponsoring. The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ ... and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' The SAFE Streets Act package also includes safe passing for cyclists and complete street design mandates. The Council’s action highlights the city’s ongoing fight against reckless driving and the urgent need for stronger protections for people on foot, on bikes, and in cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
