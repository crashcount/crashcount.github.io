Since 2022, <strong>20 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>Forty-two more suffered serious injuries</strong>. Most were walking, biking, or riding. In the last year alone, three lives ended. Nine hundred thirty-one people were hurt. The numbers do not stop. They do not care if you are young or old. A 16-year-old girl, a 75-year-old man, a 28-year-old cyclist—all gone.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> SUVs, sedans, and taxis together killed four and injured hundreds. Trucks and buses added more pain. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the deadliest wounds came from the biggest machines.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes>The Latest Crashes</h3><p>The news does not rest. In June, a cyclist was killed in Astoria, hit by a driver fleeing police. Surveillance video showed Amanda Servedio &ldquo;went flying off her bicycle and slammed into a parked BMW while <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/23/us-news/nyc-man-charged-in-fatal-hit-and-run-while-fleeing-burglary/>the driver sped off</a>.&rdquo; The chase lasted ten minutes. The street was crowded. Amanda Servedio was coming home from a ride. She never made it.</p><p>Days later, a scooter rider died at an intersection. &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left&mldr; it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling [the rider] off the device,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>police told amNY</a>. The body count rises. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-has-julie-won-done>What Has Julie Won Done?</h3><p>Council Member Julie Won has backed some of the right bills. She co-sponsored the law to <strong>ban parking near crosswalks</strong>—daylighting—meant to clear sightlines and save lives. &ldquo;Daylighting saves lives,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>Won said</a>. She voted to <strong>legalize jaywalking</strong>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop drivers from killing. She pushed for <strong>protected bike lanes</strong> and <strong>lower speed limits</strong>. She demanded the city open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path, warning that delay &ldquo;will continue to endanger the nearly 10,000 pedestrians and cyclists who use the narrow shared path every day&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/19/stuck-at-dot-queensboro-pedestrian-path-delayed-again-this-time-until-winter>as reported by Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not enough. The pace is too slow. The city celebrates small wins while families bury their dead.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Won.

The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024.

Won met with Parks and pushed for a solution, but declined to say if she supports a continuous protected bike lane on Vernon Boulevard. The matter summary: 'The Parks Department reopened the greenway path through Queensbridge Park less than 48 hours after Streetsblog reported the abrupt, unexplained closure of a crucial cycling route.' Cyclists and advocates welcomed the reopening but criticized the lack of notice and the ongoing gap in protected bike infrastructure. Won is also working with DOT and NYCHA to install more barriers in nearby parks.

Cyclists and walkers remain crammed together. Council Member Julie Won called out the danger. DOT blames supply chain woes. Lives hang in the balance while cars keep their lanes.</p><p class=mb3>On May 23, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced at a City Council hearing that the dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge would be delayed until at least mid-2024. This is the fourth delay for the project, which was originally promised by the end of 2022. The matter, discussed in the Council, centers on transforming the south outer roadway from a car lane into a pedestrian path, giving cyclists sole access to the north outer roadway. Council Member Julie Won (D-Astoria) expressed frustration, stating, 'It was announced that it would be open in 2022 ... and last year you said that it may be 2024. You now have a delayed update again.' Won highlighted the life-and-death risk for vulnerable users forced to share a narrow, overcrowded path. DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione cited supply chain issues, especially with paint, as the reason for the delay, but refused to cede a car lane, citing traffic concerns. Advocacy group Bike New York's Jon Orcutt urged the city to test weekend closures for cars. The delay keeps pedestrians and cyclists in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
