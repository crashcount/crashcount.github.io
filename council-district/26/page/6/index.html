Ten more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, District 26 has seen 1,552 crashes. Nearly a thousand neighbors have been hurt. The dead include a 16-year-old girl, a 75-year-old man, a child under 18, and a man in his forties. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>A seven-year-old girl lay on the sidewalk outside her school, her femur snapped, her head bloodied. An unlicensed driver lost control and plowed into her and two others. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>reported</a> that &ldquo;an out-of-control unlicensed driver rammed into two kids and one adult,&rdquo; leaving the child broken. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license.</p><p>A 94-year-old woman was pinned under a USPS van as she crossed Broadway. She was in the crosswalk. The van drove over her. She survived, barely. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/10/us-news/usps-van-strikes-woman-94-and-pins-her-underneath-vehicle-on-nyc-street-police/>said</a>, &ldquo;The van drove completely over the woman, who fell to the ground when hit, before coming to an abrupt stop with the victim trapped under it.&rdquo; No charges were filed.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h3><p><strong>Council Member Julie Won has backed key safety bills.</strong> She co-sponsored the universal daylighting bill to ban parking near crosswalks, a move to clear sightlines and save lives. She supported the SAFE Streets Act, the Queens Boulevard redesign, and the push for protected bike lanes. She joined calls to open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path and voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable instead of the reckless.</p><p>But the pace is slow. Promised projects stall. The bridge path remains closed to walkers and cyclists. The city delays, and people keep dying. Won <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/19/stuck-at-dot-queensboro-pedestrian-path-delayed-again-this-time-until-winter>warned</a>, &ldquo;DOT once again is choosing &mldr; drivers over pedestrians,&rdquo; and said the delay &ldquo;will continue to endanger the nearly 10,000 pedestrians and cyclists who use the narrow shared path every day.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not abstract. It is a mother screaming on the sidewalk. It is a child in a cast.</strong></p><p><strong>Contact Julie Won. Demand faster action.</strong> Demand the city open the Queensboro Bridge path, build more protected bike lanes, and pass daylighting at every intersection. Call for lower speed limits and real enforcement. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not wait.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez blamed inaccurate timelines from the previous administration and ongoing upper deck reconstruction. Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton said, 'We feel very committed to turn that south outer roadway into the pedestrian path,' but insisted the deck work must finish first. Council Member Julie Won, voicing frustration, declared, 'It is unacceptable that DOT continues delaying the timeline.' She demanded the city stop prioritizing cars over pedestrians and open the path by the end of 2023 as promised. The delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed, with Won warning, 'Every delay means more serious injuries from traffic violence.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
