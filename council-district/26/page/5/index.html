Ten more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, District 26 has seen 1,552 crashes. Nearly a thousand neighbors have been hurt. The dead include a 16-year-old girl, a 75-year-old man, a child under 18, and a man in his forties. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>A seven-year-old girl lay on the sidewalk outside her school, her femur snapped, her head bloodied. An unlicensed driver lost control and plowed into her and two others. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>reported</a> that &ldquo;an out-of-control unlicensed driver rammed into two kids and one adult,&rdquo; leaving the child broken. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license.</p><p>A 94-year-old woman was pinned under a USPS van as she crossed Broadway. She was in the crosswalk. The van drove over her. She survived, barely. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/10/us-news/usps-van-strikes-woman-94-and-pins-her-underneath-vehicle-on-nyc-street-police/>said</a>, &ldquo;The van drove completely over the woman, who fell to the ground when hit, before coming to an abrupt stop with the victim trapped under it.&rdquo; No charges were filed.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h3><p><strong>Council Member Julie Won has backed key safety bills.</strong> She co-sponsored the universal daylighting bill to ban parking near crosswalks, a move to clear sightlines and save lives. She supported the SAFE Streets Act, the Queens Boulevard redesign, and the push for protected bike lanes. She joined calls to open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path and voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable instead of the reckless.</p><p>But the pace is slow. Promised projects stall. The bridge path remains closed to walkers and cyclists. The city delays, and people keep dying. Won <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/19/stuck-at-dot-queensboro-pedestrian-path-delayed-again-this-time-until-winter>warned</a>, &ldquo;DOT once again is choosing &mldr; drivers over pedestrians,&rdquo; and said the delay &ldquo;will continue to endanger the nearly 10,000 pedestrians and cyclists who use the narrow shared path every day.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not abstract. It is a mother screaming on the sidewalk. It is a child in a cast.</strong></p><p><strong>Contact Julie Won. Demand faster action.</strong> Demand the city open the Queensboro Bridge path, build more protected bike lanes, and pass daylighting at every intersection. Call for lower speed limits and real enforcement. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not wait.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash involved a sedan and two SUVs, all traveling east. The report lists 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor. No other driver errors are specified. The 23-year-old woman was ejected and killed. The 22-year-old front passenger suffered crush injuries but survived. The police report does not list helmet or signal use as factors. The toll: one life lost, another scarred, and a road marked by reckless speed and alcohol.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024.

Won met with Parks and pushed for a solution, but declined to say if she supports a continuous protected bike lane on Vernon Boulevard. The matter summary: 'The Parks Department reopened the greenway path through Queensbridge Park less than 48 hours after Streetsblog reported the abrupt, unexplained closure of a crucial cycling route.' Cyclists and advocates welcomed the reopening but criticized the lack of notice and the ongoing gap in protected bike infrastructure. Won is also working with DOT and NYCHA to install more barriers in nearby parks.

Cyclists and walkers remain crammed together. Council Member Julie Won called out the danger. DOT blames supply chain woes. Lives hang in the balance while cars keep their lanes.</p><p class=mb3>On May 23, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced at a City Council hearing that the dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge would be delayed until at least mid-2024. This is the fourth delay for the project, which was originally promised by the end of 2022. The matter, discussed in the Council, centers on transforming the south outer roadway from a car lane into a pedestrian path, giving cyclists sole access to the north outer roadway. Council Member Julie Won (D-Astoria) expressed frustration, stating, 'It was announced that it would be open in 2022 ... and last year you said that it may be 2024. You now have a delayed update again.' Won highlighted the life-and-death risk for vulnerable users forced to share a narrow, overcrowded path. DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione cited supply chain issues, especially with paint, as the reason for the delay, but refused to cede a car lane, citing traffic concerns. Advocacy group Bike New York's Jon Orcutt urged the city to test weekend closures for cars. The delay keeps pedestrians and cyclists in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
