The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The injuries are not just bruises. They are broken bones, crushed skulls, lives changed in a blink.</p><p>Just last year, a 16-year-old girl was killed at an intersection on 47th Avenue. She never made it across. In another crash, a cyclist was crushed by a turning truck on Greenpoint Avenue. The data shows the pattern: <strong>cars, trucks, and SUVs do most of the killing</strong>. The city calls them accidents. But the pain is not accidental. It is built into the street.</p><h3 id=daylighting-saves-livesbut-progress-crawls>&ldquo;Daylighting Saves Lives&rdquo;—But Progress Crawls</h3><p>Council Member Julie Won has taken some steps. She backed a bill to ban parking near intersections, a move known as daylighting. &ldquo;Daylighting saves lives,&rdquo; she said, pushing to clear sight lines so drivers can see children and elders before it is too late (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>Streetsblog NYC</a>). She also voted to speed up pavement markings and to clear abandoned cars from crosswalks—small steps, but steps all the same (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The city promises a thousand intersections a year. There are tens of thousands. <strong>Every week that passes, another life is risked.</strong></p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>After a bus jumped the curb in Flushing, injuring eight, a passenger said, &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York</a>). But caution is not enough. The system puts the burden on the vulnerable. The driver had fallen asleep at the wheel (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>). The city shrugs. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Residents must demand more. Call Council Member Julie Won. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand universal daylighting at every intersection. Demand that the city redesign streets for people, not cars. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the road.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
