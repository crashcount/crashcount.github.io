Pedestrians and cyclists watch the curb.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0474-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 28, 2024, by Julie Won and co-sponsored by Williams, Restler, Salaam, Bottcher, Riley, Brewer, Farías, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill orders DOT to create at least one dynamic parking zone per borough, with rates rising or falling by real-time demand. DOT must set the range before launch and give a week’s notice for changes. Vehicles with special permits stay exempt. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing dynamic parking zones.' No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative states the cyclist was thrown, crushed, and killed, suffering head trauma. The police report notes the truck 'kept straight' as it struck the cyclist, who lay still after impact. The contributing factor listed by police is 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion,' but no specific driver error is cited in the data. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, as recorded in the report, but this is not listed as a contributing factor to the crash. The violence of the impact and the truck's continued path underscore the danger faced by cyclists sharing streets with large vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
