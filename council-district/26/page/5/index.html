Forty-three serious injuries. Over 6,000 crashes since 2022.</strong> The dead include children, cyclists, elders. The living carry scars. In the last year alone, three people died and eleven were left with life-changing wounds (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The pain is not abstract. On June 26, a 16-year-old girl was killed at an intersection. On July 18 last year, a 28-year-old woman riding her bike was crushed by a turning truck. The stories repeat. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The bike lane is not safe.</p><p>A bus jumps the curb in Flushing. Eight hurt. &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said Samantha Hart</a>. The driver, new on the job, may have fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation drags on (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed four, seriously injured four, and left hundreds with lesser wounds. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes also left their mark, but the carnage is driven by heavy, fast vehicles (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The city blames distraction, inattention, bad luck. But the pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—pay the highest price. &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said Jacqueline Cox</a>. The devastation is not rare. It is routine.</p><h3 id=council-member-julie-won-action-and-delay>Council Member Julie Won: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Julie Won has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>Streetsblog NYC</a>). She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and pushed for more daylight at intersections (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). These are steps in the right direction. But the pace is slow. The bills sit in committee. The deaths do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-relentless-change>The Next Step: Demand Relentless Change</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. These are not accidents.</strong> Every crash is a policy failure. Call Council Member Julie Won. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings, daylighted corners, and real enforcement against reckless drivers. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. Inside the taxi, a 49-year-old woman seated in the right rear position suffered severe facial lacerations and was found semiconscious, her lap belt and harness holding her in place. The narrative states, 'A taxi turned left. An SUV struck its side. Metal shrieked. In the back seat, a woman’s face split open. Blood pooled on the floor. She faded, semiconscious, her belt holding what the crash could not.' The violence of the impact and the cited driver inattention underscore the systemic dangers faced by passengers in New York City traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations," creates a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 2,640 feet of a school. The penalty is $175 per violation. The Department of Transportation must launch a civilian reporting program. If DOT prosecutes a case using civilian evidence, the complainant gets 25% of the proceeds. Council Member Carlina Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Joseph, Menin, Nurse, Hudson, Brannan, Farías, Brewer, Salaam, Hanif, Avilés, Won, Bottcher, Krishnan, Gutiérrez, Marte, and the Brooklyn Borough President.
