The plan, discussed at a community board meeting, would have barred cyclists from Beach 108th to Beach 73rd Street during summer months. Council Member Joann Ariola, representing District 32, expressed relief at the reversal, stating, 'I’m glad that the Parks Department is going to continue allowing Rockaway residents to enjoy their bikes on the boardwalk this summer, but now we need real enforcement.' Instead of a ban, the Parks Department will increase signage and enforcement, especially near concessions. The community board voted 30-1 for new signs and called for marked bike lanes, an 8 mph speed limit, and clearer right-of-way rules.

Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Jennifer Gutiérrez and a long list of co-sponsors. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law orders all taxis and for-hire vehicles to post warning decals on rear passenger doors, alerting riders to check for cyclists before opening. The Taxi and Limousine Commission will provide the signs at no cost. The measure targets dooring, a common threat to cyclists.
