Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year alone, District 32’s streets have not been safe. The numbers do not lie: 1,029 people hurt, 15 left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, neighbors. They are the young and the old—children, elders, and everyone in between.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a 22-year-old woman was ejected and killed on the Belt Parkway.</strong> Days before, a 39-year-old motorcyclist died on Jackie Robinson Parkway. Two men, 31 and 67, were struck and killed on Atlantic Avenue. The list goes on. The blood dries, but the pain lingers.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h2><p>Council Member Joann Ariola has acted, but not always for the most vulnerable. She voted to clear abandoned vehicles from the streets—<strong>a step toward safer crossings</strong> (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She co-sponsored a bill to require bike-share companies to display safety rules, but this does nothing to slow cars or protect children in crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).</p><p>But when it mattered most, Ariola voted against expanding speed cameras in school zones. She said, “these cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,” even as her own SUV racked up <strong>27 school-zone speeding tickets</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The cameras work. They slow cars. They save lives. The children do not get a vote.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-what-will-it-take>The Road Ahead: What Will It Take?</h2><p><strong>Speed is still the killer.</strong> Most deaths come from cars and SUVs. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not used it.

The plan, once a bold vision for a car-free, walkable neighborhood, was gutted after pressure from local politicians like Assembly Member Ed Braunstein and Council Member Joann Ariola. The original proposal called for 2,775 homes and limited parking. Now, density drops by 27 percent. Empire State Development claims compromise, but the statement is aspirational and lacks concrete safety measures for pedestrians or cyclists. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.

He died at Jamaica Hospital.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (2025-08-01), a 23-year-old man died after being run over on 101st Street and Liberty Boulevard in Queens. The article reports, "Sonalall approached the driver's side window and flashed what appeared to be a gun, startling the motorist, who then drove off, striking Sonalall." The Queens District Attorney's Office did not charge the driver, citing fear for his life. The incident highlights the lethal risk when vehicles are used in moments of conflict.
