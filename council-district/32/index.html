Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five dead, twelve more with wounds that will not heal. <strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children—no one is spared.</strong></p><p>On Woodhaven Boulevard, a 23-year-old woman tried to cross the street. A motorcycle hit her. She died at the hospital. The police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>&ldquo;A 23-year-old woman died after a motorcycle rider ran over her as she was crossing the street in Queens early Friday morning.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No answers. Only another family left with a hole that never closes.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, three men stepped out of a car. A van driver lost control. One man, 31, died. The others survived. The police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Victim Zhihong Shi was exiting a double parked car with the two other victims near the corner of 87th St. and Atlantic Ave. in Woodhaven around 10:30 a.m. Friday when the driver of a passing Ford Econoline van lost control of his wheel.&rdquo;</a> The street stayed open. The risk stayed the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Joann Ariola has taken some steps. She backed bills for better lighting on city stairways and for raised speed bumps at camera locations. She voted to require DOT to collect micromobility data and to redesign truck routes. These are small moves in the right direction.</p><p>But <strong>when it mattered most, Ariola stood in the way</strong>. She voted against expanding speed cameras to 24/7, a proven way to slow drivers and save lives. She opposed legalizing safe street crossings, keeping jaywalking penalties that blame the victim. She pushed for more red tape before the city can repurpose parking for safer uses. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>&ldquo;These cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,&rdquo; she argued, even as her own car racked up dozens of speeding tickets.</a></p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against proven safety, means more names on the list. <strong>Advocates must act.</strong> Call Ariola. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras, not fewer. Demand streets that put people first, not parking. Do not wait for another name to be added to the roll call of the dead.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Joann Ariola welcomed the reversal but demanded tougher enforcement against reckless cyclists. Locals pushed for clearer signs and marked lanes. The board voted for new safety measures.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2025, a proposed ban on bicycles along Rockaway Beach’s boardwalk was canceled after public backlash. The plan, discussed at a community board meeting, would have barred cyclists from Beach 108th to Beach 73rd Street during summer months. Council Member Joann Ariola, representing District 32, expressed relief at the reversal, stating, 'I’m glad that the Parks Department is going to continue allowing Rockaway residents to enjoy their bikes on the boardwalk this summer, but now we need real enforcement.' Instead of a ban, the Parks Department will increase signage and enforcement, especially near concessions. The community board voted 30-1 for new signs and called for marked bike lanes, an 8 mph speed limit, and clearer right-of-way rules. Board chair Dolores Orr stressed these safety improvements have been needed since the boardwalk’s post-Sandy rebuild.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law aims for more eyes, more voices, but adds hurdles for street redesigns.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 0104-2024, now Local Law 6 of 2025, was enacted by the City Council on January 18, 2025, after passing both the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the full Council in December 2024. The law requires the Department of Transportation to consult with the Fire Department before approving open street applications, bicycle lane projects, or major transportation projects. The official matter title states the law amends the city code to require DOT to consult with FDNY and notify affected firehouses before moving forward. Primary sponsor Kalman Yeger, with co-sponsors including Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, Lynn Schulman, and others, pushed the bill through. The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes. No safety analyst assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users. The law’s effect: more agencies weigh in, but the process for safer streets grows longer and more complex.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say it slows life-saving street redesigns. Advocates warn it props up car culture and blocks safer bike lanes. The bill risks more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 103, now before the City Council, would require the Department of Transportation to notify Council members every time a single parking spot is repurposed—for car-share, bike corrals, or Citi Bike docks. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The truck’s right front bumper struck a 64-year-old woman who was crossing the street. She suffered a head injury with severe bleeding but remained conscious at the scene. The report notes the vehicle was an 'Oversized Vehicle,' listing this as a contributing factor. The pickup showed no visible damage after the collision.
