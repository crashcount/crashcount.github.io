But she voted <strong>no</strong> on daylighting, a proven fix that clears sightlines at corners. She voted <strong>no</strong> on legalizing jaywalking, keeping a law that targets the vulnerable and lets drivers off the hook. When the Council moved to set 5 mph limits on Open Streets, she voted <strong>no</strong> again. On speed cameras, Ariola once voted against expansion, even as her own car racked up <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>27 school-zone speeding tickets</a>.

According to the police report, the crash occurred during a police pursuit. The report states the driver was 'Backing Unsafely' and did not possess a valid license. The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk at the time, but the report does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The narrative describes the scene: 'A fleeing Honda reversed into a man, not at a crosswalk. His leg was crushed under steel. He stayed conscious. The driver had no license. The streetlights flickered. Sirens followed.' The focus remains on the driver’s unlawful actions—operating without a license and reversing unsafely while fleeing police—which directly led to the pedestrian’s injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
