Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five dead, twelve more with wounds that will not heal. <strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children—no one is spared.</strong></p><p>On Woodhaven Boulevard, a 23-year-old woman tried to cross the street. A motorcycle hit her. She died at the hospital. The police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>&ldquo;A 23-year-old woman died after a motorcycle rider ran over her as she was crossing the street in Queens early Friday morning.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No answers. Only another family left with a hole that never closes.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, three men stepped out of a car. A van driver lost control. One man, 31, died. The others survived. The police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Victim Zhihong Shi was exiting a double parked car with the two other victims near the corner of 87th St. and Atlantic Ave. in Woodhaven around 10:30 a.m. Friday when the driver of a passing Ford Econoline van lost control of his wheel.&rdquo;</a> The street stayed open. The risk stayed the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Joann Ariola has taken some steps. She backed bills for better lighting on city stairways and for raised speed bumps at camera locations. She voted to require DOT to collect micromobility data and to redesign truck routes. These are small moves in the right direction.</p><p>But <strong>when it mattered most, Ariola stood in the way</strong>. She voted against expanding speed cameras to 24/7, a proven way to slow drivers and save lives. She opposed legalizing safe street crossings, keeping jaywalking penalties that blame the victim. She pushed for more red tape before the city can repurpose parking for safer uses. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>&ldquo;These cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,&rdquo; she argued, even as her own car racked up dozens of speeding tickets.</a></p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against proven safety, means more names on the list. <strong>Advocates must act.</strong> Call Ariola. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras, not fewer. Demand streets that put people first, not parking. Do not wait for another name to be added to the roll call of the dead.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Introduced February 28, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to assess at least 100 speed camera locations each year for raised speed reducer feasibility. The bill reads: 'requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), David M. Carr, Sandra Ung, Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, and Vickie Paladino sponsor the measure. If DOT finds a location suitable, it must install a raised speed reducer within a year.

The streetlights flickered. Sirens followed.' The focus remains on the driver’s unlawful actions—operating without a license and reversing unsafely while fleeing police—which directly led to the pedestrian’s injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by Council Members Tiffany Caban and Shahana Hanif, aims to 'greenlight pedestrians to freely cross streets outside the crosswalk or without obeying traffic signals.' The bill responds to claims of biased enforcement against Black and Latino New Yorkers. Council Majority Leader Joseph Borelli and Councilwoman Joann Ariola oppose the bill, warning it could endanger pedestrians. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or received a hearing. The NYPD and Mayor's office are reviewing the legislation. The debate highlights the tension between enforcement fairness and the ongoing risk to vulnerable road users.
