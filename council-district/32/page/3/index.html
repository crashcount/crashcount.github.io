People on foot and bike take the hit. In three years, District 32 logged <strong>24 deaths and 3,095 injuries</strong> in 4,731 crashes. Pedestrians paid most: <strong>13 killed, 379 hurt</strong>. Cyclists weren’t spared: <strong>1 killed, 178 hurt</strong>. The numbers come from city data and cover 2022 through August 25, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The worst corridors are known. <strong><a href=#>Belt Parkway</a></strong> took four lives. <strong><a href=#>Woodhaven Boulevard</a></strong> took four. <strong><a href=#>Cross Bay Boulevard</a></strong> took two. <strong><a href=#>Jackie Robinson Parkway</a></strong> topped the list for injuries and deaths with three. Nights cut deeper. Crashes piled up from <strong>8 p.m. to 1 a.m.</strong>, with deadly hits at 20:00, 21:00, and 23:00 hours, and heavy injuries through midnight (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Unsafe speed shows up again and again in fatal files on these roads (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4769296</a>).</p><p>Wrong-way. Hit-and-run. Bodies ejected on the parkway. The clips are blunt. A Queens driver went wrong-way on the Clearview in 2023 and smashed into five cars. A jury convicted him. He told police he felt “liberated” after entering the highway to hurt people. The DA said he “terrorized other drivers.” He got eight years (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>). A <strong>52‑year‑old man</strong> crossing near JFK at 155th and South Conduit was hit and left to die at 2:30 a.m. “The operator of the vehicle fled the scene,” police said. No arrests (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>NY Daily News</a>). Two men ordering food in Queens were also struck and killed by a speeding car; the driver died too (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-pedestrians-1-driver-killed-when-car-slams-into-food-truck-in-queens/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=belt-and-woodhaven-keep-taking>Belt and Woodhaven keep taking</h3><p>On the <strong>Belt Parkway</strong>, fatal speed shows in the records. A 25‑year‑old driver died after a high‑speed lane change in November 2024. The file lists “Unsafe Speed.” Two late‑model cars, both eastbound, both demolished (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4769296</a>). In July 2025, two more young people were killed and two injured in another Belt crash with speed in the notes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4825307</a>).</p><p>On <strong>Woodhaven Boulevard</strong>, a 23‑year‑old woman crossing at night was struck and killed. The motorcycle file lists “Traffic Control Disregarded” and “Unsafe Speed” at the intersection by 83‑35 Woodhaven. She died there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4808010</a>). Districtwide, Woodhaven appears in the top tier for deaths and injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=nights-lights-bodies>Nights, lights, bodies</h3><p>This district bleeds after dark. From 8 p.m. to midnight, injuries stack up. Deaths spike at <strong>20:00 and 23:00</strong>. The city’s own tally shows a steady drumbeat through the night hours (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The <strong>Queens South</strong> patrol area, which includes the JFK hit‑and‑run site, had 17 traffic deaths this year through August 10, up from 13 last year, police told reporters (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Heavy vehicles are not the main killers here. Cars and SUVs are. They account for most pedestrian deaths and injuries in the district data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-leaders-didand-didnt>What leaders did—and didn’t</h3><p>Some steps are small and slow. The Council voted to force faster removal of derelict cars, clearing sightlines and corners. District 32’s member voted yes (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar Int 0857‑2024</a>). She also co‑sponsored a bill to make micromobility share operators show safety rules to riders (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar Int 1304‑2025</a>).</p><p>But on bigger levers, the record is mixed. In 2022, the Council backed 24/7 speed cameras, but seven members voted no. District 32’s member opposed expanded cameras that day, even as violations mounted on city streets (<a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>NY Post</a>; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>Streetsblog</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-the-deadly-places>Fix the deadly places</h3><p>Start where people die. Daylight corners and harden turns on <strong><a href=/neighborhood/qn0905/>Woodhaven Boulevard</a></strong> and <strong><a href=/neighborhood/qn1003/>Cross Bay Boulevard</a></strong>. Give leading walk time at major crossings. Slow the <strong><a href=/neighborhood/qn1403/>Belt Parkway</a></strong> and its service roads with speed management and targeted night enforcement. The data points to darkness; the response should, too. Focus on repeat hotspots and nighttime conditions—the known flags in this district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Then use the tools that cut speed citywide. <strong>Lower the default speed limit</strong> across the city. <strong>Require speed limiters for repeat camera offenders.</strong> These measures are on the table now. Lawmakers and advocates have already framed the path: protect 24/7 cameras, slow every street, and force the worst drivers to obey or park it. The city has the power to drop speeds; Albany is weighing devices for repeat speeders (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/18/council-members-want-to-be-notified-when-city-repurposes-their-parking>Streetsblog</a>; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/nyc-could-have-its-first-car-free-neighborhood-but-wont-get-it-due-to-revanchist-pols>Streetsblog</a>).</p><p>The names in the files are gone. The roads remain. Slow them now.</p><p>—</p><p>Want to help? Take one step. Tell City Hall to cut speeds and rein in repeat offenders.

Prosecutors allege Pena drove at 83 mph—over three times the speed limit—while drunk and high, running a red light at Northern Boulevard and 107th Street. His blood alcohol content was .156, far above the legal limit. The crash killed Justin Diaz, 23, who was driving to work. Pena had 25 prior school zone speeding tickets and was charged with manslaughter, assault, reckless driving, and more. Queens DA Melinda Katz said, “Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways.” The article highlights repeated dangerous driving and questions about how such drivers remain on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA demanded $4 billion from the city—a 33% jump from the last plan—warning of major subway disruptions if denied. The matter, titled 'MTA threatens another ‘Summer of Hell’ of subway disruptions if NYC doesn’t cough up billions,' drew sharp words. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Queens) blasted the agency: 'Instead of insulting us with baseless threats, the agency that spends $30 million on a staircase should find ways to cut its wasteful spending and bloated payroll before asking for more taxpayer money.' Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility. Despite heated criticism, council members did not strongly oppose the request in session. The hearing left the city’s most vulnerable riders—those who rely on safe, reliable transit—caught between political fights and crumbling infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
