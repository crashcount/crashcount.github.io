Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five dead, twelve more with wounds that will not heal. <strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children—no one is spared.</strong></p><p>On Woodhaven Boulevard, a 23-year-old woman tried to cross the street. A motorcycle hit her. She died at the hospital. The police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>&ldquo;A 23-year-old woman died after a motorcycle rider ran over her as she was crossing the street in Queens early Friday morning.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No answers. Only another family left with a hole that never closes.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, three men stepped out of a car. A van driver lost control. One man, 31, died. The others survived. The police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Victim Zhihong Shi was exiting a double parked car with the two other victims near the corner of 87th St. and Atlantic Ave. in Woodhaven around 10:30 a.m. Friday when the driver of a passing Ford Econoline van lost control of his wheel.&rdquo;</a> The street stayed open. The risk stayed the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Joann Ariola has taken some steps. She backed bills for better lighting on city stairways and for raised speed bumps at camera locations. She voted to require DOT to collect micromobility data and to redesign truck routes. These are small moves in the right direction.</p><p>But <strong>when it mattered most, Ariola stood in the way</strong>. She voted against expanding speed cameras to 24/7, a proven way to slow drivers and save lives. She opposed legalizing safe street crossings, keeping jaywalking penalties that blame the victim. She pushed for more red tape before the city can repurpose parking for safer uses. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>&ldquo;These cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,&rdquo; she argued, even as her own car racked up dozens of speeding tickets.</a></p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against proven safety, means more names on the list. <strong>Advocates must act.</strong> Call Ariola. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras, not fewer. Demand streets that put people first, not parking. Do not wait for another name to be added to the roll call of the dead.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states that the Chevy SUV was 'going straight ahead' when it collided with the Jeep, which was 'stopped in traffic.' The impact crumpled steel and left the 34-year-old Jeep driver with crush injuries to his entire body. He was found in shock, still strapped in his seat. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor in the crash, underscoring the danger of inattentive driving. No evidence in the report suggests any error or contributing factor on the part of the injured Jeep driver. The collision highlights the risks posed by distracted drivers to everyone on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Mayor Eric Adams backed more police and mental health interventions, while Governor Hochul's National Guard deployment drew fire.

The incident occurred as the man 'stepped from behind a parked car.' The report states the sedan was 'backing unsafely,' directly citing this driver action as a contributing factor. The narrative details, 'Steel struck skull. He fell. Blood spread on the cold street.' Despite the impact, the vehicle showed 'no damage.' The pedestrian remained conscious at the scene, his 'head torn open.' The police report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary focus remains on the unsafe reversing maneuver by the driver.

The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children.

The law requires the Department of Transportation to consult with the Fire Department before approving open street applications, bicycle lane projects, or major transportation projects. The official matter title states the law amends the city code to require DOT to consult with FDNY and notify affected firehouses before moving forward. Primary sponsor Kalman Yeger, with co-sponsors including Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, Lynn Schulman, and others, pushed the bill through. The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
