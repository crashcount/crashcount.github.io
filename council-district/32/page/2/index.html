Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year alone, District 32’s streets have not been safe. The numbers do not lie: 1,029 people hurt, 15 left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, neighbors. They are the young and the old—children, elders, and everyone in between.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a 22-year-old woman was ejected and killed on the Belt Parkway.</strong> Days before, a 39-year-old motorcyclist died on Jackie Robinson Parkway. Two men, 31 and 67, were struck and killed on Atlantic Avenue. The list goes on. The blood dries, but the pain lingers.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h2><p>Council Member Joann Ariola has acted, but not always for the most vulnerable. She voted to clear abandoned vehicles from the streets—<strong>a step toward safer crossings</strong> (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She co-sponsored a bill to require bike-share companies to display safety rules, but this does nothing to slow cars or protect children in crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).</p><p>But when it mattered most, Ariola voted against expanding speed cameras in school zones. She said, “these cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,” even as her own SUV racked up <strong>27 school-zone speeding tickets</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The cameras work. They slow cars. They save lives. The children do not get a vote.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-what-will-it-take>The Road Ahead: What Will It Take?</h2><p><strong>Speed is still the killer.</strong> Most deaths come from cars and SUVs. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. The carnage continues.</p><p><strong>“I wish they would never have given him that car—because if they didn’t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now,”</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>said Keisha Francis, whose 14-year-old was killed by an unlicensed teen driver</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not fate.

The board voted for new safety measures.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2025, a proposed ban on bicycles along Rockaway Beach’s boardwalk was canceled after public backlash. The plan, discussed at a community board meeting, would have barred cyclists from Beach 108th to Beach 73rd Street during summer months. Council Member Joann Ariola, representing District 32, expressed relief at the reversal, stating, 'I’m glad that the Parks Department is going to continue allowing Rockaway residents to enjoy their bikes on the boardwalk this summer, but now we need real enforcement.' Instead of a ban, the Parks Department will increase signage and enforcement, especially near concessions. The community board voted 30-1 for new signs and called for marked bike lanes, an 8 mph speed limit, and clearer right-of-way rules. Board chair Dolores Orr stressed these safety improvements have been needed since the boardwalk’s post-Sandy rebuild.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police said Peña drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone and ran a red light, t-boning Justin Diaz near LaGuardia Airport. Peña had a history of 25 school-zone speeding tickets. The article quotes Diaz's brother: "We're sick, angry, disgusted." Peña was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusing a breath test. The release followed an appellate judge's decision, despite community outrage.
