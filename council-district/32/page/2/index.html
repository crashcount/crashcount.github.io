Prosecutors say Rosen pursued William McField, a 55-year-old motorcyclist, after a minor collision. On Woodhaven Boulevard, Rosen struck McField from behind, ran him over, and continued driving, dragging the motorcycle until it caught fire. Rosen then hit another car before stopping at a lamp post. McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes."

Streets turned dangerous in a blink.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on April 4, 2025, that two separate crashes in Queens left multiple pedestrians injured. In Astoria, a 35-year-old driver 'lost control of her vehicle and went onto the sidewalk, running over two girls, ages 7 and 14.' Police charged her with reckless driving and driving without a license. Later, in South Ozone Park, a 79-year-old driver swerved, sideswiped a bus, then 'jumped the curb and struck four women who were standing at a bus shelter.' All victims survived, but injuries ranged from broken bones to head trauma. The incidents highlight ongoing dangers for pedestrians and raise questions about driver screening and street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA demanded $4 billion from the city—a 33% jump from the last plan—warning of major subway disruptions if denied. The matter, titled 'MTA threatens another ‘Summer of Hell’ of subway disruptions if NYC doesn’t cough up billions,' drew sharp words. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Queens) blasted the agency: 'Instead of insulting us with baseless threats, the agency that spends $30 million on a staircase should find ways to cut its wasteful spending and bloated payroll before asking for more taxpayer money.' Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility. Despite heated criticism, council members did not strongly oppose the request in session.
