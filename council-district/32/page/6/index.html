She backed bills for better lighting on city stairways and for raised speed bumps at camera locations. She voted to require DOT to collect micromobility data and to redesign truck routes. These are small moves in the right direction.</p><p>But <strong>when it mattered most, Ariola stood in the way</strong>. She voted against expanding speed cameras to 24/7, a proven way to slow drivers and save lives. She opposed legalizing safe street crossings, keeping jaywalking penalties that blame the victim. She pushed for more red tape before the city can repurpose parking for safer uses. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>&ldquo;These cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,&rdquo; she argued, even as her own car racked up dozens of speeding tickets.</a></p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against proven safety, means more names on the list. <strong>Advocates must act.</strong> Call Ariola. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit.

Councilmember Joann Ariola opposes the plan, claiming it will worsen city travel. Delays threaten $1 billion in MTA funding. Vulnerable road users wait as traffic and pollution persist. No relief in sight.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2022, Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) joined critics in a policy debate over New York City's stalled congestion pricing plan. The measure, approved by state lawmakers three years ago, would charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The MTA faces hundreds of follow-up questions from the Federal Highway Administration, delaying the required environmental assessment. Ariola argued, 'I don’t believe it will work, in fact I believe it will make the city more unmanageable to travel through.' The plan is intended to reduce traffic, lower car pollution, and fund MTA capital improvements. Delays put $1 billion in annual funding at risk, threatening upgrades like accessible subway stations and zero-emission buses. As the debate drags on, vulnerable road users remain exposed to traffic and pollution hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The vote was 43 in favor, seven against. The matter summary: 'giving the state Legislature the go-ahead to pass a three-year extension and expansion of New York City's speed camera program that allows them to operate 24/7.' Council Member David Carr (District 50) voted no. Other Republicans and two Democrats also opposed. Ydanis Rodriguez, City Transportation Commissioner, said, 'Cameras will be 24/7 the whole year.' The bill now moves to the state legislature, which must act before June 2.

The bill aimed to amend the city code to 'establish a reward for individuals who provide information leading to the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person who seriously injures or kills another individual in a hit-and-run accident.' Council Member Rita C. Joseph sponsored the bill, joined by sixteen co-sponsors including Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, and others. The bill would have authorized up to $1,000 for information leading to the capture of hit-and-run drivers, but excluded law enforcement and city employees from eligibility. The measure was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. With the bill's failure, the city offers no extra incentive to help catch drivers who leave victims bleeding in the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
