Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five dead, twelve more with wounds that will not heal. <strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children—no one is spared.</strong></p><p>On Woodhaven Boulevard, a 23-year-old woman tried to cross the street. A motorcycle hit her. She died at the hospital. The police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>&ldquo;A 23-year-old woman died after a motorcycle rider ran over her as she was crossing the street in Queens early Friday morning.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No answers. Only another family left with a hole that never closes.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, three men stepped out of a car. A van driver lost control. One man, 31, died. The others survived. The police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Victim Zhihong Shi was exiting a double parked car with the two other victims near the corner of 87th St. and Atlantic Ave. in Woodhaven around 10:30 a.m. Friday when the driver of a passing Ford Econoline van lost control of his wheel.&rdquo;</a> The street stayed open. The risk stayed the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Joann Ariola has taken some steps. She backed bills for better lighting on city stairways and for raised speed bumps at camera locations. She voted to require DOT to collect micromobility data and to redesign truck routes. These are small moves in the right direction.</p><p>But <strong>when it mattered most, Ariola stood in the way</strong>. She voted against expanding speed cameras to 24/7, a proven way to slow drivers and save lives. She opposed legalizing safe street crossings, keeping jaywalking penalties that blame the victim. She pushed for more red tape before the city can repurpose parking for safer uses. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>&ldquo;These cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,&rdquo; she argued, even as her own car racked up dozens of speeding tickets.</a></p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against proven safety, means more names on the list. <strong>Advocates must act.</strong> Call Ariola. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras, not fewer. Demand streets that put people first, not parking. Do not wait for another name to be added to the roll call of the dead.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The work, running from Beach Channel Drive to Shore Front Parkway, added porous pavement, new bike lanes, and wider pedestrian walkways. The city says the 11,000 square feet of new surface can absorb nearly 1.3 million gallons of stormwater each year. Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes. The changes give cyclists and pedestrians an easier, safer route to the Rockaway ferry terminal and boardwalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill faces opposition from Council Members David Weprin, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan, who argue it will hurt small businesses and outer-borough residents. On May 22, 2023, Ari Kagan said, 'Congestion Pricing will hurt countless New Yorkers, small businesses, residents of so-called outer-boroughs & will create huge lines of parked cars right outside of Manhattan.' Yet, the MTA’s assessment shows only 5,200 city drivers commute by car from areas far from fast transit—just 1.2% of that population. Advocates like Felicia Park-Rogers counter, 'this policy has the potential to be utterly transformational for our city.' The plan includes exemptions for disabled and low-income drivers.

The bill proposed to amend the administrative code by expanding the definition of 'motorized scooter' to include e-bikes and e-scooters, raising civil penalties for violations from $250 to $500, and restoring impoundment authority. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the operation of motorized scooters, and to repeal subdivision e of section 19-176.2 of such code, relating to operators of electric scooters and bicycles with electric assist.'

The FDNY supported four out of five bills, including bans on second-use and non-certified batteries, a public safety campaign, and safety information for delivery workers. The FDNY expressed concern about resource demands for detailed annual fire reporting. The matter summary states the bills aim to address the rise of deadly fires from faulty batteries, often used by delivery workers. Council Member Joann Ariola urged the FDNY to consider international solutions and invest in safe charging infrastructure. Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas Unidos opposed the bans, arguing they punish low-income workers and miss root causes. The city recently abandoned a proposal to ban e-bikes on NYCHA property and is working on new charging stations.

Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) argued that open street programs, bike lanes, and traffic islands hinder emergency vehicles, especially when illegal parking blocks access. She called for better enforcement. Other voices, including union leaders, echoed her concerns. However, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan defended new street designs, stating they were built with emergency input. The Department of Transportation said all projects include emergency routes and are monitored. FDNY officials attributed delays to increased post-pandemic traffic, not street safety measures.
