Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year alone, District 32’s streets have not been safe. The numbers do not lie: 1,029 people hurt, 15 left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, neighbors. They are the young and the old—children, elders, and everyone in between.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a 22-year-old woman was ejected and killed on the Belt Parkway.</strong> Days before, a 39-year-old motorcyclist died on Jackie Robinson Parkway. Two men, 31 and 67, were struck and killed on Atlantic Avenue. The list goes on. The blood dries, but the pain lingers.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h2><p>Council Member Joann Ariola has acted, but not always for the most vulnerable. She voted to clear abandoned vehicles from the streets—<strong>a step toward safer crossings</strong> (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She co-sponsored a bill to require bike-share companies to display safety rules, but this does nothing to slow cars or protect children in crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).</p><p>But when it mattered most, Ariola voted against expanding speed cameras in school zones. She said, “these cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,” even as her own SUV racked up <strong>27 school-zone speeding tickets</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The cameras work. They slow cars. They save lives. The children do not get a vote.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-what-will-it-take>The Road Ahead: What Will It Take?</h2><p><strong>Speed is still the killer.</strong> Most deaths come from cars and SUVs. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. The carnage continues.</p><p><strong>“I wish they would never have given him that car—because if they didn’t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now,”</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>said Keisha Francis, whose 14-year-old was killed by an unlicensed teen driver</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not fate.

The mayor backs a park. Advocates demand transit. Poor residents lose out. Elected officials split. The city risks locking out thousands from jobs and care. The debate rages. No one asks the people.</p><p class=mb3>This op-ed, published April 4, 2024, covers the battle over the unused Rockaway Beach Branch rail line in southeastern Queens. The city, led by Mayor Adams, pushes a park-only project, funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director, argues the plan blocks a vital north-south rail corridor, denying disadvantaged communities access to jobs, education, and healthcare. The op-ed states: 'It is simply irresponsible to build a park on a viable transit right-of-way in the biggest city in America.' State Senators James Sanders, Jr. and Joe Addabbo, Assembly Member Stacey Amato, and Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, JoAnn Ariola, and Bob Holden support studies and funding for the rails-and-trails QueensLink alternative. The mayor’s plan faces criticism for ignoring public input and environmental justice.

The impact crushed the Volkswagen’s right side, killing a 32-year-old woman seated in the front passenger seat. The report states, 'A Jeep struck a Volkswagen broadside. The right side folded in. A 32-year-old woman in the front seat died. The airbag bloomed.' Police cite 'View Obstructed/Limited' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, drawing attention to driver error and systemic visibility hazards at this intersection. The victim was not ejected and the airbag deployed, but the force proved fatal. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard traffic controls and sightlines are compromised.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the crash occurred during a police pursuit. The report states the driver was 'Backing Unsafely' and did not possess a valid license. The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk at the time, but the report does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The narrative describes the scene: 'A fleeing Honda reversed into a man, not at a crosswalk. His leg was crushed under steel. He stayed conscious. The driver had no license. The streetlights flickered. Sirens followed.' The focus remains on the driver’s unlawful actions—operating without a license and reversing unsafely while fleeing police—which directly led to the pedestrian’s injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
