Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year alone, District 32’s streets have not been safe. The numbers do not lie: 1,029 people hurt, 15 left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, neighbors. They are the young and the old—children, elders, and everyone in between.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a 22-year-old woman was ejected and killed on the Belt Parkway.</strong> Days before, a 39-year-old motorcyclist died on Jackie Robinson Parkway. Two men, 31 and 67, were struck and killed on Atlantic Avenue. The list goes on. The blood dries, but the pain lingers.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h2><p>Council Member Joann Ariola has acted, but not always for the most vulnerable. She voted to clear abandoned vehicles from the streets—<strong>a step toward safer crossings</strong> (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She co-sponsored a bill to require bike-share companies to display safety rules, but this does nothing to slow cars or protect children in crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).</p><p>But when it mattered most, Ariola voted against expanding speed cameras in school zones. She said, “these cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,” even as her own SUV racked up <strong>27 school-zone speeding tickets</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The cameras work. They slow cars. They save lives. The children do not get a vote.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-what-will-it-take>The Road Ahead: What Will It Take?</h2><p><strong>Speed is still the killer.</strong> Most deaths come from cars and SUVs. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. The carnage continues.</p><p><strong>“I wish they would never have given him that car—because if they didn’t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now,”</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>said Keisha Francis, whose 14-year-old was killed by an unlicensed teen driver</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not fate.

Advocates warned new language could blame pedestrians for crashes. The bill would have let people cross mid-block, but now demands they yield to drivers. Racial bias in enforcement remains unaddressed.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2024, the City Council delayed action on a bill to legalize jaywalking. The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with advocates demanding stronger protections for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the collision occurred at 14:38 in Queens. Police cite 'Following Too Closely' as the contributing factor, placing the onus on the driver who failed to maintain a safe distance. No victim behavior is listed as a contributing factor. The narrative underscores the violence of the impact: 'Two tons of steel kissed too close. Her spine folded.'

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At least 25 stairways each year will get new lamps. Dark paths become visible. Pedestrians gain ground. Shadows shrink. Danger loses its cover.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0875-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after introduction on May 16, 2024. The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola, joined by sixteen co-sponsors, pushes for at least 25 step streets to be lit each year until all are covered. Step streets are open-air staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to strip darkness from these paths, making them safer for people on foot. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
