But she voted <strong>no</strong> on daylighting, a proven fix that clears sightlines at corners. She voted <strong>no</strong> on legalizing jaywalking, keeping a law that targets the vulnerable and lets drivers off the hook. When the Council moved to set 5 mph limits on Open Streets, she voted <strong>no</strong> again. On speed cameras, Ariola once voted against expansion, even as her own car racked up <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>27 school-zone speeding tickets</a>.
