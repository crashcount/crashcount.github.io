Twenty-nine left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,700 injured since 2022. The dead include cyclists, pedestrians, riders, and drivers. The living carry scars and empty chairs at the table. In the last year alone, <strong>six people died and 824 were hurt</strong> in 1,225 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a>).</p><p>Just days ago, a man on a scooter was thrown to the pavement and killed when a van turned left across his path in Queens. Police said, &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>police statement</a>). No arrests. The investigation drags on. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=vulnerable-lives-heavy-vehicles>Vulnerable Lives, Heavy Vehicles</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do the most harm.</strong> Cars and trucks killed ten people and injured hundreds more. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, bikes none. The pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the greater the risk. But the city keeps building for speed, not safety.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Joann Ariola has taken some steps. She sponsored bills for better lighting on city stairways and called for raised speed reducers at camera locations. But when it mattered most, she <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>voted against expanding speed cameras</a>—a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives. She also <a href=#citations>voted no on daylighting</a>, a simple fix that clears sightlines at corners and saves pedestrians. When the Council moved to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that punished the vulnerable—Ariola <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/12/breaking-council-balks-on-legalizing-jaywalking>voted no, standing in the way</a> of a shift that puts responsibility on drivers, not walkers.</p><p>The excuses pile up. The bodies do too. &ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said the father of a cyclist killed during a police pursuit</a>. &ldquo;It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Council Member Ariola. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand she back every measure that puts people before parking and speed. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024.
