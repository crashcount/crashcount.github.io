Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year alone, District 32’s streets have not been safe. The numbers do not lie: 1,029 people hurt, 15 left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, neighbors. They are the young and the old—children, elders, and everyone in between.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a 22-year-old woman was ejected and killed on the Belt Parkway.</strong> Days before, a 39-year-old motorcyclist died on Jackie Robinson Parkway. Two men, 31 and 67, were struck and killed on Atlantic Avenue. The list goes on. The blood dries, but the pain lingers.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h2><p>Council Member Joann Ariola has acted, but not always for the most vulnerable. She voted to clear abandoned vehicles from the streets—<strong>a step toward safer crossings</strong> (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She co-sponsored a bill to require bike-share companies to display safety rules, but this does nothing to slow cars or protect children in crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).</p><p>But when it mattered most, Ariola voted against expanding speed cameras in school zones. She said, “these cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,” even as her own SUV racked up <strong>27 school-zone speeding tickets</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The cameras work. They slow cars. They save lives. The children do not get a vote.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-what-will-it-take>The Road Ahead: What Will It Take?</h2><p><strong>Speed is still the killer.</strong> Most deaths come from cars and SUVs. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. The carnage continues.</p><p><strong>“I wish they would never have given him that car—because if they didn’t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now,”</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>said Keisha Francis, whose 14-year-old was killed by an unlicensed teen driver</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not fate.

The incident occurred as the man 'stepped from behind a parked car.' The report states the sedan was 'backing unsafely,' directly citing this driver action as a contributing factor. The narrative details, 'Steel struck skull. He fell. Blood spread on the cold street.' Despite the impact, the vehicle showed 'no damage.' The pedestrian remained conscious at the scene, his 'head torn open.' The police report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary focus remains on the unsafe reversing maneuver by the driver.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The truck’s right front bumper struck a 64-year-old woman who was crossing the street. She suffered a head injury with severe bleeding but remained conscious at the scene. The report notes the vehicle was an 'Oversized Vehicle,' listing this as a contributing factor. The pickup showed no visible damage after the collision. The pedestrian was not in a marked crosswalk or at a signal, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor—driver error and the oversized nature of the vehicle are explicitly highlighted. The incident underscores the lethal risk oversized vehicles pose to vulnerable road users in city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns.

The law orders the Department of Transportation to post current bicycle and micromobility ridership data online, updated monthly or at least yearly. The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Restler, Hudson, Schulman, and others. The law demands transparency on where riders travel and what DOT does to keep them safe. This opens the books on bike movement and exposes gaps in protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cabán’s platform promised safer streets and fewer cars. Ariola and others say the tickets show a gap between words and actions.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2024, Councilwoman Joann Ariola (District 32) publicly criticized Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán after media reports revealed Cabán received four school-zone speeding tickets and three other violations since November 2022. The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
