People on foot and bike take the hit. In three years, District 32 logged <strong>24 deaths and 3,095 injuries</strong> in 4,731 crashes. Pedestrians paid most: <strong>13 killed, 379 hurt</strong>. Cyclists weren’t spared: <strong>1 killed, 178 hurt</strong>. The numbers come from city data and cover 2022 through August 25, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The worst corridors are known. <strong><a href=#>Belt Parkway</a></strong> took four lives. <strong><a href=#>Woodhaven Boulevard</a></strong> took four. <strong><a href=#>Cross Bay Boulevard</a></strong> took two. <strong><a href=#>Jackie Robinson Parkway</a></strong> topped the list for injuries and deaths with three. Nights cut deeper. Crashes piled up from <strong>8 p.m. to 1 a.m.</strong>, with deadly hits at 20:00, 21:00, and 23:00 hours, and heavy injuries through midnight (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Unsafe speed shows up again and again in fatal files on these roads (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4769296</a>).</p><p>Wrong-way. Hit-and-run. Bodies ejected on the parkway. The clips are blunt. A Queens driver went wrong-way on the Clearview in 2023 and smashed into five cars. A jury convicted him. He told police he felt “liberated” after entering the highway to hurt people. The DA said he “terrorized other drivers.” He got eight years (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>). A <strong>52‑year‑old man</strong> crossing near JFK at 155th and South Conduit was hit and left to die at 2:30 a.m. “The operator of the vehicle fled the scene,” police said. No arrests (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>NY Daily News</a>). Two men ordering food in Queens were also struck and killed by a speeding car; the driver died too (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-pedestrians-1-driver-killed-when-car-slams-into-food-truck-in-queens/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=belt-and-woodhaven-keep-taking>Belt and Woodhaven keep taking</h3><p>On the <strong>Belt Parkway</strong>, fatal speed shows in the records. A 25‑year‑old driver died after a high‑speed lane change in November 2024. The file lists “Unsafe Speed.” Two late‑model cars, both eastbound, both demolished (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4769296</a>). In July 2025, two more young people were killed and two injured in another Belt crash with speed in the notes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4825307</a>).</p><p>On <strong>Woodhaven Boulevard</strong>, a 23‑year‑old woman crossing at night was struck and killed. The motorcycle file lists “Traffic Control Disregarded” and “Unsafe Speed” at the intersection by 83‑35 Woodhaven. She died there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4808010</a>). Districtwide, Woodhaven appears in the top tier for deaths and injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=nights-lights-bodies>Nights, lights, bodies</h3><p>This district bleeds after dark. From 8 p.m. to midnight, injuries stack up. Deaths spike at <strong>20:00 and 23:00</strong>. The city’s own tally shows a steady drumbeat through the night hours (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The <strong>Queens South</strong> patrol area, which includes the JFK hit‑and‑run site, had 17 traffic deaths this year through August 10, up from 13 last year, police told reporters (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Heavy vehicles are not the main killers here. Cars and SUVs are. They account for most pedestrian deaths and injuries in the district data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-leaders-didand-didnt>What leaders did—and didn’t</h3><p>Some steps are small and slow. The Council voted to force faster removal of derelict cars, clearing sightlines and corners. District 32’s member voted yes (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar Int 0857‑2024</a>). She also co‑sponsored a bill to make micromobility share operators show safety rules to riders (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar Int 1304‑2025</a>).</p><p>But on bigger levers, the record is mixed. In 2022, the Council backed 24/7 speed cameras, but seven members voted no. District 32’s member opposed expanded cameras that day, even as violations mounted on city streets (<a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>NY Post</a>; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>Streetsblog</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-the-deadly-places>Fix the deadly places</h3><p>Start where people die. Daylight corners and harden turns on <strong><a href=/neighborhood/qn0905/>Woodhaven Boulevard</a></strong> and <strong><a href=/neighborhood/qn1003/>Cross Bay Boulevard</a></strong>. Give leading walk time at major crossings. Slow the <strong><a href=/neighborhood/qn1403/>Belt Parkway</a></strong> and its service roads with speed management and targeted night enforcement. The data points to darkness; the response should, too. Focus on repeat hotspots and nighttime conditions—the known flags in this district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Then use the tools that cut speed citywide. <strong>Lower the default speed limit</strong> across the city. <strong>Require speed limiters for repeat camera offenders.</strong> These measures are on the table now. Lawmakers and advocates have already framed the path: protect 24/7 cameras, slow every street, and force the worst drivers to obey or park it. The city has the power to drop speeds; Albany is weighing devices for repeat speeders (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/18/council-members-want-to-be-notified-when-city-repurposes-their-parking>Streetsblog</a>; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/nyc-could-have-its-first-car-free-neighborhood-but-wont-get-it-due-to-revanchist-pols>Streetsblog</a>).</p><p>The names in the files are gone. The roads remain. Slow them now.</p><p>—</p><p>Want to help? Take one step. Tell City Hall to cut speeds and rein in repeat offenders.

The incident occurred as the man 'stepped from behind a parked car.' The report states the sedan was 'backing unsafely,' directly citing this driver action as a contributing factor. The narrative details, 'Steel struck skull. He fell. Blood spread on the cold street.' Despite the impact, the vehicle showed 'no damage.' The pedestrian remained conscious at the scene, his 'head torn open.' The police report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary focus remains on the unsafe reversing maneuver by the driver.

Critics say it slows life-saving street redesigns. Advocates warn it props up car culture and blocks safer bike lanes. The bill risks more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 103, now before the City Council, would require the Department of Transportation to notify Council members every time a single parking spot is repurposed—for car-share, bike corrals, or Citi Bike docks. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with advocates demanding stronger protections for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cabán’s platform promised safer streets and fewer cars. Ariola and others say the tickets show a gap between words and actions.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2024, Councilwoman Joann Ariola (District 32) publicly criticized Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán after media reports revealed Cabán received four school-zone speeding tickets and three other violations since November 2022. The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
