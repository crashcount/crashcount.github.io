Pedestrians are hit hardest here: eight killed, 257 injured, 15 seriously hurt. Cyclists: one killed, 214 injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>District stats</a>). SUVs show up most often in pedestrian harm: 71 pedestrian casualties with six deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>District stats</a>).</p><p>The city’s own numbers say what speed does. At 4 a.m., two dead. At 5 a.m., one. At 9 a.m., two more. The 5 p.m. hour holds four dead. Night keeps bleeding into dawn (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>RECENT NAMES, HARD STREETS</p><p>A 90‑year‑old woman died on York and East 72nd in February. The record lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” An SUV and a taxi were going straight. She was a pedestrian, outside an intersection. She died (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4790720</a>).</p><p>A 30‑year‑old woman died at York and East 87th in April. Three cars. She was in the intersection. The sheet says “Apparent Death” and “Severe Bleeding.” That is all (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4714580</a>).</p><p>On the FDR in February, a driver died. Unsafe speed. Ejected. The car was “Demolished” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4790343</a>). In July, a 55‑year‑old driver died at East 83rd and York. He lost consciousness behind the wheel, then was gone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4832831</a>).</p><p>PATTERNS THE CITY ALREADY KNOWS</p><p>“Unsafe speed” shows up in the dead. “Disregarded traffic control” does too. Failure to yield. Distraction. “Other” leads all factors in death and harm here, with 11 deaths and 402 injuries. Vulnerable road user errors are a small slice by comparison (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District factors</a>).</p><p>Late hours are hot. So is the evening rush. The 17:00 hour holds the most death. The 14:00–16:00 hours stack injuries like cordwood (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>WHAT COULD STOP THE HITS</p><p>Daylight the turns. Keep cars back from the crosswalk. There’s a bill for that. It would ban standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and force daylighting at 1,000 intersections a year. Council Member Julie Menin co‑sponsors it (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138‑2024</a>). Another bill she backs orders curb extensions each year at the worst crash corners (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0285‑2024</a>).</p><p>Small fixes matter on York and 2nd: hardened lefts, no‑parking daylighting, and curb extensions at signalized crossings. Clear sight lines save walkers and riders. The abandoned cars that block views? A new law forces the city to tow derelicts within 72 hours; Menin voted yes (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857‑2024 vote</a>).</p><p>CITYWIDE CHOICES THAT SAVE LIVES</p><p>Lower speeds citywide. Albany gave NYC the power. “Sammy’s Law gave NYC the power to set safer speeds,” our own call to action states. The next step is a default 20 mph, not a patchwork (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Stop the worst repeat speeders. The proposed Stop Super Speeders Act would require drivers with 11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year to use speed limiters that cap them within 5 mph of the posted limit (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>AFTERMATH AND THE NEXT LIGHT</p><p>After two people were killed at Bowery and Canal by a driver charged with going 109 mph, the city promised barriers and narrower lanes. “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” said Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>). Advocates warned the rest of the corridor stays deadly. “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” said Ben Furnas (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>). The upgrades came after two more names. That is the pattern.</p><p>District 5 does not need another vigil. It needs slower streets and clear corners. It needs action before the sirens.</p><p>One thing you can do today: push the city to set safer speeds and rein in repeat speeders. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, 'three cars collided in the dark. Steel screamed. A 42-year-old man, belted and bloodied, stayed conscious with head wounds. Airbags burst. Speed was the reason.' Two drivers were injured: a 42-year-old man suffered severe head lacerations, and an 18-year-old man reported pain in his arm. The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for all vehicles involved. No pedestrians or cyclists were involved. The crash left glass and wreckage scattered across the roadway, underscoring the danger of high-speed driving on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
