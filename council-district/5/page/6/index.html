She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let New York City set its own speed limits. She signed on to ban parking near crosswalks and to force the city to daylight 1,000 intersections a year. She pressed for protected bike lanes after a cyclist was killed on E. 85th. She demanded the Queensboro Bridge walkway open, calling delays <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/08/first-look-the-dot-finally-has-plans-for-its-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>&ldquo;a serious safety concern and impediment to movement for both pedestrians and cyclists.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The votes are not enough. The bills are not law until the streets change. The bridge path is still closed. The curb is still a killing ground.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call Menin. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand the bridge path open now.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

The event, not tied to a specific bill, saw Council Members Jennifer Gutiérrez, Julie Menin, Alexa Avilés, and Carlina Rivera demand urgent safety upgrades. The matter summary reads: 'City lawmakers and transportation and education advocates expressed outrage over a recent Streetsblog report on dangerous school streets, demanding the city do more to prevent drivers from harming children outside schools.' Lawmakers called the findings 'egregious' and 'unconscionable.' They urged more crossing guards, traffic calming, and car-free hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez signaled openness to restricting cars during key times. The council’s stance is clear: the city’s inaction puts children, especially those of color, at deadly risk.

Cyclists and walkers stay cramped on a narrow path. Cars keep nine lanes. Councilmember Julie Won urges action. DOT says repairs come first. Vulnerable road users wait. Danger lingers. Comfort for drivers wins again.</p><p class=mb3>On February 3, 2022, Councilmember Julie Won (District 26) and others responded to the city's decision to delay the Queensboro Bridge bike and pedestrian lane project. The Department of Transportation postponed converting the south outer roadway to a pedestrian-only path until December 2023, citing ongoing upper deck repairs. The matter, titled 'City punts fix for ‘treacherous’ Queensboro Bridge bike and pedestrian path by another year,' leaves cyclists and pedestrians sharing a dangerously tight path for another year. Councilmembers Julie Won and Julie Menin urged DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to speed up the process, calling the delay a safety concern. Cycling advocate Laura Shepard criticized the city for prioritizing drivers' comfort over vulnerable road users. DOT insists repairs must finish first. The delay keeps walkers and cyclists at risk, forced to share space while cars keep most of the bridge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
