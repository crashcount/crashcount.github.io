The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The city’s crosswalks remain unchanged.

The editorial, titled "With politicians fearful of the TWU, a public referendum is the answer," criticizes the City Council’s failure to act on a bill that would replace horses with electric carriages. Schulman highlights that only 18 of 51 council members sponsor the bill, despite strong public support and past campaign promises. She names Justin Brennan, Gale Brewer, Julie Menin, and herself among those who have not advanced the legislation. Schulman blames union influence for the council’s inaction, citing 115 accidents and 27 horse deaths over decades. She calls for a citizen ballot initiative to bypass political gridlock and protect both horses and the public from ongoing street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'special activation of the Open Streets program on certain holidays and time periods with significant pedestrian traffic.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan led as primary sponsor, joined by Julie Menin, Farah N. Louis, Julie Won, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Alexa Avilés, Lincoln Restler, Shahana K. Hanif, and Rita C.

The project, coordinated with Council Member Julie Menin, used fiber-reinforced polymer panels to shield riders from the bridge’s hazardous metal grating. The official matter: 'Roosevelt Island Bridge bike lane now covered for a safer, smoother ride.' Won praised the project’s quick finish and its promise of safer, more comfortable biking. DOT and community leaders noted the new surface prevents slips and flats, separating cyclists from traffic.

The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

New panels replace slick metal. Cyclists long feared the old surface. Advocates and council members fought for this. The pilot aims to end years of danger and delay.</p><p class=mb3>On October 25, 2022, the Department of Transportation announced a pilot project to replace the hazardous metal surface—known as the 'cheese grater'—on the Roosevelt Island Bridge bike lane. The project, not tied to a specific council bill, follows years of complaints from cyclists about the unsafe grates. DOT spokesperson Tomas Garita said, 'We are actively exploring and testing various materials that will improve safety and the overall cycling experience for all its users.' The pilot covers 300 metal panels on each side of the bridge and adds new flexible delineators. Local advocate Paul Krikler credited former Council Members Ben Kallos and Jimmy Van Bramer, and current Council Member Julie Menin, for securing funding. Cyclist Conor Lyman said the old surface kept riders away. The project is expected to finish by Thanksgiving, finally addressing a long-standing threat to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
