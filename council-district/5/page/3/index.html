Three of them over 75. One was ninety.</strong> In the last year and a half, District 5 has seen 320 people injured and 6 left with life-altering wounds. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on York Avenue, blood on the FDR, families waiting at the hospital for news that never comes.</p><p>Frances Rickard, 90, was crossing York Avenue at dusk. A yellow cab made a U-turn and hit her. A second car struck her moments later. She died at Weill Cornell. Both drivers stayed. No charges. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>&ldquo;Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On the FDR, a Tesla tore itself apart.

The old, the young, the nameless.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-been-done>What Has Been Done</h3><p>Council Member Julie Menin has backed bills for curb extensions, solar crosswalks, and a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let New York City set its own speed limits. She signed on to ban parking near crosswalks and to force the city to daylight 1,000 intersections a year. She pressed for protected bike lanes after a cyclist was killed on E. 85th. She demanded the Queensboro Bridge walkway open, calling delays <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/08/first-look-the-dot-finally-has-plans-for-its-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>&ldquo;a serious safety concern and impediment to movement for both pedestrians and cyclists.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The votes are not enough. The bills are not law until the streets change. The bridge path is still closed. The curb is still a killing ground.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call Menin. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand the bridge path open now. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with the families who have lost everything.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
