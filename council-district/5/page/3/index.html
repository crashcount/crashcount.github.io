The crash occurred at 17:41 in Manhattan. The report states, 'she stepped off the curb, alone, no signal. A taxi hit her head-on. An SUV rolled over her. Her skull crushed.' The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk. Both vehicles, a taxi and an SUV, were traveling straight ahead. The police report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The drivers 'did not see' her, according to the narrative. The victim suffered fatal head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.
