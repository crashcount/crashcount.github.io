In the last twelve months, five people died. Three were over 75. One was a child. <strong>229 people were injured. Three were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong></p><p>Just this spring, a taxi turned into a cyclist on East 94th. A sedan slammed into a parked car, leaving a pedestrian bleeding. An SUV struck an elderly woman crossing York Avenue. The numbers are not abstract. They are bodies in the crosswalk, blood on the curb, families waiting for news that never gets better.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed thirteen people and injured more than 1,100. Motorcycles and mopeds left four with serious injuries. Bikes caused one serious injury and dozens of minor wounds. The old and the young are hit hardest. The city’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data shows the pattern</a>: the older you are, the more likely you are to die when a driver makes a mistake.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Julie Menin has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles and add warning decals to taxi doors. She co-sponsored bills for high-visibility markings and curb extensions. But she also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>signed onto a bill that would weaken bus lane rules, putting more people at risk</a>.

The city’s slow pace keeps danger alive on narrow streets.</p><p class=mb3>This update covers the 'Make Way for Lower Manhattan' shared streets proposal, discussed July 1, 2022. The Department of Transportation (DOT) briefed Manhattan Community Board 1 on the plan, which aims to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists in the Financial District. The project, funded by $500,000 from then-Council Member Margaret Chin, remains in the study phase, delayed by the pandemic. DOT Project Manager Jenny Leung said the city is updating conditions and planning stakeholder engagement. Community Board 1 and the Financial District Neighborhood Association (FDNA) have backed the plan since 2015 and 2016, respectively. FDNA Board Member Catherine Hughes pressed for urgency, saying, 'It's time for a pilot project now.' Business leader Jessica Lappin voiced logistical concerns. The plan envisions shared streets with 5 mph speed limits and a future pedestrian plaza. Progress is slow. The city’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
