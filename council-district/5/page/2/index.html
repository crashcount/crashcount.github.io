In the last twelve months, five people died. Three were over 75. One was a child. <strong>229 people were injured. Three were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong></p><p>Just this spring, a taxi turned into a cyclist on East 94th. A sedan slammed into a parked car, leaving a pedestrian bleeding. An SUV struck an elderly woman crossing York Avenue. The numbers are not abstract. They are bodies in the crosswalk, blood on the curb, families waiting for news that never gets better.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed thirteen people and injured more than 1,100. Motorcycles and mopeds left four with serious injuries. Bikes caused one serious injury and dozens of minor wounds. The old and the young are hit hardest. The city’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data shows the pattern</a>: the older you are, the more likely you are to die when a driver makes a mistake.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Julie Menin has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles and add warning decals to taxi doors. She co-sponsored bills for high-visibility markings and curb extensions. But she also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>signed onto a bill that would weaken bus lane rules, putting more people at risk</a>.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.
