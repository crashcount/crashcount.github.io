Three of them over 75. One was ninety.</strong> In the last year and a half, District 5 has seen 320 people injured and 6 left with life-altering wounds. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on York Avenue, blood on the FDR, families waiting at the hospital for news that never comes.</p><p>Frances Rickard, 90, was crossing York Avenue at dusk. A yellow cab made a U-turn and hit her. A second car struck her moments later. She died at Weill Cornell. Both drivers stayed. No charges. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>&ldquo;Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On the FDR, a Tesla tore itself apart. A woman died, thrown from the car, the wreck burning in the night. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>&ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph].

The old, the young, the nameless.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-been-done>What Has Been Done</h3><p>Council Member Julie Menin has backed bills for curb extensions, solar crosswalks, and a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let New York City set its own speed limits. She signed on to ban parking near crosswalks and to force the city to daylight 1,000 intersections a year. She pressed for protected bike lanes after a cyclist was killed on E. 85th. She demanded the Queensboro Bridge walkway open, calling delays <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/08/first-look-the-dot-finally-has-plans-for-its-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>&ldquo;a serious safety concern and impediment to movement for both pedestrians and cyclists.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The votes are not enough. The bills are not law until the streets change. The bridge path is still closed. The curb is still a killing ground.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call Menin. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand the bridge path open now. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with the families who have lost everything.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Starting May 18, the north outer roadway becomes bike-only, while the south outer roadway, once for vehicles, opens to pedestrians. The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays. The change doubles space for non-drivers and removes a vehicle lane, addressing years of systemic risk from forced mixing of vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.

Councilmember Julie Menin (District 5) said, 'We received no communication whatsoever about these very significant changes.' Menin wrote to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, demanding answers and citing a lack of community input. Residents and drivers complained the change slowed cars and let e-bikes speed unchecked.
