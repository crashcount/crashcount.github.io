Pedestrians are hit hardest here: eight killed, 257 injured, 15 seriously hurt. Cyclists: one killed, 214 injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>District stats</a>). SUVs show up most often in pedestrian harm: 71 pedestrian casualties with six deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>District stats</a>).</p><p>The city’s own numbers say what speed does. At 4 a.m., two dead. At 5 a.m., one. At 9 a.m., two more. The 5 p.m. hour holds four dead. Night keeps bleeding into dawn (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>RECENT NAMES, HARD STREETS</p><p>A 90‑year‑old woman died on York and East 72nd in February. The record lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” An SUV and a taxi were going straight. She was a pedestrian, outside an intersection. She died (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4790720</a>).</p><p>A 30‑year‑old woman died at York and East 87th in April. Three cars. She was in the intersection. The sheet says “Apparent Death” and “Severe Bleeding.” That is all (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4714580</a>).</p><p>On the FDR in February, a driver died. Unsafe speed. Ejected. The car was “Demolished” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4790343</a>). In July, a 55‑year‑old driver died at East 83rd and York. He lost consciousness behind the wheel, then was gone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4832831</a>).</p><p>PATTERNS THE CITY ALREADY KNOWS</p><p>“Unsafe speed” shows up in the dead. “Disregarded traffic control” does too. Failure to yield. Distraction. “Other” leads all factors in death and harm here, with 11 deaths and 402 injuries. Vulnerable road user errors are a small slice by comparison (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District factors</a>).</p><p>Late hours are hot. So is the evening rush. The 17:00 hour holds the most death. The 14:00–16:00 hours stack injuries like cordwood (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>WHAT COULD STOP THE HITS</p><p>Daylight the turns. Keep cars back from the crosswalk. There’s a bill for that. It would ban standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and force daylighting at 1,000 intersections a year. Council Member Julie Menin co‑sponsors it (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138‑2024</a>). Another bill she backs orders curb extensions each year at the worst crash corners (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0285‑2024</a>).</p><p>Small fixes matter on York and 2nd: hardened lefts, no‑parking daylighting, and curb extensions at signalized crossings. Clear sight lines save walkers and riders. The abandoned cars that block views? A new law forces the city to tow derelicts within 72 hours; Menin voted yes (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857‑2024 vote</a>).</p><p>CITYWIDE CHOICES THAT SAVE LIVES</p><p>Lower speeds citywide. Albany gave NYC the power. “Sammy’s Law gave NYC the power to set safer speeds,” our own call to action states. The next step is a default 20 mph, not a patchwork (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Stop the worst repeat speeders. The proposed Stop Super Speeders Act would require drivers with 11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year to use speed limiters that cap them within 5 mph of the posted limit (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>AFTERMATH AND THE NEXT LIGHT</p><p>After two people were killed at Bowery and Canal by a driver charged with going 109 mph, the city promised barriers and narrower lanes. “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” said Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>). Advocates warned the rest of the corridor stays deadly. “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” said Ben Furnas (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>). The upgrades came after two more names. That is the pattern.</p><p>District 5 does not need another vigil. It needs slower streets and clear corners. It needs action before the sirens.</p><p>One thing you can do today: push the city to set safer speeds and rein in repeat speeders. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The vehicles will not operate autonomously; human drivers will remain behind the wheel, as state law forbids fully driverless cars. Waymo is lobbying for a law change to allow autonomous operation, but the effort has stalled in the State Assembly. Mayoral spokeswoman Sophia Askari said, "Public safety is our first priority, which is why we have strong guardrails and requirements in place on any sort of autonomous vehicles." The city’s Department of Transportation is reviewing Waymo’s permit application, the first under the new Autonomous Vehicle Demonstration or Testing Permit Program.

The article details heated opposition from local residents and bus riders, who argued the plan was rushed and lacked proper traffic analysis. Stacy Rauch, a daily bus rider, said, 'The bigger problem is we don’t have enough buses.' Critics worried diverted car traffic would overwhelm nearby streets. The city compared the move to the 14th Street car ban, but residents noted differences in bus frequency.

The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

The MTA and state officials dismissed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s threats to withdraw funding as a 'sham,' arguing that the dispute is already in court. Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.' The federal government’s push to end the tolls, and the MTA’s resistance, highlight a clash over control of city streets and transit funding.

Council Member Gale Brewer criticized the move, stating, "A civil summons is a more appropriate response and thrusting people into the criminal justice system unnecessarily is bad public policy." The article notes that some officers issued summonses for actions legalized in 2019, such as cyclists proceeding with a pedestrian walk signal. Many tickets were dismissed in court due to errors by police. A class action lawsuit has been filed by a cyclist ticketed for a legal maneuver. The crackdown raises questions about enforcement priorities and the risk of criminalizing vulnerable road users instead of addressing systemic dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.
