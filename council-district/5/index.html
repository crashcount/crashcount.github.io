In the last twelve months, five people died. Three were over 75. One was a child. <strong>229 people were injured. Three were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong></p><p>Just this spring, a taxi turned into a cyclist on East 94th. A sedan slammed into a parked car, leaving a pedestrian bleeding. An SUV struck an elderly woman crossing York Avenue. The numbers are not abstract. They are bodies in the crosswalk, blood on the curb, families waiting for news that never gets better.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed thirteen people and injured more than 1,100. Motorcycles and mopeds left four with serious injuries. Bikes caused one serious injury and dozens of minor wounds. The old and the young are hit hardest. The city’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data shows the pattern</a>: the older you are, the more likely you are to die when a driver makes a mistake.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Julie Menin has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles and add warning decals to taxi doors. She co-sponsored bills for high-visibility markings and curb extensions. But she also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>signed onto a bill that would weaken bus lane rules, putting more people at risk</a>.

The Manhattan Community Board 5 called this move not a "real solution" to safety, urging a return to the 2021 plan with protected bike lanes and faster bus service. "We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue," said CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia. The board warns that without bike lanes, cyclists will ride sidewalks, risking conflict. The plan, shaped with business interests, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and delays safer changes until at least 2028.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
