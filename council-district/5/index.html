Double-parking allowed to help passengers. Streets grow tighter. Danger for walkers and riders rises.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 1339-2025 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced July 14, 2025, by Council Members Julie Menin and Linda Lee, it would 'exempt ambulettes from certain bus lane restrictions and allow them to double park to assist passengers.' The bill grants ambulettes the right to drive, stop, and double-park in bus lanes while helping passengers. Menin and Lee sponsor the measure, which was referred to committee on July 14. No safety analysis was provided. The change would squeeze vulnerable road users, making sidewalks and crossings riskier.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
