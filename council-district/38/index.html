Over 3,100 injured.</strong> Twenty-eight left with wounds so deep they are called serious injuries. These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children. They are the man crushed crossing 4th Avenue, the woman struck down by a turning sedan, the cyclist thrown from his bike. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><p>Just days ago, two men were killed at 52nd Street and Third Avenue. A BMW ran the red, hit them, and sped away. Police found the driver later. The bodies stayed behind. &ldquo;EMS pronounced both men dead at the scene. Their identities are being withheld pending family notification,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pedestrians-hit-and-run-brooklyn/>reported amNY</a>. The corner where they died has seen <strong>59 crashes and 80 injuries in five years</strong>—a slow-motion slaughter.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> Cars and trucks did most of the killing: 5 deaths, 248 minor injuries, 121 moderate, 7 serious. Motorcycles and mopeds took more. Bikes left dozens hurt. The old, the young, the ones on foot—they are the ones who die first. The street is not fair.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-stalled>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Stalled</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has backed bills to clear abandoned cars, fix curbs, and daylight crosswalks—measures that help, but do not end the bloodshed. She voted yes to remove derelict vehicles within 72 hours, aiming to clear blocked sightlines and crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see bill summary</a>). She co-sponsored a law to ban parking near crosswalks, demanding the city install daylighting barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. But the bill sits in committee, waiting. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-voices-left-behind>The Voices Left Behind</h3><p>After the hit-and-run, the charges stacked up: manslaughter, negligent homicide, reckless driving. &ldquo;Florentino was charged with two counts each of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, leaving the scene of an accident without reporting, and reckless endangerment,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pedestrians-hit-and-run-brooklyn/>wrote amNY</a>. The law comes after the fact. The families are left with silence.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the Council delays, another family is broken. Call Council Member Avilés. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Judge Ventura issued a restraining order after Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld appealed the city’s move. The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.' The article highlights weak enforcement of parking rules and the city’s reversal against its own DOT’s safety plan. The case underscores how political pressure and lax enforcement can threaten vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets remain deadly.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (2025-06-24) reports a 17-year-old died after his moped collided with a Genesis G80 driven by a 71-year-old man making a left turn on East 8th St. in Brooklyn. Police said the moped 'slammed into' the car, then hit a parked Honda Odyssey. Both the teen and his passenger suffered trauma; the teen died at Maimonides Medical Center. The car driver remained at the scene. No arrests were made, and the NYPD Highway District Collision Squad is investigating. The article also notes a separate fatal moped crash days earlier involving a drunk, unlicensed driver. These incidents highlight persistent risks for vulnerable road users and ongoing gaps in street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Pigford rear-ended Cifuni, then stopped two blocks away. When Cifuni approached, Pigford 'refused to roll down her window or speak,' then accelerated, striking and dragging Cifuni. The article quotes Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle.' Pigford then made an illegal turn and fled. The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run driving and the dangers posed by unlicensed, reckless drivers operating stolen vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The court found the city may have acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally" by ordering the removal without proper legal notice. City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children. The city claimed it would only shift the lane, not remove it, but advocates countered that any removal increases danger.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths).
