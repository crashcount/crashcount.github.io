They had the light. The BMW driver ran the red and kept going. Both men died where they stood. The city had known this stretch was deadly. Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured <strong>80 people</strong> along these two miles. The city promised a redesign. The promise broke. The bodies remain. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again,&rdquo;</a> said State Senator Andrew Gounardes.</p><h3 id=children-cross-nine-lanes>Children Cross Nine Lanes</h3><p>Every day, children cross nine lanes of traffic to get to school. Residents say they can&rsquo;t send their kids to the store for milk. The city’s answer is a sign: &ldquo;Be careful.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;We should all be offended. Angry. Insulted. That the response from our city to two deaths blocks away from here is a sign that says: &lsquo;be careful,&rsquo;&rdquo;</a> said Senator Gounardes. The driver who killed Chen and Lin was arrested. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=council-member-avilés-votes-and-silence>Council Member Avilés: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has voted for bills to clear abandoned vehicles and add warning decals to taxis, and co-sponsored laws for curb repair, daylighting, and speed humps. She stood with families at the scene. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We want the city to actually commit real capital to make sure that it can do treatments that truly address the safety concerns while balancing the fact that we have an industrial business zone here,&rdquo;</a> she said. But the redesign is still stalled. The city’s plan has been &ldquo;paused&rdquo; for years. No timeline. No updates. The street keeps killing.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>In the last twelve months, District 38 saw <strong>6 deaths</strong> and <strong>1,130 injuries</strong> from crashes. Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt. Cars and SUVs killed 7. Trucks and buses killed 2. Bikes and motorcycles caused 1 death and 19 injuries. The crisis is not abstract. It is a body count.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call Council Member Avilés. Demand the city finish the Third Avenue redesign. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Judge Ventura issued a restraining order after Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld appealed the city’s move. The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.' The article highlights weak enforcement of parking rules and the city’s reversal against its own DOT’s safety plan.
