Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 3,000 hurt since 2022. In the last year alone, three more lives ended. Nine more people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead are old and young. A 70-year-old woman struck crossing with the signal. A 30-year-old man crushed by a truck. An 82-year-old killed by a motorcycle. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most damage.</strong> They killed at least five, left over 120 with moderate or serious injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, injured four. Bikes hurt ten. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, the old, the young—pay the price. The drivers keep moving.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has taken steps. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills</a> to ban parking near crosswalks, add speed humps, and toughen penalties for sidewalk parking. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/03/02/streetsblog-gets-action-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-lithium-ion-bills-advance-in-council>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-action-fourth-avenue-cyclist-killed/>joined calls for protected bike lanes</a> on Fourth Avenue after another cyclist was killed. But the danger remains. Promised safety upgrades stall. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/18/dot-continues-to-ignore-dangers-it-created-on-brooklyns-4th-ave>Bike lanes vanish during construction</a>. The city drags its feet while people die. <strong>Every delay is another body.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. But only if leaders act. Only if residents demand it. Call Council Member Avilés. Call the Mayor. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted crosswalks, and lower speed limits. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren.

Fear spreads. Court dates loom. Immigration cases hang in the balance. Council Member Avilés slams the move. Advocates warn: this policy endangers lives and livelihoods.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, the NYPD announced a shift: cyclists, especially delivery workers, now face criminal court summonses for minor traffic violations. The department claims it is responding to e-bike complaints, but has offered no data. Council Member Alexa Avilés (D-Sunset Park) condemned the policy, saying, 'contact with the NYPD is a premise for the deportation pipeline.' She accused Mayor Adams of political maneuvering and failing to address street safety equitably. Lawyers warn that criminal charges can derail immigration cases, exposing workers to ICE. App companies like Uber Eats oppose criminalization, while GrubHub urges legal compliance. Transportation Alternatives launched a petition against the crackdown. The Adams administration also leaked a draft bill to regulate delivery apps, but it has stalled. The new enforcement targets the city’s most vulnerable road users—immigrant cyclists—putting their safety and futures at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, previously endorsed by Community Board 7, would have removed one of three lanes in each direction to add a parking-protected bike lane and shorten pedestrian crossings. Local business groups, including the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation, opposed the redesign, claiming it would disrupt their operations. Board chair Julio Peña criticized DOT for yielding to business interests, saying, 'It reeks of what happened on McGuinness Boulevard.' Council Member Alexa Avilés acknowledged community excitement but stressed the need for consultation. DOT cited 'additional outreach' as the reason for the delay. The area has seen multiple cyclist and pedestrian deaths. Data shows similar road diets have reduced serious injuries and deaths elsewhere in the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred after a 'sudden swerve,' with one vehicle changing lanes and the other going straight ahead. The report lists 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors, both indicating driver error. The 21-year-old male driver of a 2007 Toyota SUV suffered severe facial bleeding but remained conscious and was wearing a lap belt and harness. The point of impact was the center front end of the Toyota and the right rear bumper of the 2019 Ford SUV. No pedestrians or cyclists were involved. The collision underscores the dangers of sudden maneuvers and close following distances on high-speed expressways, as documented in the official report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Trucks keep rolling.</p><p class=mb3>Council bill (2023) mandated DOT to publish a truck route network redesign report by September 15, 2024. The Transportation Committee oversees the law. Council Member Alexa Avilés sponsored the bill, citing freight traffic’s toll on her district. The law’s summary: DOT must report on redesign, using over 2,000 public comments. Many comments—36 percent—flagged dangerous conflicts between trucks, pedestrians, and cyclists. DOT missed the deadline, blaming an extended comment period. Elizabeth Yeampierre (UPROSE) demanded fewer trucks on residential streets and routes away from schools and parks. Maria Fernanda Pulido-Velosa (El Puente) called for real engagement and clear communication if delays continue. DOT now promises more outreach and a microhubs pilot for last-mile deliveries. But the overdue report leaves vulnerable road users exposed to daily risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
