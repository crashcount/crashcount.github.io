Twenty-eight left with serious injuries. Over 3,100 wounded.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are mothers, fathers, children, neighbors. The dead do not speak, but the silence is heavy.</p><p>Just days ago, two men were killed at Third Avenue and 52nd Street. The car did not slow. The driver ran the red. Both men died where they stood, near a food pantry line. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>City Harvest expressed deep sadness over the tragic deaths</a>.

Trucks and buses killed one, injured 36. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, injured 19. Bikes injured 38. The street is a battlefield, and the weapons are heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=council-member-avilés-action-and-inaction>Council Member Avilés: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has backed bills to clear abandoned cars, fix sidewalks, and ban fake plates. She voted to remove derelict vehicles and co-sponsored laws for more daylight at intersections and speed humps near parks. She voted to decriminalize jaywalking and called for more transparency. But the carnage continues. <strong>No law yet has stopped the blood from running in the gutter.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without change is another day someone does not come home. Call Council Member Avilés. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Do not wait for the next siren. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A cyclist, 56, struck the bumper, thrown hard to the street. No helmet. Head bleeding. Conscious. The pavement held him. The driver stayed.' The driver’s failure to yield directly led to the collision and injury. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned after the driver’s error.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The man was crossing the street when a northbound motorcycle, operated by an unlicensed rider, struck him head-on. The report states the impact was to the 'center front end' of the motorcycle, resulting in fatal head injuries to the pedestrian. The police report specifically notes the driver's license status as 'unlicensed,' highlighting a critical driver error. The narrative confirms the rider 'hit him square,' and the man died at the scene. While the report mentions the pedestrian was 'crossing without a signal,' it does not list this as a contributing factor, instead marking both contributing factors as 'unspecified.' The focus remains on the unlicensed operation of the motorcycle and the lethal consequences for a vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the e-scooter rider suffered crush injuries to his arm but remained awake and conscious at the scene. The SUV, registered in New York and operated by a licensed driver from New Jersey, was described as 'starting from parking' at the time of the crash. The point of impact was the left front quarter panel of the SUV and the center front end of the e-scooter. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.'

Fewer hazards for those on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0857-2024, now at the Mayor's desk, passed the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on April 18, 2024. The bill states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code... in relation to vehicles reported as abandoned to the department of sanitation.' Sponsored by Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (primary) and co-sponsored by over a dozen council members, it forces the Department of Sanitation to remove derelict vehicles within 72 hours and empowers NYPD to tow cars with missing or obscured plates or stickers. The law aims to clear street hazards fast, reducing risks for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
