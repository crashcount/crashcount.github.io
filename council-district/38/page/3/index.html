Twenty-eight left with serious injuries. Over 3,100 wounded.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are mothers, fathers, children, neighbors. The dead do not speak, but the silence is heavy.</p><p>Just days ago, two men were killed at Third Avenue and 52nd Street. The car did not slow. The driver ran the red. Both men died where they stood, near a food pantry line. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>City Harvest expressed deep sadness over the tragic deaths</a>.

Trucks and buses killed one, injured 36. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, injured 19. Bikes injured 38. The street is a battlefield, and the weapons are heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=council-member-avilés-action-and-inaction>Council Member Avilés: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has backed bills to clear abandoned cars, fix sidewalks, and ban fake plates. She voted to remove derelict vehicles and co-sponsored laws for more daylight at intersections and speed humps near parks. She voted to decriminalize jaywalking and called for more transparency. But the carnage continues. <strong>No law yet has stopped the blood from running in the gutter.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without change is another day someone does not come home. Call Council Member Avilés. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Do not wait for the next siren. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
