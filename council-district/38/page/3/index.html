They had the light. The BMW driver ran the red, hit them, and kept going. Both men died in the street. Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured <strong>80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The city put up a sign: &ldquo;Be careful.&rdquo; The bodies keep coming. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;We should all be offended. Angry. Insulted. That the response from our city to two deaths blocks away from here is a sign that says: &lsquo;be careful,&rsquo;&rdquo;</a> said State Senator Andrew Gounardes.</p><h3 id=a-corridor-built-for-speed-not-life>A Corridor Built for Speed, Not Life</h3><p>Third Avenue is a trench. Nine lanes wide. Trucks and cars pour off the highway ramps. Residents cross to get home, to get to school, to buy groceries. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;They speed off the ramp coming to this local street thinking it&rsquo;s a race,&rdquo;</a> said Jerry Chan. The city promised a redesign with protected bike lanes. The plan stalled. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes asked, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=council-member-avilés-action-and-delay>Council Member Avilés: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has called for real investment and safety treatments, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>demanding the city &ldquo;commit real capital to make sure that it can do treatments that truly address the safety concerns&rdquo;</a>. She has voted for and co-sponsored bills to clear abandoned cars, ban parking near crosswalks, and speed up curb repairs. She backed the law to decriminalize jaywalking. But the dead keep coming. The redesign is still on hold. Promises do not stop cars.</p><h3 id=the-toll-relentless-and-rising>The Toll: Relentless and Rising</h3><p>In the last twelve months, District 38 saw <strong>6 deaths and 1,127 injuries</strong> from crashes. Most of the dead were on foot. Most of the injured never saw it coming. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call Council Member Avilés. Call the Mayor. Demand the city finish the Third Avenue redesign, install real protection, and slow the cars.

The pedestrian was found in the roadway with fatal head trauma and crush injuries. The report notes, 'No skid marks. No damage to the truck.' The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'Only silence where a life had been.' The vehicle, a 2020 INTL-TRUCK/BUS registered in Indiana, showed no visible damage. The driver was licensed in Pennsylvania. The report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The police report does not cite any pedestrian actions as contributing to the crash. The absence of skid marks and damage underscores the brutal efficiency of the impact. The systemic danger remains: a human body, no match for a truck rolling through city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
