Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 3,000 hurt since 2022. In the last year alone, three more lives ended. Nine more people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead are old and young. A 70-year-old woman struck crossing with the signal. A 30-year-old man crushed by a truck. An 82-year-old killed by a motorcycle. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most damage.</strong> They killed at least five, left over 120 with moderate or serious injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, injured four. Bikes hurt ten. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, the old, the young—pay the price. The drivers keep moving.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has taken steps. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills</a> to ban parking near crosswalks, add speed humps, and toughen penalties for sidewalk parking. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/03/02/streetsblog-gets-action-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-lithium-ion-bills-advance-in-council>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-action-fourth-avenue-cyclist-killed/>joined calls for protected bike lanes</a> on Fourth Avenue after another cyclist was killed. But the danger remains. Promised safety upgrades stall. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/18/dot-continues-to-ignore-dangers-it-created-on-brooklyns-4th-ave>Bike lanes vanish during construction</a>. The city drags its feet while people die. <strong>Every delay is another body.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. But only if leaders act. Only if residents demand it. Call Council Member Avilés. Call the Mayor. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted crosswalks, and lower speed limits. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Brooks-Powers, Louis, Nurse, Ossé, Sanchez, Cabán, Banks, Avilés, Riley, Salaam, Hanif, Feliz, Won, Restler, and Joseph. The bill directs DOT to seek community input for more activation days. Applications for these special activations follow the same review as regular Open Streets.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle," forces the NYPD to add 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a specific reporting category in quarterly and annual use of force reports. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Won, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Avilés, Abreu, Ossé, Krishnan, Williams, Cabán, Nurse, Sanchez, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force.

One in five vehicles is a heavy hauler. Warehouses multiply. Council Member Alexa Avilés passed a bill to force a truck route redesign. The city drags its feet. Cyclists and walkers face danger. The truckpocalypse rolls on.</p><p class=mb3>City Council Member Alexa Avilés led a bill last year requiring New York City to redesign Red Hook’s truck routes and submit a report by September 2024. The bill responds to a surge in last-mile warehouses, with trucks and vans now making up nearly 21 percent of Van Brunt Street traffic. The matter summary states, 'requiring the city to redesign its truck route and submit a report by September 2024.' Avilés sponsored the bill; three more bills for further study remain stalled. Locals call the influx a 'truckpocalypse.' Residents and advocates warn of rising pollution and danger for people on foot and bike. The city’s slow response leaves vulnerable road users exposed as warehouse traffic grows unchecked.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
