Over 3,100 injured.</strong> Twenty-eight left with wounds so deep they will never heal. These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the faces you pass on the avenue, the hands you hold at home.</p><p>Just days ago, two men were killed crossing Third Avenue in Sunset Park. The driver left them in the street and drove away. &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>said the driver</a>. The blood alcohol was below the legal limit. The law did not save them. The street did not save them. No one did.</p><p>A few blocks away, a young woman sat on a curb in a parking lot. Her boyfriend spun his car in circles. He lost control. She died before sunrise. &ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said the police</a>. The tire marks stayed for days. The loss will last longer.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm:</strong> 5 deaths, 7 serious injuries, 381 people hurt. <strong>Trucks and buses:</strong> 1 death, 36 injured. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds:</strong> 1 death, 19 injured. <strong>Bikes:</strong> 38 injured. The deadliest machines keep rolling. The most vulnerable keep falling.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-what-must-be-done>What Has Been Done, What Must Be Done</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has voted for and sponsored bills to clear abandoned vehicles, repair curbs, and add speed humps near parks. She voted to decriminalize jaywalking and to require better pavement markings. She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, but it sits in committee, waiting. She voted yes to remove abandoned vehicles within 72 hours—a step toward clearer sightlines and safer crossings. But the deaths keep coming.</p><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of loss.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong> Call Council Member Avilés. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking. Demand streets where no one is left to die alone. The time for waiting is over.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
