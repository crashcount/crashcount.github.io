Twenty-eight more are left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 3,100 have been hurt since 2022. Every number is a name, a family, a life cut or broken. The dead are not just numbers. They are elders, children, neighbors. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, killed by a turning sedan at 7th Avenue and 44th Street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). An 82-year-old man, struck by a motorcycle on 60th Street. A 66-year-old woman, ejected from her moped, died on 39th Street. The list goes on. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks are the main threat.</strong> They account for most deaths and injuries to people on foot. SUVs and sedans alone have killed five pedestrians and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses have claimed another life. Motorcycles and mopeds are not far behind, with one death and dozens of injuries. Bikes have hurt, but not killed. The danger is not spread evenly. It is heavy, fast, and often unseen until too late.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-not-taken>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Not Taken</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has moved on some fronts. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to clear abandoned vehicles</a> from the streets, a step to open sightlines and protect those on foot and bike. She backed bills for curb repair, speed humps near parks, and more transparency on police vehicle force. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act. She voted to decriminalize jaywalking, a move to stop blaming the dead for their own deaths. But the work is not done. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A neighbor said it plain after a recent crash: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter.&rdquo;</a> The pain does not fade. The tire marks linger in the parking lot. The empty chair at the table stays empty.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end the reign of reckless drivers. <strong>Call Council Member Avilés. Demand action.</strong> Demand 20 mph limits, protected crossings, and enforcement that targets the real danger—drivers, not the people they kill. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Seabrook faces 23 charges, including manslaughter, leaving the scene, unlicensed driving, and speeding. The case highlights repeated driver offenses and questions about bail and enforcement.
