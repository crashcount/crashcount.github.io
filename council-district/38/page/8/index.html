Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 3,000 hurt since 2022. In the last year alone, three more lives ended. Nine more people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead are old and young. A 70-year-old woman struck crossing with the signal. A 30-year-old man crushed by a truck. An 82-year-old killed by a motorcycle. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most damage.</strong> They killed at least five, left over 120 with moderate or serious injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, injured four. Bikes hurt ten. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, the old, the young—pay the price. The drivers keep moving.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has taken steps. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills</a> to ban parking near crosswalks, add speed humps, and toughen penalties for sidewalk parking. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/03/02/streetsblog-gets-action-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-lithium-ion-bills-advance-in-council>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-action-fourth-avenue-cyclist-killed/>joined calls for protected bike lanes</a> on Fourth Avenue after another cyclist was killed. But the danger remains. Promised safety upgrades stall. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/18/dot-continues-to-ignore-dangers-it-created-on-brooklyns-4th-ave>Bike lanes vanish during construction</a>. The city drags its feet while people die. <strong>Every delay is another body.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. But only if leaders act. Only if residents demand it. Call Council Member Avilés. Call the Mayor. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted crosswalks, and lower speed limits. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by sixteen co-sponsors. The bill would have required the Department of Transportation to install speed humps on all roadways next to parks at least one acre in size, unless the DOT commissioner found installation unsafe or inconsistent with guidelines. The bill was filed without passage at the end of the session.

The crash happened on Ninth Avenue near 39th Street, a corridor plagued by illegal parking and absent bike protection. Council Member Alexa Aviles, who represents the district, publicly supported protected bike lanes and immediate implementation of commercial waste zones, stating, 'We cannot postpone regulating the commercial waste industry any longer, and we need real protected bike infrastructure without delay.' The matter, highlighted in a councilmember statement on street safety, underscores the urgent need for city action. Advocates and officials criticized the NYPD’s lax response to illegal parking and placard abuse, which endanger cyclists and pedestrians. The call is clear: government must act now to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They want special permits to drop parking. They say parking rules drive up costs, block affordable homes, and fuel car use. The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
