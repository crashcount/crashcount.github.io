Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 3,000 hurt since 2022. In the last year alone, three more lives ended. Nine more people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead are old and young. A 70-year-old woman struck crossing with the signal. A 30-year-old man crushed by a truck. An 82-year-old killed by a motorcycle. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most damage.</strong> They killed at least five, left over 120 with moderate or serious injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, injured four. Bikes hurt ten. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, the old, the young—pay the price. The drivers keep moving.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has taken steps. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills</a> to ban parking near crosswalks, add speed humps, and toughen penalties for sidewalk parking. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/03/02/streetsblog-gets-action-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-lithium-ion-bills-advance-in-council>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-action-fourth-avenue-cyclist-killed/>joined calls for protected bike lanes</a> on Fourth Avenue after another cyclist was killed. But the danger remains. Promised safety upgrades stall. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/18/dot-continues-to-ignore-dangers-it-created-on-brooklyns-4th-ave>Bike lanes vanish during construction</a>. The city drags its feet while people die. <strong>Every delay is another body.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. But only if leaders act. Only if residents demand it. Call Council Member Avilés. Call the Mayor. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted crosswalks, and lower speed limits. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary states: 'Fossil fuel-emitting cruise ships would have to walk the plank and abandon New York City ports unless they plug into clean shore power for energy.' Avilés, at the hearing, said, 'The Red Hook community has not seen economic benefit from this or any other cruise deal—we have seen a negative benefit, and that is traffic, unwieldy, businesses closing because workers can’t get there, honking, car crashes.' The bill also demands traffic mitigation plans for cruise departures. Residents and advocates say the city’s cruise terminals bring only pollution, congestion, and risk to vulnerable road users.

The truckpocalypse rolls on.</p><p class=mb3>City Council Member Alexa Avilés led a bill last year requiring New York City to redesign Red Hook’s truck routes and submit a report by September 2024. The bill responds to a surge in last-mile warehouses, with trucks and vans now making up nearly 21 percent of Van Brunt Street traffic. The matter summary states, 'requiring the city to redesign its truck route and submit a report by September 2024.' Avilés sponsored the bill; three more bills for further study remain stalled. Locals call the influx a 'truckpocalypse.' Residents and advocates warn of rising pollution and danger for people on foot and bike. The city’s slow response leaves vulnerable road users exposed as warehouse traffic grows unchecked.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger grows for all outside a car.</p><p class=mb3>On September 21, 2023, Council Members Alexa Avilés and Erik Bottcher introduced a bill targeting cruise ship traffic and pollution in Red Hook. The proposal, discussed at a City Council press conference, would require the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) to mandate shore power use and enforce traffic mitigation plans for cruise ships. Avilés declared, 'Our residents are suffocating and the city must act.' The bill responds to chaos caused by ships like the MSC Meraviglia, which brings thousands of passengers and vehicles, blocking streets and the B61 bus. Unlike other lines, MSC offers no shuttle, forcing more cars onto local roads. The EDC claims traffic has improved, but local counts and residents say otherwise. Businesses see little benefit. The bill aims to cut pollution and congestion, but the city has yet to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'DOT continues to ignore dangers it created on Brooklyn’s Fourth Ave,' centers on DOT’s decision to replace bike lanes with a second car lane, violating a city law that requires temporary bike lanes during such work. Council Members Lincoln Restler, Alexa Aviles, Shahana Hanif, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and groups like Bike New York and Transportation Alternatives sent a letter demanding the bike lane’s return and physical barriers to stop illegal parking on pedestrian islands. The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
