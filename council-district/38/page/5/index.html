They had the signal. Both died. Police cited unsafe speed and a red‑light run <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>from the crash report</a> (CrashID 4826750).</p><p>They were two of <strong>25 people killed</strong> on District 38 streets since Jan 1, 2022, with <strong>12 of them walking</strong> and <strong>4 biking</strong>, according to NYC’s crash database <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>for this area and period</a>. Another 3,390 were hurt.</p><p>Speed and signals show up in the worst cases. The 52nd Street double fatal listed both “Unsafe Speed” and “Traffic Control Disregarded.” Failure to yield killed a 70‑year‑old woman in a left‑turn crash at 44th Street and Seventh Avenue on Jan 13, 2025 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the same dataset</a> (CrashID 4785620). A 30‑year‑old man was struck and killed by a box truck on Fourth Avenue at 60th Street on Nov 15, 2024 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>per the record</a> (CrashID 4771639).</p><h3 id=third-and-fourth-where-the-bodies-fall>Third and Fourth: where the bodies fall</h3><p>The district’s hot spots are plain. Fourth Avenue has seen 5 deaths and 259 injuries since 2022. Third Avenue has at least 1 death and 169 injuries in the same span, per NYC Open Data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>for this area</a>. The Gowanus/BQE corridors add more.</p><p>Sunset Park leaders have been begging for fixes on Third Avenue. “The Third Avenue corridor has been ‘persistently dangerous,’” Council Member <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/sunset-park-urges-city-to-fast-track-third-avenue-street-fixes-10986450>Alexa Avilés said</a>. “We have the tools to majorly reduce this violence, but it&rsquo;s up to the mayor&rsquo;s office to use them.”</p><p>At a rally after another hit‑and‑run on the corridor, Avilés pressed again for movement and money to match the danger, calling for “real political will and real capital investment” <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/advocates-slam-third-avenue-safety-delay/>on the record</a>.</p><h3 id=the-clock-says-go-the-street-says-stop>The clock says go; the street says stop</h3><p>This isn’t a blip. The district logged 5 deaths and 735 injuries so far this year, up from 651 injuries at this point last year, with crashes also higher, according to the same city data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>for this geography</a>.</p><p>Deaths stack at certain hours. The worst single hours include 9 AM and 3 PM, with 3 deaths each across the period, and 2 AM also showing 3, per the district’s time‑of‑day breakdown <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the dataset</a>. People walk and bike then. Drivers turn then. The pattern holds.</p><h3 id=fix-whats-killing-people-here>Fix what’s killing people here</h3><p>The crash data show named, fixable causes. “Failure to Yield” is tied to fatal turning crashes in the district (e.g., CrashID 4785620). “Traffic Control Disregarded” appears in multiple deaths, including the double fatal at 52nd and Third (CrashID 4826750), per NYC Open Data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>records</a>.</p><p>Local tools are known:</p><ul><li>Daylighting. Avilés co‑sponsors a bill to ban parking near crosswalks and build 1,000 daylighted corners a year <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138‑2024</a>. Keeping sightlines clear saves lives.</li><li>Hardened turns and LPIs at Third and Fourth Avenue crossings. The left‑turn death at 44th and Seventh shows the need <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4785620</a>. The corridors carry the harm totals above.</li><li>Clear the junk. Avilés voted yes on faster removal of derelict cars that block views and space <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857‑2024</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=the-citywide-levers-that-end-repeats>The citywide levers that end repeats</h3><p>Two steps can cut the next 52nd and Third off at the knees:</p><ul><li>Lower speeds citywide and on these corridors. The tools exist. Use them. Our action guide lays out how to push the limit down and keep speed cameras humming <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</li><li>Stop repeat speeders. Mandate intelligent speed assistance for drivers who rack up camera tickets. The state bill is written. Tell your legislators to move it <a href=/take_action/>now</a>.</li></ul><p>Avilés has sided with safety on multiple bills <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>on the Council docket</a>. Your Albany delegation for this area is Assembly Member Lester Chang and State Senator Steve Chan. Their support on the speed‑limiter bill is not listed in the record above. They can fix that today.</p><p>The men at 52nd and Third had the light. The car didn’t stop. Hold the line where they fell. Then lower the speed. Start <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
