Over 3,100 injured.</strong> Twenty-eight left with wounds so deep they are called serious injuries. These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children. They are the man crushed crossing 4th Avenue, the woman struck down by a turning sedan, the cyclist thrown from his bike. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><p>Just days ago, two men were killed at 52nd Street and Third Avenue. A BMW ran the red, hit them, and sped away. Police found the driver later. The bodies stayed behind. &ldquo;EMS pronounced both men dead at the scene. Their identities are being withheld pending family notification,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pedestrians-hit-and-run-brooklyn/>reported amNY</a>. The corner where they died has seen <strong>59 crashes and 80 injuries in five years</strong>—a slow-motion slaughter.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> Cars and trucks did most of the killing: 5 deaths, 248 minor injuries, 121 moderate, 7 serious. Motorcycles and mopeds took more. Bikes left dozens hurt. The old, the young, the ones on foot—they are the ones who die first. The street is not fair.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-stalled>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Stalled</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has backed bills to clear abandoned cars, fix curbs, and daylight crosswalks—measures that help, but do not end the bloodshed. She voted yes to remove derelict vehicles within 72 hours, aiming to clear blocked sightlines and crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see bill summary</a>). She co-sponsored a law to ban parking near crosswalks, demanding the city install daylighting barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. But the bill sits in committee, waiting. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-voices-left-behind>The Voices Left Behind</h3><p>After the hit-and-run, the charges stacked up: manslaughter, negligent homicide, reckless driving. &ldquo;Florentino was charged with two counts each of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, leaving the scene of an accident without reporting, and reckless endangerment,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pedestrians-hit-and-run-brooklyn/>wrote amNY</a>. The law comes after the fact. The families are left with silence.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the Council delays, another family is broken. Call Council Member Avilés. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
