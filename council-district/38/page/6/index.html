Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 3,000 hurt since 2022. In the last year alone, three more lives ended. Nine more people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead are old and young. A 70-year-old woman struck crossing with the signal. A 30-year-old man crushed by a truck. An 82-year-old killed by a motorcycle. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most damage.</strong> They killed at least five, left over 120 with moderate or serious injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, injured four. Bikes hurt ten. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, the old, the young—pay the price. The drivers keep moving.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has taken steps. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills</a> to ban parking near crosswalks, add speed humps, and toughen penalties for sidewalk parking. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/03/02/streetsblog-gets-action-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-lithium-ion-bills-advance-in-council>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-action-fourth-avenue-cyclist-killed/>joined calls for protected bike lanes</a> on Fourth Avenue after another cyclist was killed. But the danger remains. Promised safety upgrades stall. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/18/dot-continues-to-ignore-dangers-it-created-on-brooklyns-4th-ave>Bike lanes vanish during construction</a>. The city drags its feet while people die. <strong>Every delay is another body.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. But only if leaders act. Only if residents demand it. Call Council Member Avilés. Call the Mayor. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted crosswalks, and lower speed limits. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren.

Cyclists remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On October 20, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced it would not install a temporary protected bike lane on Brooklyn’s Fourth Avenue during major construction, despite Local Law 124 requiring such measures when bike lanes are blocked. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, who once supported the law as a council member, now claims a protected lane would worsen traffic and turning conflicts. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Alexa Aviles criticized the decision, with Reynoso stating, 'protected bike lanes are essential,' and Aviles urging the city to 'install an alternative, fully protected bike lane where the road can accommodate one.' Advocates argue the shared lane is unsafe and often blocked by cars. The DOT’s move prioritizes vehicle flow over cyclist safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measures, revived in committee, seek to redesign truck routes and gather data on facilities run by Amazon, FedEx, and UPS. The matter aims to 'reduce congestion and emissions, improve safety and increase visibility,' especially in overburdened neighborhoods like Red Hook and Sunset Park. Avilés, the lead sponsor, calls for systematic changes: 'We really need to look systematically at more improved routes to ensure people are safe.' The bills would require the Department of Transportation to daylight intersections and the Department of Environmental Protection to install air monitors on heavy-use roads. Councilwoman Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsors a related bill for public truck-route data. The legislation draws support from industry and advocates, all seeking safer streets and cleaner air for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It also pushes for 80% of deliveries in maritime areas to use marine transport, and encourages deliveries by foot, bike, and rail. Aviles and advocates demand a full land-use review (ULURP) for new sites. Existing warehouses are exempt. Kevin Garcia, an advocate, said, 'We want to reduce the number of cars and trucks that are leaving the facility.'

The matter summary warns that a blanket ban 'would worsen the city’s homelessness crisis by forcing residents to choose between a roof over their head and a job, and still not solve the problem of lithium-ion batteries catching fire.' Council Member Alexa Avilés called for a citywide approach. Tenant leader Cynthia Tibbs and Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project also oppose the ban, urging secure charging hubs. Senator Chuck Schumer highlighted federal funding for safer infrastructure. The public can comment on the NYCHA policy until September 6.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to "prohibit the issuance of private vehicle parking permits and revoke such existing permits," with exceptions for people with disabilities and collective bargaining agreements. Council Member Christopher Marte led as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Brewer, Joseph, Nurse, Cabán, Avilés, Bottcher, Won, Ossé, and Richardson Jordan, plus the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aimed to end a system that let private cars claim curb space, fueling illegal parking and danger for those on foot or bike. It was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. The status quo remains: permits still shield drivers, while vulnerable road users face the risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Kids’ lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On June 1, 2022, New York City Council members held a press conference in response to a Streetsblog report exposing high crash rates near schools. The event, not tied to a specific bill, saw Council Members Jennifer Gutiérrez, Julie Menin, Alexa Avilés, and Carlina Rivera demand urgent safety upgrades. The matter summary reads: 'City lawmakers and transportation and education advocates expressed outrage over a recent Streetsblog report on dangerous school streets, demanding the city do more to prevent drivers from harming children outside schools.' Lawmakers called the findings 'egregious' and 'unconscionable.' They urged more crossing guards, traffic calming, and car-free hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez signaled openness to restricting cars during key times. The council’s stance is clear: the city’s inaction puts children, especially those of color, at deadly risk. Lawmakers want swift, systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
