Five people died along it since 2022. The crash logs show 259 injured there too. The BQE and Gowanus feeder roads add more blood. Two deaths on the Brooklyn‑Queens Expressway. Two more along the Gowanus Expressway. The count keeps climbing in small lines of type.</p><p><strong>Since 2022: 24 people killed, 3,373 injured in District 38.</strong> Twelve were pedestrians. Four rode bikes. Heavy vehicles hit hard: trucks and buses figure in dozens of pedestrian injuries and two deaths. The worst hours stack up at school let‑out and the afternoon rush. Three deaths at 3 p.m. Two at 4 p.m. Another two at 1 p.m. The street doesn’t care.</p><h3 id=two-men-in-the-crosswalk-52nd-and-3rd>Two men in the crosswalk, 52nd and 3rd</h3><p>Before dawn on July 11, a 2011 BMW went south on 3rd Avenue and hit two people crossing with the signal at 52nd Street. Both died. The city record lists “Traffic Control Disregarded” and “Unsafe Speed.” It notes a right‑front bumper and two bodies broken. The line for each man ends the same: “Apparent Death.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Source</a>.</p><p>On 44th Street at 7th Avenue, a left‑turning Toyota struck a 70‑year‑old woman crossing with the signal. She died. The file calls it “Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way.” Another clean field, another life gone. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Source</a>.</p><h3 id=trucks-on-fourth-avenue-a-body-on-the-asphalt>Trucks on Fourth Avenue, a body on the asphalt</h3><p>At 4th Avenue and 60th Street, a box truck going straight crushed a 30‑year‑old man. He died where he fell. The form reads “Crush Injuries.” No damage noted for the truck. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Source</a>.</p><p>A 65‑year‑old man died on Columbia and Sigourney near the waterfront. Two box trucks in the file. One parked. One “Avoiding Object in Roadway.” The pedestrian’s entry says only “Apparent Death.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Source</a>.</p><h3 id=the-hot-streets-and-the-hot-hours>The hot streets and the hot hours</h3><p>Here, walking and biking draw blood. Pedestrians: 12 dead, 500 injured. Cyclists: 4 dead, 498 injured. SUVs and sedans lead the harm to people on foot. Trucks and buses are few but devastating. Fourth Avenue is a top danger zone. So are the BQE and Gowanus lanes feeding it. In the midday and afternoon, injuries spike. Three deaths at 9 a.m. Three more at noon and 3 p.m. Two at 4 p.m. Two at 1 p.m. The pattern is simple and cruel.</p><h3 id=what-city-hall-has--and-hasnt--done>What City Hall has — and hasn’t — done</h3><p>The Council moved some pieces. It passed a bill to remove derelict cars fast to clear sightlines and crosswalks. Your member voted yes. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Record</a>. Another law now requires warning decals in Ubers and taxis to help prevent doorings. Your member voted yes. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Record</a>. A daylighting bill to ban parking at crosswalk corners was laid over in committee, even as people kept dying at turns. Your member co‑sponsored it. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Record</a>.</p><p>Advocates point to the worst drivers. A small group does the most harm. “Just <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>1.5% of motorists cause 21% of pedestrian deaths</a>.” “<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>16 camera tickets in a year doubles the risk of killing or seriously injuring someone</a>,” and “<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>30+ multiplies it fifty‑fold</a>.”</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-slow-the-cars-stop-the-repeats>Fix the corners. Slow the cars. Stop the repeats.</h3><p>Concrete things save lives here:</p><ul><li>Daylight every corner on Fourth Avenue and the truck routes. Harden the turns. Install leading pedestrian intervals. The Council’s daylighting bill spells it out; it needs to move. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Bill history</a>.</li><li>Clear junked and illegal‑plate cars that block sightlines and crossings. The new derelict‑vehicle law is on the books; enforce it. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Law</a>.</li><li>Target trucks on Fourth, Third, and the BQE feeders. Enforce failure‑to‑yield and speeding at peak injury hours.</li></ul><p>Citywide, two steps would cut the harm that washed over 4th Avenue and 52nd Street:</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed. Slower cars mean survivors, not obituaries. The city now has the power to set safer limits, and advocates urge it to use it. <a href=/take_action/>Act now</a>.</li><li>Force the worst repeat speeders to obey the limit with speed limiters. The data on repeat offenders is clear. <a href=/take_action/>Details</a>.</li></ul><p>The forms keep filling. Names turn to numbers.
