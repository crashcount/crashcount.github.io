A BMW ran the red light and hit them. Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, died where they fell. The driver did not stop. He left behind broken glass and two bodies. Police found him later. He told them, “I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home,” according to the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>Neighbors say drivers speed on that stretch. “<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway</a>,” one neighbor told CBS. The city has known this for years. Still, the deaths keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, District 38 saw 1,552 crashes. Three people died. Eight suffered serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,000 were hurt. Most of the dead were older. Most were walking. Cars and SUVs killed five pedestrians in recent years. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed another. Bikes injured dozens, but did not kill.</p><p>This is not a new story. In five years, the three blocks around 52nd and 3rd saw 59 crashes and 80 injuries. The city calls them accidents. But the pattern is clear. The bodies pile up at the same corners.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Alexa Avilés has backed bills to make streets safer. She voted yes on the citywide greenway plan, which forces the city to map and maintain safer routes for people who walk and bike. She co-sponsored laws to ban parking near crosswalks, add speed humps, and legalize crossing mid-block—measures that help the vulnerable. She also called for more speed cameras and supported the SAFE Streets Act. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The council can demand more. So can you.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong> Call Council Member Avilés. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand action before another name is added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.
