Eighteen left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In District 43, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, 1,422 people have been hurt on these streets. The dead include the old, the young, the ones who did nothing but cross at the wrong time. A 95-year-old woman, Mayya Gil, was killed crossing Cropsey Avenue. She survived the Nazis, Chernobyl, and COVID. She did not survive a left turn by a cargo van. Police made no arrest. Her daughter said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was a very active lady.&rdquo;</a> The street took her anyway.</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, and mopeds all played their part.</strong> Cars and trucks killed two. Bikes killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left bodies broken. The violence is steady. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><h3 id=leadership-bills-delays-and-shifting-blame>Leadership: Bills, Delays, and Shifting Blame</h3><p>Council Member Susan Zhuang has acted, but not always for the vulnerable. She led a bill to put up school safety signs. Signs do not stop cars. She co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists, a law that shifts blame to the ones most at risk. She backed a bill to register e-bikes and scooters, another move that burdens those with the least power. She voted against ending jaywalking enforcement, keeping alive a law used to target the vulnerable. She did vote for greener medians, a step that may slow cars and shield walkers. But the record is clear: <strong>most bills do not touch the drivers or the speed.</strong></p><h3 id=the-human-cost-names-not-numbers>The Human Cost: Names, Not Numbers</h3><p>Mayya Gil is not a number. Her granddaughter said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was the kindest, most generous person I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo;</a> The city did not charge the driver. The street remains the same. The next name will come soon.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-than-words>What Now: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Call Susan Zhuang. Call City Hall. Demand real change.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people on foot and on bikes. End laws that blame the dead. <strong>Do not wait for another family to lose someone they love.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.
