Eighteen left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In District 43, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, 1,422 people have been hurt on these streets. The dead include the old, the young, the ones who did nothing but cross at the wrong time. A 95-year-old woman, Mayya Gil, was killed crossing Cropsey Avenue. She survived the Nazis, Chernobyl, and COVID. She did not survive a left turn by a cargo van. Police made no arrest. Her daughter said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was a very active lady.&rdquo;</a> The street took her anyway.</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, and mopeds all played their part.</strong> Cars and trucks killed two. Bikes killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left bodies broken. The violence is steady. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><h3 id=leadership-bills-delays-and-shifting-blame>Leadership: Bills, Delays, and Shifting Blame</h3><p>Council Member Susan Zhuang has acted, but not always for the vulnerable. She led a bill to put up school safety signs. Signs do not stop cars. She co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists, a law that shifts blame to the ones most at risk. She backed a bill to register e-bikes and scooters, another move that burdens those with the least power. She voted against ending jaywalking enforcement, keeping alive a law used to target the vulnerable. She did vote for greener medians, a step that may slow cars and shield walkers. But the record is clear: <strong>most bills do not touch the drivers or the speed.</strong></p><h3 id=the-human-cost-names-not-numbers>The Human Cost: Names, Not Numbers</h3><p>Mayya Gil is not a number. Her granddaughter said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was the kindest, most generous person I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo;</a> The city did not charge the driver. The street remains the same. The next name will come soon.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-than-words>What Now: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Call Susan Zhuang. Call City Hall. Demand real change.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people on foot and on bikes. End laws that blame the dead. <strong>Do not wait for another family to lose someone they love.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT offered no timeline. The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On September 6, 2023, advocates confronted the Department of Transportation (DOT) at a rules hearing over a city proposal to ban parking at curb cuts in T-shaped intersections. The proposal aims to close a 2009 loophole that lets drivers park in crosswalks at three-way junctions if unmarked or lacking signals. The matter summary reads: 'A city proposal to ban parking at curbs cuts in "T" intersections must go further by banning all parking at the edges of such intersections, advocates demanded.' Christine Serdjenian Yearwood, Jean Ryan, Rosamond Gianutsos, and Jackson Chabot spoke out, demanding a total ban and daylighting at all intersections. Advocates argue that parking at T intersections blocks visibility and endangers pedestrians, especially the disabled and children. DOT supports the rule change but gave no timeline. The city still overrides state law requiring 20 feet of clear space at crosswalks. The fight for safety continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, not yet finalized, will be discussed at a virtual hearing in early September. The matter summary states: 'The city wants to reverse a 2009 policy that allows drivers to park in unmarked crosswalks at T-intersections, undoing a decade-and-a-half giveaway to drivers that blocked pedestrian access and made streets less safe.' Former Council Member Vincent Gentile pushed for the original exemption, arguing it would create parking and increase safety. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno said, 'This proposed change will enhance safety and accessibility for pedestrians.' Disability and street safety advocates, including Jean Ryan, praised the move, saying the loophole blocked access for people with disabilities and endangered all pedestrians. The change will restore visibility at intersections, known as daylighting, and aligns city rules with state law requiring clear sight lines at crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, “The view was blocked.” All listed contributing factors are 'View Obstructed/Limited.' The data shows no other driver errors. The scooter rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the primary factor of obstructed view. No injuries were reported for the sedan occupants. The crash highlights the lethal risk when sightlines are blocked on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
