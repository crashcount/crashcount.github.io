Eighteen left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In District 43, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, 1,422 people have been hurt on these streets. The dead include the old, the young, the ones who did nothing but cross at the wrong time. A 95-year-old woman, Mayya Gil, was killed crossing Cropsey Avenue. She survived the Nazis, Chernobyl, and COVID. She did not survive a left turn by a cargo van. Police made no arrest. Her daughter said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was a very active lady.&rdquo;</a> The street took her anyway.</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, and mopeds all played their part.</strong> Cars and trucks killed two. Bikes killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left bodies broken. The violence is steady. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><h3 id=leadership-bills-delays-and-shifting-blame>Leadership: Bills, Delays, and Shifting Blame</h3><p>Council Member Susan Zhuang has acted, but not always for the vulnerable. She led a bill to put up school safety signs. Signs do not stop cars. She co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists, a law that shifts blame to the ones most at risk. She backed a bill to register e-bikes and scooters, another move that burdens those with the least power. She voted against ending jaywalking enforcement, keeping alive a law used to target the vulnerable. She did vote for greener medians, a step that may slow cars and shield walkers. But the record is clear: <strong>most bills do not touch the drivers or the speed.</strong></p><h3 id=the-human-cost-names-not-numbers>The Human Cost: Names, Not Numbers</h3><p>Mayya Gil is not a number. Her granddaughter said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was the kindest, most generous person I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo;</a> The city did not charge the driver. The street remains the same. The next name will come soon.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-than-words>What Now: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Call Susan Zhuang. Call City Hall. Demand real change.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people on foot and on bikes. End laws that blame the dead. <strong>Do not wait for another family to lose someone they love.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Cyclists and children face danger when lanes vanish. The city acted fast, without notice. The fight for safe passage on Bedford Avenue continues in court.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 18, 2025, that Judge Carolyn Walker-Diallo halted New York City's plan to remove three blocks of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The court found the city may have acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally" by ordering the removal without proper legal notice. City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children. The city claimed it would only shift the lane, not remove it, but advocates countered that any removal increases danger. The case highlights the need for transparent processes and the risks when safety infrastructure is hastily altered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lane calmed a deadly stretch. Drivers still parked illegally. Children darted into traffic. Now, cyclists and pedestrians face more danger. Policy shifts, safety slips. Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
