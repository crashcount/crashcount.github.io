These are not just numbers. Each one is a family left with a hole that will not close.</p><p>Just last month, an eight-year-old boy was killed at the corner of Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue. The SUV kept going. The boy never got up. Earlier this spring, a 55-year-old woman was crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue while crossing the street. She did not make it to the other side.</p><h2 id=the-blunt-edge-of-policy>The Blunt Edge of Policy</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs caused four of the five pedestrian deaths in this district. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds injured, but did not kill, any pedestrians. The street is a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><p>Neighbors know the danger. After a hit-and-run killed two men in Brooklyn, a neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said drivers speed on that stretch of roadway</a>. The city knows too. But the carnage continues.</p><h2 id=what-has-crystal-hudson-done>What Has Crystal Hudson Done?</h2><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has backed bills to clear abandoned vehicles from the street, to warn taxi passengers about opening doors into cyclists, and to demand curb extensions at dangerous intersections. She voted yes on laws to remove derelict cars within 72 hours and to require warning decals on for-hire vehicles. She co-sponsored a bill to force the city to build curb extensions at the most dangerous crossings. But many of these changes move slowly. Some are still stuck in committee. The street does not wait.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end the era of cars parked to the edge, blocking the view of a child stepping off the curb. But it will not happen unless you demand it. Call Council Member Hudson. Call the Mayor. Tell them to finish the job. Do not let another family join the count.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
