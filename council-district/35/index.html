Since January 2022, <strong>18 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>Forty-three more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The wounded are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last year alone, five families buried loved ones. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=the-latest-losses>The Latest Losses</h2><p>On May 17, a woman, 55, was killed by an SUV at Washington Avenue and Fulton Street. She was crossing, and the car crushed her body. On April 8, a 101-year-old woman was struck and killed by a left-turning SUV at Montgomery Street and Brooklyn Avenue. She was crossing with the signal. The driver did not yield. The city did not protect her. The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm</strong>. In this district, they account for <strong>4 deaths and 11 serious injuries to pedestrians</strong>. Trucks and buses killed one, left another with life-altering wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds, often untraceable, have injured and maimed. Bikes, too, have left their mark, but the carnage comes on four wheels more than two. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member <strong>Crystal Hudson has backed key safety bills</strong>. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless driving and demands safer design. She joined the push to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear sightlines for people crossing. But the crisis is not over. The bills are not enough. The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-voices-of-the-street>The Voices of the Street</h2><p>A witness saw the aftermath: &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said Mugsy</a>. Another neighbor, after a deadly moped hit-and-run, said, &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said Ryan Rivera</a>.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end the reign of repeat offenders. It can act now. <strong>Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action before another name becomes a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.'

The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp.

The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour.

The lawsuit says tying DOT money to immigration crackdowns endangers safety. Projects stall. Streets grow riskier. Immigrants fear reporting crimes. The federal move puts lives on the line.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, New York Attorney General Letitia James led a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration’s move to tie U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) funding to state cooperation with immigration enforcement. The suit, joined by other state attorneys general, challenges an April 24 announcement by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that would cut off funding to states refusing to enforce federal immigration law or maintain diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The matter summary states, 'DOT’s blatant overreach threatens to divert critical resources away from public safety and undermine projects that keep our communities connected and safe.' James and her colleagues argue this policy forces states to choose between billions in infrastructure funds and supporting immigrant communities. They warn that withholding funds will halt vital safety projects, making streets and transit more dangerous. The attorneys general also note that immigrants may avoid reporting crimes if they fear deportation, further undermining public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
