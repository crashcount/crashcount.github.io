An SUV struck him as he crossed. The record shows only the facts: head injury, death at the scene. No mention of a toy, no last words. Just a number—another child lost in Crown Heights. In the past year, five people have died on District 35 streets. Four were pedestrians. One was a child.</p><p>A 55-year-old woman was crushed by an SUV at Washington Avenue and Fulton Street. She was not at an intersection. She died there. The data is cold, but the loss is not. In the same year, 682 people were injured in crashes here. Nine suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-relentless-pattern>The Relentless Pattern</h3><p>The numbers do not lie. SUVs and cars are the main killers—five deaths, 426 injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, injured 28. Motorcycles and mopeds left no one dead, 23 injured. Bikes injured 29, but killed no one. The streets are not safe for the old or the young. The record is clear.</p><p>A witness saw a man struck by a moped. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>the witness said</a>. The rider wore a mask and fled. The old man was left behind.</p><p>A son watched his father die in the street. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. The driver fled. The family waited for a miracle that never came.</p><h3 id=council-member-hudson-action-and-gaps>Council Member Hudson: Action and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills</a> to daylight intersections, expand protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking—measures that shift blame away from victims and demand safer design. Hudson voted yes on the law that ended jaywalking tickets, making it clear: streets belong to people, not just cars. She backed the SAFE Streets Act and curb extensions to protect those on foot. But the carnage continues. No law has yet stopped the killing.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The disaster is slow, but it is not fate. Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers, not crackdowns on cyclists and pedestrians. Join with others. Refuse to let another child, another parent, become a number.</p><p>Act now. The blood on the street is not yet dry.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation will fine violators $650 per incident, using in-road sensors to detect excess weight. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Overweight trucks cause wear and tear on our roadways and we all pay the price through expensive repairs to our infrastructure." The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles.

Concrete islands promise safer crossings. Details remain thin. Cars may still block buses. The street could change. Pedestrians and riders wait. The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety, not speed, takes the street.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-06) reports the Department of Transportation will install a protected bike lane on Brooklyn’s Court Street, a corridor plagued by double parking and sideswipe crashes. DOT’s Chris Brunson said, “The narrower street width for vehicles will de-incentivize double parking on the corridor.” The redesign removes a travel lane, adds a protected bike lane, and aims to curb driver behavior that leads to crashes. Between 2022 and 2024, 165 crashes on this mile-long stretch caused one death and injured 15 cyclists and 23 pedestrians. Most pedestrian injuries happened while crossing with the light, showing drivers failed to yield. The plan targets excess road capacity and prioritizes vulnerable users on a Vision Zero Priority Corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule.

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses.

The suit, joined by other state attorneys general, challenges an April 24 announcement by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that would cut off funding to states refusing to enforce federal immigration law or maintain diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The matter summary states, 'DOT’s blatant overreach threatens to divert critical resources away from public safety and undermine projects that keep our communities connected and safe.' James and her colleagues argue this policy forces states to choose between billions in infrastructure funds and supporting immigrant communities. They warn that withholding funds will halt vital safety projects, making streets and transit more dangerous. The attorneys general also note that immigrants may avoid reporting crimes if they fear deportation, further undermining public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
