Ten maimed.</strong> In the past year, District 35 has seen 1,279 crashes. <strong>Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</strong> A 101-year-old woman was killed crossing with the light at Montgomery and Brooklyn. A 55-year-old woman was crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue. A man, 39, died under the wheels of a truck on Atlantic. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unprotected>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unprotected</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.</strong> In three years, they took at least four lives and left dozens broken. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles and mopeds added to the toll. Bikes, too, but the numbers are small. The street is a gauntlet. The sidewalk is no refuge.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-taken-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Taken, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has not stood still. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require curb extensions</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>expand protected bike lanes</a>. She backed the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act</a>, calling for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims.</p><p>But the city drags its feet. On Atlantic Avenue, the most dangerous road in the borough, Hudson and others demanded a redesign. The city offered paint and promises. &ldquo;Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/29/bp-reynoso-dot-must-open-its-street-safety-toolkit-on-atlantic-ave>said Borough President Reynoso</a>. Hudson acknowledged the need, but the road diet waits. The danger does not.</p><h2 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. The city has the tools. The council has the votes. The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is policy, written in steel and speed.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Hudson. Call the Mayor. Demand a real redesign of Atlantic Avenue. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and a 20 mph speed limit.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The dead cannot speak.

Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race.

The new design 'daylights' corners, using concrete, granite, and planters to keep cars back and create mini-protected bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The agency targeted intersections with a history of turning crashes—Ocean Avenue saw 79 crashes in 2024, injuring 75 people, including 15 pedestrians and 13 cyclists. Advocates praised the move but called for faster, broader use of hard infrastructure. The article notes that most pedestrian injuries and deaths in New York occur at intersections, and that keeping corners clear is standard in other states.

The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour.

Ossé (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, and Tiffany Cabán back the measure. The cards, handed out by NYPD union members, let friends and relatives skirt penalties for traffic violations. The practice breeds unequal enforcement.
