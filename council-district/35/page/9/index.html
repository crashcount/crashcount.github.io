Forty-three have been seriously hurt.</strong> The dead include a 101-year-old woman crossing with the light, a 39-year-old man crushed on Atlantic Avenue, and a 55-year-old woman struck on Washington Avenue. These are not numbers. They are lives ended and families broken.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the killing.</strong> SUVs alone took three lives and left hundreds injured. Trucks, vans, and buses added more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, left bodies in their wake. Bikes hurt, but they did not kill.</p><h2 id=the-latest-blood-on-the-asphalt>The Latest Blood on the Asphalt</h2><p>The carnage does not slow. In May, a 55-year-old woman was killed by an SUV on Washington Avenue. She was not at an intersection. She did not stand a chance. In April, a 101-year-old woman died crossing with the signal at Brooklyn Avenue. The driver was unlicensed. The car was an SUV. The law did not save her. The street did not save her. No one did. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h2><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has taken some steps. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require curb extensions</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>. She backed the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act</a>, which targets reckless driving and demands safer design.</p><p>But the city moves slow. Atlantic Avenue remains a death trap. Hudson has called for change, but the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>Department of Transportation delays</a>. &ldquo;Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum,&rdquo; said Borough President Reynoso, as Hudson <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/29/bp-reynoso-dot-must-open-its-street-safety-toolkit-on-atlantic-ave>acknowledged the need for safety</a> but stopped short of demanding a full redesign.</p><h2 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h2><p><strong>Every delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Hudson.

The legislation, discussed in the City Council, exempts NYPD, news, and hospital helicopters. The bill’s matter title: 'Stop the Chop.' Council Members Amanda Farias, Gale Brewer, Shahana Hanif, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Christopher Marte, and Carlina Rivera joined as sponsors. Hanif stated, 'Our airspace is not for sale to the highest bidder and should only be available to essential needs of our city.' The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution. The proposal aims to cut thousands of flights, reduce greenhouse gases, and restore peace to city parks and neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, 'This policy is discriminatory and ableist, and harmful to climate goals.' Hanif notes e-bikes enabled her to ride after hip surgery. The ban forces riders onto dangerous streets, blocks access for families and people with limited mobility, and invites selective NYPD enforcement. The council members urge Mayor Adams to lift the ban, arguing it closes the park to those who need safe, accessible routes most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

Hudson, who has supported open space and pedestrian safety, now emphasizes community engagement, saying, 'Every voice, including dissenting voices, must be heard.' She suggests changes to better accommodate all residents. Data shows the open street is safer, with fewer crashes and more non-drivers using the space.
