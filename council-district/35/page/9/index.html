Seventy-five percent of tickets hit them, though they make up half the city. Advocates say this policing is dangerous. Calls grow to shift enforcement from police to transportation officials.</p><p class=mb3>On January 4, 2022, Streetsblog NYC reported that NYPD’s racial bias in ticketing cyclists continued through 2021. From January to September, 75 percent of tickets for cycling infractions went to Black and Latinx New Yorkers, despite these groups making up about half the city’s population and cycling public. The article quotes Wesley Caines of The Bronx Defenders, who compared this enforcement to stop-and-frisk, and Jackie Gosdigian of Brooklyn Defender Services, who called it 'racist Broken Windows policing.' Advocates urge the removal of NYPD from traffic enforcement, pushing for oversight by the Department of Transportation. A City Council bill to decriminalize jaywalking stalled in committee and awaits resubmission. The NYPD denies bias, but new rules will require them to log race and gender in stops. The ongoing pattern puts vulnerable road users at risk of police violence and systemic harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
