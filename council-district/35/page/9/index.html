The legislation, discussed in the City Council, exempts NYPD, news, and hospital helicopters. The bill’s matter title: 'Stop the Chop.' Council Members Amanda Farias, Gale Brewer, Shahana Hanif, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Christopher Marte, and Carlina Rivera joined as sponsors. Hanif stated, 'Our airspace is not for sale to the highest bidder and should only be available to essential needs of our city.' The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution. The proposal aims to cut thousands of flights, reduce greenhouse gases, and restore peace to city parks and neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, 'This policy is discriminatory and ableist, and harmful to climate goals.' Hanif notes e-bikes enabled her to ride after hip surgery. The ban forces riders onto dangerous streets, blocks access for families and people with limited mobility, and invites selective NYPD enforcement.
