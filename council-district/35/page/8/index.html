The old and the young fall first.</p><p>The wounds are not numbers.

The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

The officer, accused of speeding and running a red light, was placed on modified duty. The Internal Affairs Bureau and the state Attorney General opened investigations. The NYPD refused to release crash details or the officer's name. Council Member Crystal Hudson issued a blistering statement demanding the officer's termination, not desk duty. The matter summary states, 'The police officer who was driving the NYPD vehicle that fatally struck a man...has been placed on modified duty.' The NYPD's lack of transparency is routine. Truths surface only after lawsuits. In 2020, vehicle crashes cost the city $142 million. Police settlements are a heavy burden. The system shields its own, leaving families to seek answers in court.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s summary reads: “notification and community input regarding designation of, removal of and changes to open streets.” Sponsors included Tiffany Cabán (primary), Crystal Hudson, Kamillah Hanks, Oswald Feliz, Farah N.

The bill mandated a four-week comment window and a two-week response period, plus annual reporting and advance notice for temporary changes.

From January to September, 75 percent of tickets for cycling infractions went to Black and Latinx New Yorkers, despite these groups making up about half the city’s population and cycling public. The article quotes Wesley Caines of The Bronx Defenders, who compared this enforcement to stop-and-frisk, and Jackie Gosdigian of Brooklyn Defender Services, who called it 'racist Broken Windows policing.' Advocates urge the removal of NYPD from traffic enforcement, pushing for oversight by the Department of Transportation. A City Council bill to decriminalize jaywalking stalled in committee and awaits resubmission. The NYPD denies bias, but new rules will require them to log race and gender in stops.
