The driver remained at the scene and was not charged. The NYPD released little information, citing the Department of Transportation’s oversight of the Collision Investigation Squad. This fatality comes weeks after another deadly crash nearby involving a police officer. Attorney General Letitia James has opened a review of that earlier case. Smith’s sister criticized the NYPD for withholding information.

It called on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to ensure any subway station undergoing enhancement or renovation becomes fully accessible to people with disabilities. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make any subway stations undergoing enhancement or renovation fully accessible to people with disabilities.' Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the resolution, joined by Brannan, Menin, Louis, Yeger, Hanif, Hudson, Marte, Joseph, Riley, and Brooks-Powers. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Only 117 out of 493 subway stations are accessible. The Council’s action highlights the city’s failure to guarantee safe, equal passage for all riders. Elevators and upgrades are overdue. The bill’s filing leaves vulnerable New Yorkers waiting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure urges passage of S.4037/A.5896, which would 'extend and expand the scope of the MTA On-Demand E-Hail Paratransit Pilot Program.' Council Member Justin L. Brannan led sponsorship, joined by Ayala, Menin, Louis, Hanif, Hudson, Bottcher, Farías, Brooks-Powers, and Brewer. The resolution slams service caps and fare surcharges, calling them 'inequitable and unjust.' It demands that paratransit users get the same fare, hours, and ride freedom as subway and bus riders. The bill would end rationing and financial barriers for disabled New Yorkers who rely on Access-A-Ride. The Council’s action highlights the systemic barriers faced by vulnerable road users and presses for equal, unrestricted access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seventy-five percent of tickets hit them, though they make up half the city. Advocates say this policing is dangerous. Calls grow to shift enforcement from police to transportation officials.</p><p class=mb3>On January 4, 2022, Streetsblog NYC reported that NYPD’s racial bias in ticketing cyclists continued through 2021. From January to September, 75 percent of tickets for cycling infractions went to Black and Latinx New Yorkers, despite these groups making up about half the city’s population and cycling public. The article quotes Wesley Caines of The Bronx Defenders, who compared this enforcement to stop-and-frisk, and Jackie Gosdigian of Brooklyn Defender Services, who called it 'racist Broken Windows policing.' Advocates urge the removal of NYPD from traffic enforcement, pushing for oversight by the Department of Transportation. A City Council bill to decriminalize jaywalking stalled in committee and awaits resubmission. The NYPD denies bias, but new rules will require them to log race and gender in stops. The ongoing pattern puts vulnerable road users at risk of police violence and systemic harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
