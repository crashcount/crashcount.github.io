Ten maimed.</strong> In the past year, District 35 has seen 1,279 crashes. <strong>Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</strong> A 101-year-old woman was killed crossing with the light at Montgomery and Brooklyn. A 55-year-old woman was crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue. A man, 39, died under the wheels of a truck on Atlantic. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unprotected>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unprotected</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.</strong> In three years, they took at least four lives and left dozens broken. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles and mopeds added to the toll. Bikes, too, but the numbers are small. The street is a gauntlet. The sidewalk is no refuge.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-taken-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Taken, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has not stood still. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require curb extensions</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>expand protected bike lanes</a>. She backed the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act</a>, calling for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims.</p><p>But the city drags its feet. On Atlantic Avenue, the most dangerous road in the borough, Hudson and others demanded a redesign. The city offered paint and promises. &ldquo;Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/29/bp-reynoso-dot-must-open-its-street-safety-toolkit-on-atlantic-ave>said Borough President Reynoso</a>. Hudson acknowledged the need, but the road diet waits. The danger does not.</p><h2 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. The city has the tools. The council has the votes. The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is policy, written in steel and speed.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Hudson. Call the Mayor. Demand a real redesign of Atlantic Avenue. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and a 20 mph speed limit.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div></div><div class="mod-contact tc"><h3 class="fw6 mb2">Fix the Problem</h3><button class="dib pv2 ph3 ba b--light-silver br2 bg-dark-gray white pointer" onclick='var el=document.getElementById("contact-card");el.classList.toggle("dn"),el.classList.toggle("flex")'>

Instead, DOT scrapped the one-way conversion and neckdowns, citing 'community feedback' and resource limits. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, 'the project honoring Baby Apolline still creates new public space and safer streets,' but for now, only the Gates Plaza will move ahead. Council Member Crystal Hudson said she was not informed in advance and focused on advocating for the garden. The rollback means fewer protections for pedestrians and leaves the street’s dangers largely unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
