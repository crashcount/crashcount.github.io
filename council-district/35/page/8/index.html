These are not just numbers. Each one is a family left with a hole that will not close.</p><p>Just last month, an eight-year-old boy was killed at the corner of Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue. The SUV kept going. The boy never got up. Earlier this spring, a 55-year-old woman was crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue while crossing the street. She did not make it to the other side.</p><h2 id=the-blunt-edge-of-policy>The Blunt Edge of Policy</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs caused four of the five pedestrian deaths in this district. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds injured, but did not kill, any pedestrians. The street is a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><p>Neighbors know the danger. After a hit-and-run killed two men in Brooklyn, a neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said drivers speed on that stretch of roadway</a>. The city knows too. But the carnage continues.</p><h2 id=what-has-crystal-hudson-done>What Has Crystal Hudson Done?</h2><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has backed bills to clear abandoned vehicles from the street, to warn taxi passengers about opening doors into cyclists, and to demand curb extensions at dangerous intersections. She voted yes on laws to remove derelict cars within 72 hours and to require warning decals on for-hire vehicles. She co-sponsored a bill to force the city to build curb extensions at the most dangerous crossings. But many of these changes move slowly. Some are still stuck in committee. The street does not wait.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end the era of cars parked to the edge, blocking the view of a child stepping off the curb. But it will not happen unless you demand it. Call Council Member Hudson. Call the Mayor. Tell them to finish the job. Do not let another family join the count.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police said the 41-year-old woman driving the black 2014 Mercedes GL 550 'came into contact' with the pedestrian. He suffered severe head trauma and died at Kings County Hospital. The driver remained at the scene and was not charged. The NYPD released little information, citing the Department of Transportation’s oversight of the Collision Investigation Squad. This fatality comes weeks after another deadly crash nearby involving a police officer. Attorney General Letitia James has opened a review of that earlier case. Smith’s sister criticized the NYPD for withholding information.

The officer, accused of speeding and running a red light, was placed on modified duty. The Internal Affairs Bureau and the state Attorney General opened investigations. The NYPD refused to release crash details or the officer's name. Council Member Crystal Hudson issued a blistering statement demanding the officer's termination, not desk duty. The matter summary states, 'The police officer who was driving the NYPD vehicle that fatally struck a man...has been placed on modified duty.' The NYPD's lack of transparency is routine. Truths surface only after lawsuits. In 2020, vehicle crashes cost the city $142 million. Police settlements are a heavy burden. The system shields its own, leaving families to seek answers in court.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seventy-five percent of tickets hit them, though they make up half the city. Advocates say this policing is dangerous. Calls grow to shift enforcement from police to transportation officials.</p><p class=mb3>On January 4, 2022, Streetsblog NYC reported that NYPD’s racial bias in ticketing cyclists continued through 2021. From January to September, 75 percent of tickets for cycling infractions went to Black and Latinx New Yorkers, despite these groups making up about half the city’s population and cycling public. The article quotes Wesley Caines of The Bronx Defenders, who compared this enforcement to stop-and-frisk, and Jackie Gosdigian of Brooklyn Defender Services, who called it 'racist Broken Windows policing.' Advocates urge the removal of NYPD from traffic enforcement, pushing for oversight by the Department of Transportation. A City Council bill to decriminalize jaywalking stalled in committee and awaits resubmission. The NYPD denies bias, but new rules will require them to log race and gender in stops. The ongoing pattern puts vulnerable road users at risk of police violence and systemic harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
