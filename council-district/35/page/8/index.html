In the last twelve months, four people were killed and nine suffered serious injuries in crashes. Nearly 700 were hurt. The dead include a 101-year-old woman crossing with the light, a 55-year-old man mowed down at midnight, and a woman struck after stepping out of a taxi. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p>On April 8, Taibel Brod tried to cross Brooklyn Avenue with the walk signal. An unlicensed driver turned left and hit her. She died in the hospital. Her son <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>recalled</a>, &ldquo;She walked every morning from Crown Heights to Brookdale Hospital. She used to feed patients there for many years.&rdquo;</p><p>A week later, a man tried to cross Washington Avenue at Fulton. A Ford Explorer slammed into him and kept going. He died before sunrise. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>called it the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn in a week</a>.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-unkept-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Unkept Promises</h2><p>SUVs and cars did most of the killing. In three years, they caused more than three-quarters of pedestrian deaths and serious injuries here. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are wide. The signals are short. The danger is constant.</p><h2 id=the-response-what-crystal-hudson-has-doneand-not-done>The Response: What Crystal Hudson Has Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has backed bills to build protected bike lanes, daylight intersections, and legalize crossing mid-block. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to end jaywalking tickets</a> and co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act. She called for more crossing guards and curb extensions after a child was killed by a city tow truck. But when it came to Atlantic Avenue—the deadliest stretch—she stopped short of demanding a full redesign. The city <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>says to wait two more years for real change</a>. The bodies keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk. Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a full redesign of Atlantic Avenue, daylighting at every corner, and protected lanes where people walk and ride. Do not wait for another name to join the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) postponed its presentation on making the open street permanent after Hudson raised concerns. The matter summary states: 'implementation – especially the 'Limited Local Access' model – and communication... has been flawed.' Hudson, who has supported open space and pedestrian safety, now emphasizes community engagement, saying, 'Every voice, including dissenting voices, must be heard.' She suggests changes to better accommodate all residents. Data shows the open street is safer, with fewer crashes and more non-drivers using the space. Hudson’s stance highlights the tension between safety gains and demands for broader consensus.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The councilmembers cited ongoing crashes, injuries, and community complaints about dangerous conditions. They requested a comprehensive traffic study and highlighted support from over 2,000 neighbors and local advocacy groups. DOT responded that it would review the letter and meet with the community. The push comes as past improvements have failed to end the threat to pedestrians and cyclists.

Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began.

Most neighbors backed the car-free stretch.</p><p class=mb3>On March 8, 2022, Councilmember Crystal Hudson hosted a heated debate on the Willoughby Avenue open street in District 35. The meeting followed the abrupt, unannounced removal of barriers from the eight-block stretch, which sparked swift backlash. Hudson, joined by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez, faced vocal opponents worried about lost parking and emergency access. Hudson said, 'This is about more than just open streets, this is about safe streets.' DOT surveys showed 88 percent support for permanent safety changes. Mayor Eric Adams ordered the street restored after learning Hudson opposed its closure. Rodríguez highlighted a spike in traffic deaths, noting, 'We have a responsibility to think about, first of all, protecting our senior citizens.' According to NYC Crash Mapper, 72 people—mostly cyclists and motorists—were injured on this stretch in the past decade, but no deaths. The open streets program, launched during the pandemic, remains popular and aims to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They want special permits to drop parking. They say parking rules drive up costs, block affordable homes, and fuel car use. The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) removed the open street, later calling it a 'miscommunication.' Adams stated, 'I called [DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez] and I stated, is this something [the neighborhood's] Councilwoman wants? And once I was told no, I was very clear, put that street back.' Officer Evita Poole of the NYPD’s 88th Precinct raised concerns about emergency vehicle access but denied lobbying for removal. Council Member Carlina Rivera, author of the permanent open streets law, tweeted support. Council Member Crystal Hudson promised a community meeting. The open street was restored the same day, but the incident left residents shaken and highlighted the fragility of safe space for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
