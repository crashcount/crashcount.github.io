Hanif (primary), Julie Menin, and Crystal Hudson. The bill orders the city to find intersections with the most pedestrian crashes and install curb extensions—no parking within 15 feet of crosswalks—at five sites per borough, every year. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law...requiring curb extensions at certain dangerous intersections.' Curb extensions force cars back, clear sight lines, and keep walkers in view. The sponsors push city agencies to act, not wait. The bill demands oversight and speed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
