In the last year, four people died. Nine more suffered serious injuries. The toll is not numbers. It is a 101-year-old woman, struck in the crosswalk by an unlicensed driver. It is a 55-year-old man, killed crossing Washington Avenue by a driver who did not stop. It is a woman stepping from a taxi on Flatbush, hit before she could reach the curb. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><p>&ldquo;She walked every morning from Crown Heights to Brookdale Hospital. She used to feed patients there for many years,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>said her son</a>. The driver who killed her did not have a license. He was charged and released. The street did not change.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has signed her name to bills that could save lives. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the desperate and the slow. She co-sponsored laws to ban parking near crosswalks, require curb extensions, and demand more protected bike lanes. She called for a redesign of Atlantic Avenue, one of Brooklyn’s deadliest roads. But the city delays. The redesign is years away. The paint fades. The bodies do not move.</p><p>When the city swept away illegal placard parking, Hudson stood with the community. Cracking down on placard abuse reduces illegal parking, especially in bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks, improving safety and accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists by reclaiming public space and reducing driver entitlement, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>reported Streetsblog</a>.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p>Seventeen people have died on these streets since 2022. Hundreds more are hurt each year. Most are on foot or bike. Most are hit by cars, SUVs, or trucks. The laws are written. The votes are cast. The streets remain the same.</p><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another obituary. Call Council Member Hudson. Demand real change: daylight every crosswalk, redesign every deadly corridor, and end the delays. Join with others. Make them act.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, planned for over a year, aimed to add two-way protected bike lanes and convert some blocks to one-way for cars. According to Streetsblog, 'Officials from the Adams administration have held up part of yet another long-planned street redesign at the behest of a major local business opposed to part of the plan.' Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a top aide to Mayor Adams, reportedly ordered DOT to halt work after Two Trees Management, a powerful real estate company, lobbied against changes near its parking garage. Council member Crystal Hudson did not comment. DOT staff expressed frustration, saying such interference blocks progress for pedestrians and cyclists. The block near Two Trees remains without new markings, while other blocks move ahead.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23.
