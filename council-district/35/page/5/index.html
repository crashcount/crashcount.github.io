Forty-three more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In just the last twelve months, five families lost someone forever. One of them was a child. Another was over seventy-five. The old and the young fall first.</p><p>The wounds are not numbers.

The city moves on. The families do not.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-hudsons-record>What Has Been Done: Hudson’s Record</h3><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has not been silent. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a> and end the punishment of people on foot. She co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>expand curb extensions</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>.

Hanif, Hudson, and Menin push for concrete change. The bill’s language is blunt: visibility saves lives. City agencies must oversee and evaluate.

The suit alleges that Officers Orkhan Mamedov and Evan Siegel killed Smith by 'driving recklessly at nearly double the posted speed limit, at night, running red lights, in the wrong lane, with visibility limited by rain ... without justification or cause.' Smith was struck and killed while panhandling on Eastern Parkway. The officers, transporting prisoners, had no emergency but rushed to beat a shift change. Attorney David Rankin, representing the family, criticized the city's harsh treatment of victims' families, saying, 'The City of New York, in every instance where an employee kills somebody, puts the family and loved ones though a rigorous and unnecessarily brutal process.' Attorney General Letitia James cleared the officers of criminal charges but condemned their actions and called for NYPD procedural reform. The NYPD and city officials declined to comment further, while the family seeks both accountability and compensation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
