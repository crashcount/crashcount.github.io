Forty-three seriously hurt.</strong> More than 2,800 injured since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Pedestrians, cyclists, children. The youngest killed was eight. The oldest, 101. The street does not care.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a <strong>55-year-old woman was crushed by an SUV</strong> at Fulton and Washington. She died in the street. In June, an eight-year-old boy was killed at Eastern Parkway and Albany. The driver kept going straight. The boy never got up. The oldest victim, a woman of 101, was struck crossing with the signal. The driver failed to yield. She died at the scene. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices, policies, and the shape of our streets.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> Four deaths and over 400 injuries came from them. Trucks and buses killed one, hurt dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds, bikes—they injure, but the carnage comes on four wheels (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The stories do not end with the dead.

She voted yes on warning decals for taxis to prevent dooring, and for more transparent street safety reporting. But the bills move slow. The deaths do not wait.</p><p><strong>No law has yet forced a citywide 20 mph speed limit. No bill has ended the reign of repeat speeders.</strong> The city still lets cars park too close to crosswalks. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real daylighting at every intersection. Demand action, not delay.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

The author criticizes the Department of Transportation and city leaders for maintaining car dominance, rebuilding highways like the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, and failing to meet Vision Zero goals. The piece cites Attorney General Letitia James’s stance on truck depots and calls for NYC to follow cities like Helsinki and Oslo, which have eliminated pedestrian deaths.

James called the depot a potential 'public nuisance,' citing 'increased traffic, noise, vibrations, and local air pollution from trucks.' The matter, described as 'Attorney General James Says Harlem Truck Depot May Violate State Law,' centers on developer Bruce Teitelbaum’s project, which followed failed rezoning for affordable housing. Council Member Kristin Richardson Jordan and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams joined community members and Transportation Alternatives in opposition, arguing the depot 'will make our streets more dangerous.' Richardson Jordan thanked James for her support. The Attorney General’s office is considering legal action, echoing past interventions against similar depots.

The driver watched soccer on his phone. He struck Ronald Smith, dragged him 40 feet, and failed to help. The NYPD refused comment. Smith’s family demands the officers be fired and prosecuted. The city stays silent.</p><p class=mb3>On April 7, 2022, NYPD Officers Orkhan Mamedov and Evan Siegel drove a police van on Eastern Parkway during a non-emergency prisoner transfer. Surveillance and body camera footage, released by Attorney General Letitia James on December 19, 2022, shows the van speeding, running a red light, and striking Ronald Smith, a pedestrian. The van dragged Smith 35-40 feet. The matter summary states: 'Video shows cop speeding in NYPD van—and may have been watching a soccer game before fatal crash.' Smith’s sister, Julie Floyd, and Justice Committee director Yul-san Liem condemned the officers’ actions and inaction. Floyd called for their firing and prosecution, saying, 'These officers drove an NYPD van so fast and recklessly... they dragged my brother... and had no regard for my brother’s life.' The NYPD declined to comment or disclose the officers’ status. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
