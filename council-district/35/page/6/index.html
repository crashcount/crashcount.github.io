Since January 2022, <strong>18 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>Forty-three more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The wounded are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last year alone, five families buried loved ones. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=the-latest-losses>The Latest Losses</h2><p>On May 17, a woman, 55, was killed by an SUV at Washington Avenue and Fulton Street. She was crossing, and the car crushed her body. On April 8, a 101-year-old woman was struck and killed by a left-turning SUV at Montgomery Street and Brooklyn Avenue. She was crossing with the signal. The driver did not yield. The city did not protect her. The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm</strong>. In this district, they account for <strong>4 deaths and 11 serious injuries to pedestrians</strong>. Trucks and buses killed one, left another with life-altering wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds, often untraceable, have injured and maimed. Bikes, too, have left their mark, but the carnage comes on four wheels more than two. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member <strong>Crystal Hudson has backed key safety bills</strong>. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless driving and demands safer design. She joined the push to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear sightlines for people crossing. But the crisis is not over. The bills are not enough. The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-voices-of-the-street>The Voices of the Street</h2><p>A witness saw the aftermath: &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said Mugsy</a>. Another neighbor, after a deadly moped hit-and-run, said, &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said Ryan Rivera</a>.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end the reign of repeat offenders. It can act now. <strong>Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action before another name becomes a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city faces charges of wrongful death and calls for accountability.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2023, the family of Ronald Smith filed a wrongful death lawsuit against New York City in Brooklyn Supreme Court. The suit alleges that Officers Orkhan Mamedov and Evan Siegel killed Smith by 'driving recklessly at nearly double the posted speed limit, at night, running red lights, in the wrong lane, with visibility limited by rain ... without justification or cause.' Smith was struck and killed while panhandling on Eastern Parkway. The officers, transporting prisoners, had no emergency but rushed to beat a shift change. Attorney David Rankin, representing the family, criticized the city's harsh treatment of victims' families, saying, 'The City of New York, in every instance where an employee kills somebody, puts the family and loved ones though a rigorous and unnecessarily brutal process.' Attorney General Letitia James cleared the officers of criminal charges but condemned their actions and called for NYPD procedural reform. The NYPD and city officials declined to comment further, while the family seeks both accountability and compensation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

James called the depot a potential 'public nuisance,' citing 'increased traffic, noise, vibrations, and local air pollution from trucks.' The matter, described as 'Attorney General James Says Harlem Truck Depot May Violate State Law,' centers on developer Bruce Teitelbaum’s project, which followed failed rezoning for affordable housing. Council Member Kristin Richardson Jordan and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams joined community members and Transportation Alternatives in opposition, arguing the depot 'will make our streets more dangerous.' Richardson Jordan thanked James for her support. The Attorney General’s office is considering legal action, echoing past interventions against similar depots.
