In the last twelve months, four people were killed and nine suffered serious injuries in crashes. Nearly 700 were hurt. The dead include a 101-year-old woman crossing with the light, a 55-year-old man mowed down at midnight, and a woman struck after stepping out of a taxi. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p>On April 8, Taibel Brod tried to cross Brooklyn Avenue with the walk signal. An unlicensed driver turned left and hit her. She died in the hospital. Her son <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>recalled</a>, &ldquo;She walked every morning from Crown Heights to Brookdale Hospital. She used to feed patients there for many years.&rdquo;</p><p>A week later, a man tried to cross Washington Avenue at Fulton. A Ford Explorer slammed into him and kept going. He died before sunrise. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>called it the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn in a week</a>.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-unkept-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Unkept Promises</h2><p>SUVs and cars did most of the killing. In three years, they caused more than three-quarters of pedestrian deaths and serious injuries here. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are wide. The signals are short. The danger is constant.</p><h2 id=the-response-what-crystal-hudson-has-doneand-not-done>The Response: What Crystal Hudson Has Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has backed bills to build protected bike lanes, daylight intersections, and legalize crossing mid-block. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to end jaywalking tickets</a> and co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act. She called for more crossing guards and curb extensions after a child was killed by a city tow truck. But when it came to Atlantic Avenue—the deadliest stretch—she stopped short of demanding a full redesign. The city <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>says to wait two more years for real change</a>. The bodies keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk. Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a full redesign of Atlantic Avenue, daylighting at every corner, and protected lanes where people walk and ride. Do not wait for another name to join the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens.

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.

In response, the Department of Transportation (DOT) moved to create a pedestrian-only plaza between Vanderbilt Avenue and Fulton Street. Brooklyn Community Board 2 voted against the plan in August 2022, but DOT proceeded, as city law does not require board approval. The matter, described as a response to 'the tragedy and the desire to improve safety,' drew over 1,800 petition signatures. Council Member Crystal Hudson, representing District 35, supported the plaza for safety reasons. Despite public outreach and a scaled-back design, some longtime residents felt ignored. DOT promises further safety improvements. The plaza stands as a direct answer to deadly car violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort, not yet a formal bill, marks the start of a multiyear process with capital funding. The DOT presented plans to 'create more space for pedestrians and cyclists,' and floated ideas to connect Prospect Park’s northern entrance to the Soldiers Memorial Arch. Council Members Crystal Hudson and Shahana Hanif previously called for DOT to address 'signal timing and unprotected bike lanes.' Community advocates and residents voiced strong support for closing parts of the plaza to traffic and improving infrastructure for people walking and biking. The process includes public meetings, surveys, and a traffic study, with preliminary designs expected in 2024. While some residents worry about car access, the push is clear: less traffic, more safety for the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'NYC DOT proposal for car-free Grand Army Plaza and related street safety improvements,' is not a formal council bill but has drawn council attention. Council Member Shahana Hanif (District 39) and Crystal Hudson pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to address the plaza’s 'endless traffic, poor sidewalk conditions, broken benches, and overflowing trash cans.' Hanif and Hudson demanded immediate safety upgrades after recent crashes injured pedestrians and cyclists. DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton said, 'We want to take it to the next level... more consistent and better designed public spaces.' The agency is seeking public feedback and plans to draft detailed designs within the year. The proposal aims to end the status quo of danger and disrepair, prioritizing vulnerable road users over cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
