A woman, 55, died crossing Washington Avenue at Fulton. A 101-year-old woman was struck and killed in a crosswalk on Montgomery Street. In the last twelve months, five people have died and nine have suffered serious injuries in District 35. Children, elders, and working people pay the price.</p><p>The numbers do not stop.

The injured carry scars that do not heal.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm. They killed four people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes cause injuries, but they do not kill like the big machines. The street is not safe for anyone on foot or on two wheels. The risk is everywhere: at the curb, in the crosswalk, waiting for the light.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h3><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted yes on bills to remove abandoned vehicles</a> and require taxi dooring warnings. She has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored laws to daylight intersections</a> and build curb extensions, pushing for clear sight lines and fewer hiding places for danger. But many bills sit in committee, waiting. The city moves slow. The street does not wait.</p><p>Hudson has spoken out after police killed a man on Eastern Parkway. She demanded more than desk duty for the officer. &ldquo;These officers drove an NYPD van so fast and recklessly&mldr; they dragged my brother&mldr; and had no regard for my brother’s life,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/12/19/video-shows-cop-speeding-in-nypd-van-and-suggests-he-was-watching-a-soccer-game-before-fatal-crash>said the victim&rsquo;s sister</a>.

Demand action. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand that the city stop waiting for the next body. If you do not act, the numbers will keep rising.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The van sped, ran red lights, and struck Smith as he panhandled in the rain. The city faces charges of wrongful death and calls for accountability.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2023, the family of Ronald Smith filed a wrongful death lawsuit against New York City in Brooklyn Supreme Court. The suit alleges that Officers Orkhan Mamedov and Evan Siegel killed Smith by 'driving recklessly at nearly double the posted speed limit, at night, running red lights, in the wrong lane, with visibility limited by rain ... without justification or cause.' Smith was struck and killed while panhandling on Eastern Parkway. The officers, transporting prisoners, had no emergency but rushed to beat a shift change. Attorney David Rankin, representing the family, criticized the city's harsh treatment of victims' families, saying, 'The City of New York, in every instance where an employee kills somebody, puts the family and loved ones though a rigorous and unnecessarily brutal process.' Attorney General Letitia James cleared the officers of criminal charges but condemned their actions and called for NYPD procedural reform. The NYPD and city officials declined to comment further, while the family seeks both accountability and compensation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
