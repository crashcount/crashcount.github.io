Nine seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, District 35 has seen 1,271 crashes. Children, elders, and working people—no one is spared. An eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway with his sister. The driver stayed. The boy did not. “Yeah, this street is dangerous,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said a neighbor</a>.</p><p>A 101-year-old woman died in a crosswalk on Montgomery Street.

They are lives cut short, families broken, shoes left behind on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed five people and injured over 400 more on foot or bike. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll. The violence is relentless. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has backed bills to daylight crosswalks, build protected bike lanes, and legalize crossing mid-block. She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. Hudson called for a full redesign of Atlantic Avenue, one of Brooklyn’s deadliest roads, but the city stalled. “Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/29/bp-reynoso-dot-must-open-its-street-safety-toolkit-on-atlantic-ave>said Borough President Reynoso</a>. Hudson’s record shows support for safer streets, but the pace is slow. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted corners on every block. Demand action before another child’s name is written in chalk. The dead cannot call.

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights.

Jolyse Race of Riders Alliance stressed the economic justice at stake, noting bus riders earn half as much as car owners. Mayor Eric Adams has withheld support, citing community engagement and raising concerns about gentrification. The Department of Transportation's plans have stalled under his administration.

Introduced May 16, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to install pedestrian lighting on at least 25 step streets each year. The bill’s matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends. The measure targets a clear hazard: darkness on city stairs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized DOT for failing to meet bus and bike lane expansion mandates.

The coalition also disputes the DOT’s financial rationale, arguing the change will increase city costs due to extra staffing for barricades.
