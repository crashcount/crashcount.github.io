An SUV struck him as he crossed. The record shows only the facts: head injury, death at the scene. No mention of a toy, no last words. Just a number—another child lost in Crown Heights. In the past year, five people have died on District 35 streets. Four were pedestrians. One was a child.</p><p>A 55-year-old woman was crushed by an SUV at Washington Avenue and Fulton Street. She was not at an intersection. She died there. The data is cold, but the loss is not. In the same year, 682 people were injured in crashes here. Nine suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-relentless-pattern>The Relentless Pattern</h3><p>The numbers do not lie. SUVs and cars are the main killers—five deaths, 426 injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, injured 28. Motorcycles and mopeds left no one dead, 23 injured. Bikes injured 29, but killed no one. The streets are not safe for the old or the young. The record is clear.</p><p>A witness saw a man struck by a moped. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>the witness said</a>. The rider wore a mask and fled. The old man was left behind.</p><p>A son watched his father die in the street. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. The driver fled. The family waited for a miracle that never came.</p><h3 id=council-member-hudson-action-and-gaps>Council Member Hudson: Action and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills</a> to daylight intersections, expand protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking—measures that shift blame away from victims and demand safer design. Hudson voted yes on the law that ended jaywalking tickets, making it clear: streets belong to people, not just cars. She backed the SAFE Streets Act and curb extensions to protect those on foot. But the carnage continues. No law has yet stopped the killing.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The disaster is slow, but it is not fate. Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers, not crackdowns on cyclists and pedestrians. Join with others. Refuse to let another child, another parent, become a number.</p><p>Act now. The blood on the street is not yet dry.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
