The SUV did not stop in time.

In the last twelve months, District 35 saw <strong>4 deaths and 676 injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>Children, elders, and working people</strong>—no one is spared. SUVs and cars do most of the killing. In three years, <strong>17 people have died</strong> on these streets. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h3><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and legalize crossing mid-block. She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and pushed for curb extensions, daylighting, and better lighting. But on Atlantic Avenue, where four died and 473 were hurt in three years, the city delays real redesign. Hudson called for safety but stopped short of demanding a road diet. &ldquo;Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/29/bp-reynoso-dot-must-open-its-street-safety-toolkit-on-atlantic-ave>said Borough President Reynoso</a>.</p><p>On Empire Boulevard, Hudson’s office called a protected bike lane &ldquo;a necessary step to protect cyclists and pedestrians&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/26/community-board-calls-for-protected-bike-lane-on-empire-boulevard>after the community board demanded it</a>.

Call the Mayor. Tell them to finish the job: redesign deadly streets, lower speed limits, and protect every crossing. <strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The campaign, not tied to a specific council bill, has drawn support from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Rita Joseph. The matter, described as a 'no-brainer solution,' highlights slow bus speeds—often under 5 mph—and the urgent need for safer, faster transit. Jolyse Race of Riders Alliance stressed the economic justice at stake, noting bus riders earn half as much as car owners. Mayor Eric Adams has withheld support, citing community engagement and raising concerns about gentrification. The Department of Transportation's plans have stalled under his administration. Healthcare workers and union leaders spoke of missed shifts and unreliable service. Advocates now plan to survey bus riders to show support.

The board wants to upgrade the faded painted lane, which runs west to Flatbush Boulevard, to a 'vehicle-protected' lane. The matter summary states: 'bring much-needed road safety to a neighborhood.' Council Members Rita Joseph and Crystal Hudson represent the area. Hudson's spokesperson called the resolution 'a necessary step to protect cyclists and pedestrians.' Joseph and DOT did not comment. Between 2021 and 2023, Empire Boulevard saw 406 crashes, injuring 29 cyclists and 52 pedestrians. Two cyclists and two pedestrians have died since 2011. Community Board 9 has zero miles of protected bike lanes. Advocates say improvements are overdue. DOT has yet to propose changes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT claims, 'the revised hours will provide older New Yorkers and people with disabilities better street access while preserving the Open Street during its peak hours.' Council Member Crystal Hudson, a known supporter of livable streets, has not taken a clear stance but is monitoring the situation for safety. The Fort Greene Open Streets Coalition opposes the change, stating, 'Opening the street to vehicles during prime early morning hours and throughout the late evenings as the days grow longer will be an unfortunate mistake, and increases the potential for conflict with street safety impacts.' The coalition also disputes the DOT’s financial rationale, arguing the change will increase city costs due to extra staffing for barricades. The move reflects a broader city trend of reduced support for open streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
