Since January 2022, <strong>18 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>Forty-three more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The wounded are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last year alone, five families buried loved ones. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=the-latest-losses>The Latest Losses</h2><p>On May 17, a woman, 55, was killed by an SUV at Washington Avenue and Fulton Street. She was crossing, and the car crushed her body. On April 8, a 101-year-old woman was struck and killed by a left-turning SUV at Montgomery Street and Brooklyn Avenue. She was crossing with the signal. The driver did not yield. The city did not protect her. The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm</strong>. In this district, they account for <strong>4 deaths and 11 serious injuries to pedestrians</strong>. Trucks and buses killed one, left another with life-altering wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds, often untraceable, have injured and maimed. Bikes, too, have left their mark, but the carnage comes on four wheels more than two. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member <strong>Crystal Hudson has backed key safety bills</strong>. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless driving and demands safer design. She joined the push to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear sightlines for people crossing. But the crisis is not over. The bills are not enough. The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-voices-of-the-street>The Voices of the Street</h2><p>A witness saw the aftermath: &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said Mugsy</a>. Another neighbor, after a deadly moped hit-and-run, said, &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said Ryan Rivera</a>.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end the reign of repeat offenders. It can act now. <strong>Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action before another name becomes a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force.
