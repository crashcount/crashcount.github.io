The Department of Transportation’s current proposal covers only the northern section, leaving out areas with poor subway access. The matter, titled 'Activists, labor push for expanded bus lane along Brooklyn’s Flatbush Avenue,' highlights slow bus speeds and chronic delays. Joseph, along with Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Crystal Hudson, supports the expansion. Labor unions TWU Local 100 and 1199 SEIU also back the effort. Mayor Eric Adams has not met the bus lane targets set by the 2019 Streets Master Plan.

Law aims to curb reckless riding.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0874-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on May 16, 2024. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing a pilot abatement program for unsafe operators of pedal-assist bicycles,' orders the Department of Transportation to launch a three-year pilot. Riders with three or more moving violations must complete a DOT-run safety course. Fail, and their pedal-assist bike can be seized until proof of course completion. The bill requires DOT to report on course completions, impounds, and program effectiveness. Council Member Joann Ariola leads as primary sponsor, joined by Crystal Hudson, Farah N. Louis, Darlene Mealy, Chris Banks, and Kamillah Hanks. The measure seeks to hold repeat offenders accountable and reduce harm to pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the operation of a motor vehicle with fraudulent or expired license plates.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Feliz, Salamanca, Powers, Restler, Won, Brewer, Schulman, Ung, Marte, Hudson, Avilés, De La Rosa, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill makes it unlawful to drive with fake or expired plates, including temporary ones. Civil penalties apply, but drivers with expired plates get a 10-day window to fix the issue. The bill aims to close loopholes that let reckless drivers evade detection and accountability. It awaits further action in committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
