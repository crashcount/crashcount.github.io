According to the police report, 'One driver asleep. His head struck. He lay unconscious. The bicycle lay broken in the gutter.' The report lists 'Fell Asleep' as the contributing factor, indicating the SUV driver lost control due to fatigue. The crash involved two SUVs, with the Honda SUV moving straight ahead when it struck the cyclist. The police report details the cyclist was ejected and suffered crush injuries. No evidence in the report points to any cyclist error; the only cited cause is the driver’s failure to remain alert. The narrative underscores the systemic danger posed by inattentive or impaired drivers behind the wheel of large vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
