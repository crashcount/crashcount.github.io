In the last twelve months, four people were killed and nine suffered serious injuries in crashes. Nearly 700 were hurt. The dead include a 101-year-old woman crossing with the light, a 55-year-old man mowed down at midnight, and a woman struck after stepping out of a taxi. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p>On April 8, Taibel Brod tried to cross Brooklyn Avenue with the walk signal. An unlicensed driver turned left and hit her. She died in the hospital. Her son <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>recalled</a>, &ldquo;She walked every morning from Crown Heights to Brookdale Hospital. She used to feed patients there for many years.&rdquo;</p><p>A week later, a man tried to cross Washington Avenue at Fulton. A Ford Explorer slammed into him and kept going. He died before sunrise. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>called it the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn in a week</a>.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-unkept-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Unkept Promises</h2><p>SUVs and cars did most of the killing. In three years, they caused more than three-quarters of pedestrian deaths and serious injuries here. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are wide. The signals are short. The danger is constant.</p><h2 id=the-response-what-crystal-hudson-has-doneand-not-done>The Response: What Crystal Hudson Has Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has backed bills to build protected bike lanes, daylight intersections, and legalize crossing mid-block. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to end jaywalking tickets</a> and co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act. She called for more crossing guards and curb extensions after a child was killed by a city tow truck. But when it came to Atlantic Avenue—the deadliest stretch—she stopped short of demanding a full redesign. The city <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>says to wait two more years for real change</a>. The bodies keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk. Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a full redesign of Atlantic Avenue, daylighting at every corner, and protected lanes where people walk and ride. Do not wait for another name to join the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council aims to clear paths for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0080-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after its introduction on February 8, 2024. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations," creates a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 2,640 feet of a school. The penalty is $175 per violation. The Department of Transportation must launch a civilian reporting program. If DOT prosecutes a case using civilian evidence, the complainant gets 25% of the proceeds.

The Department of Transportation briefly removed a car-free Open Street in Fort Greene, a move traced to City Hall. Councilmember Crystal Hudson, representing District 35, criticized the administration for failing to fill 483 vacant crossing guard positions and for lax speeding enforcement, stating her precinct has 'a long waiting list and not enough crossing guards.' Despite Adams’ claims of 1,000 street redesigns and ongoing efforts, the administration has missed City Council-mandated goals for protected bike and bus lanes.

Eighty-eight crashes scar the street. Safety took a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On October 13, 2023, local officials and advocates criticized Mayor Adams for halting the Ashland Place redesign. The project, led by the Department of Transportation, aimed to create a protected bike lane from the Manhattan Bridge to Barclays Center. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso said, "New York City is regressing on meeting its Vision Zero goals ... and stalled street safety improvements, like those slated for Ashland Place, are a part of the reason why." State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety. City Hall deflected, blaming e-bikes for rising cyclist deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the posting of signs notifying operators of bicycles, bicycles with electric assist, and electric scooters of the prohibition against operating such devices on sidewalks, park walkways, and boardwalks, and of related fines and penalties," would require the Department of Transportation and the Department of Parks and Recreation to post signs warning riders of these restrictions and the consequences.

The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No direct safety analysis was provided.

The city moved on.</p><p class=mb3>On October 2, 2023, the closure of the South Portland Avenue open street in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, was reported. The NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) ended contractor support in spring 2023, citing a shift of resources to higher-need areas and the street's ineligibility for the Public Space Equity Program. The matter summary states, 'A block-long "open street"...ended in spring 2023 after the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) reassigned its contractor elsewhere.' Council Member Crystal Hudson did not comment on the closure. Volunteers, including Phillip Kellogg, Brian Blessinger, and Mike Lydon, voiced frustration and burnout, highlighting the failure of relying on unpaid labor for public safety. No significant local opposition existed. The loss underscores the need for permanent city-backed programs to protect vulnerable road users and maintain safe, car-free spaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed for over ten years, aims to transform Atlantic Avenue from a car-dominated corridor into a safer, mixed-use area. The report, described as 'exhaustive' by Council Member Crystal Hudson, highlights community demands for deeply affordable housing, safer streets, and better infrastructure. Hudson stated, 'the community surrounding Atlantic Avenue has called for a new vision for this dangerous corridor.' The plan identifies needs like bike boulevards, raised crosswalks, and wider sidewalks. However, the Department of Transportation raised concerns about protected bike lanes due to truck traffic. The rezoning process is set to begin, but major safety changes remain years away. Vulnerable road users must wait as the city delays real action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, planned for over a year, aimed to add two-way protected bike lanes and convert some blocks to one-way for cars. According to Streetsblog, 'Officials from the Adams administration have held up part of yet another long-planned street redesign at the behest of a major local business opposed to part of the plan.' Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a top aide to Mayor Adams, reportedly ordered DOT to halt work after Two Trees Management, a powerful real estate company, lobbied against changes near its parking garage. Council member Crystal Hudson did not comment. DOT staff expressed frustration, saying such interference blocks progress for pedestrians and cyclists. The block near Two Trees remains without new markings, while other blocks move ahead.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
