The SUV did not stop in time.

In the last twelve months, District 35 saw <strong>4 deaths and 676 injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>Children, elders, and working people</strong>—no one is spared. SUVs and cars do most of the killing. In three years, <strong>17 people have died</strong> on these streets. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h3><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and legalize crossing mid-block. She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and pushed for curb extensions, daylighting, and better lighting. But on Atlantic Avenue, where four died and 473 were hurt in three years, the city delays real redesign. Hudson called for safety but stopped short of demanding a road diet. &ldquo;Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/29/bp-reynoso-dot-must-open-its-street-safety-toolkit-on-atlantic-ave>said Borough President Reynoso</a>.</p><p>On Empire Boulevard, Hudson’s office called a protected bike lane &ldquo;a necessary step to protect cyclists and pedestrians&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/26/community-board-calls-for-protected-bike-lane-on-empire-boulevard>after the community board demanded it</a>.

Call the Mayor. Tell them to finish the job: redesign deadly streets, lower speed limits, and protect every crossing. <strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the 24-year-old motorcyclist, who wore a helmet, was thrown from his bike and crushed under the SUV’s front, suffering injuries to his entire body. The Ford carried seven occupants, including five children and two adults, none of whom were reported injured. The police report lists no specific driver errors or contributing factors for either vehicle. The motorcyclist’s helmet is noted in the data, but the impact proved fatal.

The report calls to 'ensure safe, clean, well-maintained sidewalks with well-lit intersections,' and to 'provide training to MTA bus drivers on working with older riders and riders with disabilities.' Hudson stated, 'We have to do all we can to ensure that our communities are responsive to the needs of our aging population.'
