The state attorney general later released the footage. “Video shows cop speeding in NYPD van,” the report said. His sister asked for the officers’ firing and prosecution. The NYPD offered no answers. Smith is still dead. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/12/19/video-shows-cop-speeding-in-nypd-van-and-suggests-he-was-watching-a-soccer-game-before-fatal-crash>Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>In April 2022, the officer was put on modified duty. City hall stayed quiet. Another family learned how accountability moves here. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/04/15/nypd-driver-who-killed-man-on-eastern-parkway-is-placed-on-modified-duty>Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>Smith’s family sued a year later. Their lawyer called the city’s process “rigorous and unnecessarily brutal.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/07/10/family-of-man-killed-by-recklessly-driving-cop-sues-city>Streetsblog</a>.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-cuts-deepest>Where the street cuts deepest</h3><p>The worst harm clusters on a few corridors. <strong>Eastern Parkway</strong> leads with three deaths and 216 injuries since 2022. <strong>Atlantic Avenue</strong> follows with two deaths and 118 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 101‑year‑old woman, crossing with the signal at Montgomery and Brooklyn, was killed by a left‑turning SUV. The driver was unlicensed. The police coded “Failure to Yield” and “Driver Inattention.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>At Eastern Parkway and Albany, an 8‑year‑old boy was struck by a Honda SUV in the intersection. He died. The record notes “View Obstructed/Limited.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-clocks-cruel-pattern>The clock’s cruel pattern</h3><p>The injuries don’t wait for the night. They spike with the rush. The hours from 4 p.m. through 9 p.m. carry the heaviest toll, with deaths logged at 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 p.m. Hundreds are hurt in those windows. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Across this council district since 2022: pedestrians, six dead and 562 hurt; cyclists, one dead and 487 hurt; motorcyclists and moped riders, one dead and 162 hurt. Car and SUV occupants account for ten dead and 1,879 injured. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>SUVs keep coming up in the bodies. They killed four pedestrians in the current roll‑up of district injuries; sedans injured the most. Heavy trucks and buses add their own dead and wounded. <a href=#>District stats</a> (see cited roll‑up under NYC Open Data).</p><h3 id=why-people-are-hit-here>Why people are hit here</h3><p>What the city logs tells a plain story. “Failure to Yield.” “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” “View Obstructed/Limited.” These codes sit on death files. They match what we see on the ground: big vehicles turning across people, blind corners stuffed with parked metal, long, fast approaches. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Fulton at Washington, a Pennsylvania‑plated SUV going straight killed a 55‑year‑old woman at 12:21 a.m. The report lists “Crush Injuries.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Utica at St. Johns, a motorcyclist hit the back of a parked refrigerated van and died. The rider was noted “Unlicensed.” The bike was demolished. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-city-moved-on-small-things-the-big-fixes-wait>The city moved on small things. The big fixes wait.</h3><p>City Hall passed a decal law to warn riders about dooring. It took effect this summer. It may help, a little. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council record</a>.</p><p>The Council also ordered derelict cars off the curb within 72 hours. Fewer hulks means fewer blocked lines of sight. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council record</a>.</p><p>Two bills that would clear corners and force curb extensions sit or crawl: a ban on parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and a mandate for curb extensions at the worst intersections. Local members signed on. The daylighting bill was laid over in April. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council record</a>.</p><h3 id=what-must-be-built-into-the-street>What must be built into the street</h3><p>Daylight every corner on Eastern Parkway, Atlantic, Fulton, Bedford, Nostrand. Hard posts, not paint. Curb extensions at the worst hit zones. Leading pedestrian intervals at the left‑turn crashes. These are standard tools. The sponsors put them on paper. The city has to put them in concrete. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council record</a>.</p><p>Target the evening peaks. Protect the crossings where the bodies pile up. Enforce yielding at lefts. Tow the cars that hide people at the crosswalks. The law to clear junkers is now on the books. Use it. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council record</a>.</p><h3 id=citywide-levers-that-save-lives>Citywide levers that save lives</h3><p>Speed is the killer in slow motion. Albany already gave the city the power to lower limits. The path is set out by advocates: a <strong>citywide 20 mph default</strong>, and <strong>intelligent speed assistance for repeat offenders</strong>. The case is made here: <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</p><p>One and a half percent of drivers are tied to more than a fifth of pedestrian deaths, and the worst repeat camera offenders are many times more likely to kill. The device would hold them to the limit. The numbers and names are in the record. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</p><h3 id=a-last-word-from-the-record>A last word from the record</h3><p>“No criminality is suspected,” police said after two people were killed by trains one hour apart. Another day. Another body on the tracks. Another file. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>Ronald Smith’s sister spoke once and didn’t flinch: “They dragged my brother.” The video shows the rest. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/12/19/video-shows-cop-speeding-in-nypd-van-and-suggests-he-was-watching-a-soccer-game-before-fatal-crash>Streetsblog</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Surveillance and body camera footage, released by Attorney General Letitia James on December 19, 2022, shows the van speeding, running a red light, and striking Ronald Smith, a pedestrian. The van dragged Smith 35-40 feet. The matter summary states: 'Video shows cop speeding in NYPD van—and may have been watching a soccer game before fatal crash.' Smith’s sister, Julie Floyd, and Justice Committee director Yul-san Liem condemned the officers’ actions and inaction. Floyd called for their firing and prosecution, saying, 'These officers drove an NYPD van so fast and recklessly... they dragged my brother... and had no regard for my brother’s life.' The NYPD declined to comment or disclose the officers’ status.
