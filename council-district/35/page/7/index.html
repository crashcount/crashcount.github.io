The street swallowed him whole.</p><p>A woman, 55, was crushed by an SUV at Washington Avenue and Fulton Street in May. She was crossing, not at an intersection. The driver kept going straight.

She voted yes to end jaywalking enforcement, a law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals</a>. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, curb extension bills, and measures for more protected bike lanes. But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not enough.

This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Hudson. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings and daylight at every intersection. Do not wait for another child to die. The time for half-measures is over. The dead cannot speak.
