In the last twelve months, four people were killed and nine suffered serious injuries in crashes. Nearly 700 were hurt. The dead include a 101-year-old woman crossing with the light, a 55-year-old man mowed down at midnight, and a woman struck after stepping out of a taxi. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p>On April 8, Taibel Brod tried to cross Brooklyn Avenue with the walk signal. An unlicensed driver turned left and hit her. She died in the hospital. Her son <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>recalled</a>, &ldquo;She walked every morning from Crown Heights to Brookdale Hospital. She used to feed patients there for many years.&rdquo;</p><p>A week later, a man tried to cross Washington Avenue at Fulton. A Ford Explorer slammed into him and kept going. He died before sunrise. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>called it the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn in a week</a>.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-unkept-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Unkept Promises</h2><p>SUVs and cars did most of the killing. In three years, they caused more than three-quarters of pedestrian deaths and serious injuries here. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are wide. The signals are short. The danger is constant.</p><h2 id=the-response-what-crystal-hudson-has-doneand-not-done>The Response: What Crystal Hudson Has Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has backed bills to build protected bike lanes, daylight intersections, and legalize crossing mid-block. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to end jaywalking tickets</a> and co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act. She called for more crossing guards and curb extensions after a child was killed by a city tow truck. But when it came to Atlantic Avenue—the deadliest stretch—she stopped short of demanding a full redesign. The city <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>says to wait two more years for real change</a>. The bodies keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk. Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a full redesign of Atlantic Avenue, daylighting at every corner, and protected lanes where people walk and ride. Do not wait for another name to join the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill targets tourist and luxury flights, sparing only essential services. Noise, pollution, and safety risks drive the move. The city’s airspace faces a reckoning.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2022, Council Member Lincoln Restler and colleagues introduced a bill to ban all non-essential helicopter flights from the Wall Street and East 34th Street city-owned helipads. The legislation, discussed in the City Council, exempts NYPD, news, and hospital helicopters. The bill’s matter title: 'Stop the Chop.' Council Members Amanda Farias, Gale Brewer, Shahana Hanif, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Christopher Marte, and Carlina Rivera joined as sponsors. Hanif stated, 'Our airspace is not for sale to the highest bidder and should only be available to essential needs of our city.' The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution. The proposal aims to cut thousands of flights, reduce greenhouse gases, and restore peace to city parks and neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Crystal Hudson, whose districts border or include the park, call for a new policy to allow e-assist bikes. The article states, 'This policy is discriminatory and ableist, and harmful to climate goals.' Hanif notes e-bikes enabled her to ride after hip surgery. The ban forces riders onto dangerous streets, blocks access for families and people with limited mobility, and invites selective NYPD enforcement. The council members urge Mayor Adams to lift the ban, arguing it closes the park to those who need safe, accessible routes most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

Council Member Lynn C. Schulman sponsored the bill, joined by Kagan, Hudson, Hanif, Abreu, Restler, Riley, and Sanchez.
