The report states the collision occurred when the sedan’s left front quarter panel hit the cyclist, resulting in a severe arm injury described as an amputation. The cyclist was ejected from his bike but remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' and 'Passing Too Closely' as contributing factors, both attributed to the sedan driver’s actions. The bike itself was left undamaged. No contributing factors were attributed to the cyclist. The crash underscores the persistent danger posed by vehicles reentering traffic without regard for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'One driver asleep. His head struck. He lay unconscious. The bicycle lay broken in the gutter.' The report lists 'Fell Asleep' as the contributing factor, indicating the SUV driver lost control due to fatigue. The crash involved two SUVs, with the Honda SUV moving straight ahead when it struck the cyclist. The police report details the cyclist was ejected and suffered crush injuries. No evidence in the report points to any cyclist error; the only cited cause is the driver’s failure to remain alert. The narrative underscores the systemic danger posed by inattentive or impaired drivers behind the wheel of large vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
