Nine seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, District 35 has seen 1,271 crashes. Children, elders, and working people—no one is spared. An eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway with his sister. The driver stayed. The boy did not. “Yeah, this street is dangerous,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said a neighbor</a>.</p><p>A 101-year-old woman died in a crosswalk on Montgomery Street.

They are lives cut short, families broken, shoes left behind on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed five people and injured over 400 more on foot or bike. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll. The violence is relentless. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has backed bills to daylight crosswalks, build protected bike lanes, and legalize crossing mid-block. She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. Hudson called for a full redesign of Atlantic Avenue, one of Brooklyn’s deadliest roads, but the city stalled. “Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/29/bp-reynoso-dot-must-open-its-street-safety-toolkit-on-atlantic-ave>said Borough President Reynoso</a>. Hudson’s record shows support for safer streets, but the pace is slow. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted corners on every block. Demand action before another child’s name is written in chalk. The dead cannot call.

The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.' Council Member Sandy Nurse’s district saw mandates shaped by community board amendments, not her advocacy. Dan Garodnick, Department of City Planning chair, said, 'parking and housing are no longer coming into conflict in the parts of New York City that are well-served by transit.' The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others.

He calls for a road diet, better bike and pedestrian infrastructure, and metered parking. DOT offers piecemeal fixes, but no bold redesign. Advocates want more.</p><p class=mb3>On January 29, 2025, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso pressed the Department of Transportation to overhaul a six-lane stretch of Atlantic Avenue as part of a rezoning plan. Reynoso’s recommendations—outlined in his official statement—include a road diet, pedestrian and cyclist upgrades, and paid parking. He criticized DOT’s lack of detail, saying, 'Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum.' The Atlantic Avenue Mixed Use Plan, now heading to a Department of City Planning hearing, would rezone 13 blocks and remove parking minimums for new housing. Council Member Crystal Hudson acknowledged the community’s demand for safety but stopped short of backing a road diet. DOT has promised some safety tweaks—painted neckdowns, daylighting, planters, a new bike lane—but not a full redesign. Advocates and Transportation Alternatives call for protected bike lanes and pedestrian plazas. Reynoso’s push highlights the gap between incremental fixes and the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
