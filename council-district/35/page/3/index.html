The report states, 'The box truck hit him first. The SUV followed. Head shattered. Bones crushed. He died there, beneath the streetlights, far from the crosswalk, alone on the asphalt.'

The pedestrian was crossing the street at a location not marked by a signal or crosswalk, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the lethal impact of large vehicles moving unchecked through city streets, leaving a man dead and unanswered questions in their wake.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
