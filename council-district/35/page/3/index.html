Forty-three have been seriously hurt.</strong> The dead include a 101-year-old woman crossing with the light, a 39-year-old man crushed on Atlantic Avenue, and a 55-year-old woman struck on Washington Avenue. These are not numbers. They are lives ended and families broken.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the killing.</strong> SUVs alone took three lives and left hundreds injured. Trucks, vans, and buses added more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, left bodies in their wake. Bikes hurt, but they did not kill.</p><h2 id=the-latest-blood-on-the-asphalt>The Latest Blood on the Asphalt</h2><p>The carnage does not slow. In May, a 55-year-old woman was killed by an SUV on Washington Avenue. She was not at an intersection. She did not stand a chance. In April, a 101-year-old woman died crossing with the signal at Brooklyn Avenue. The driver was unlicensed. The car was an SUV. The law did not save her. The street did not save her. No one did. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h2><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has taken some steps. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require curb extensions</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>. She backed the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act</a>, which targets reckless driving and demands safer design.</p><p>But the city moves slow. Atlantic Avenue remains a death trap. Hudson has called for change, but the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>Department of Transportation delays</a>. &ldquo;Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum,&rdquo; said Borough President Reynoso, as Hudson <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/29/bp-reynoso-dot-must-open-its-street-safety-toolkit-on-atlantic-ave>acknowledged the need for safety</a> but stopped short of demanding a full redesign.</p><h2 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h2><p><strong>Every delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Hudson.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) would not commit to a 'road diet' or redesign for the deadly 13-block Brooklyn stretch, pending a traffic study that could take two years and requires Council funding. Council Members Crystal Hudson and Chi Ossé, along with Borough President Antonio Reynoso, demanded a fully funded redesign, calling Atlantic Avenue 'one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough.' Residents testified about fear and danger from speeding cars and blind turns. From 2021 to 2024, four people died and 473 were injured in 831 crashes. Advocates and lawmakers condemned DOT's reluctance, calling it emblematic of citywide failures.

The matter summary states the plan 'aims to bring nearly 4,600 new apartments, safeguard manufacturing space, and enhance pedestrian safety and infrastructure.' Hudson praised Borough President Reynoso’s recommendations, emphasizing 'strong manufacturing requirements, affordable housing, tenant protections, street safety, and workforce opportunities.' She called for a 'robust redesign of Atlantic Avenue that incorporates street safety improvements.' The plan includes a 'road diet' to reduce lanes, more metered parking, and safety upgrades at dangerous intersections. Residents and advocates raised concerns about displacement, legal protections, and infrastructure strain.

Reynoso’s recommendations—outlined in his official statement—include a road diet, pedestrian and cyclist upgrades, and paid parking. He criticized DOT’s lack of detail, saying, 'Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum.' The Atlantic Avenue Mixed Use Plan, now heading to a Department of City Planning hearing, would rezone 13 blocks and remove parking minimums for new housing. Council Member Crystal Hudson acknowledged the community’s demand for safety but stopped short of backing a road diet. DOT has promised some safety tweaks—painted neckdowns, daylighting, planters, a new bike lane—but not a full redesign. Advocates and Transportation Alternatives call for protected bike lanes and pedestrian plazas. Reynoso’s push highlights the gap between incremental fixes and the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike. The bill has not yet received a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
