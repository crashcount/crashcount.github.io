In the last twelve months, four people were killed and nine suffered serious injuries in crashes. Nearly 700 were hurt. The dead include a 101-year-old woman crossing with the light, a 55-year-old man mowed down at midnight, and a woman struck after stepping out of a taxi. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p>On April 8, Taibel Brod tried to cross Brooklyn Avenue with the walk signal. An unlicensed driver turned left and hit her. She died in the hospital. Her son <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>recalled</a>, &ldquo;She walked every morning from Crown Heights to Brookdale Hospital. She used to feed patients there for many years.&rdquo;</p><p>A week later, a man tried to cross Washington Avenue at Fulton. A Ford Explorer slammed into him and kept going. He died before sunrise. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>called it the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn in a week</a>.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-unkept-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Unkept Promises</h2><p>SUVs and cars did most of the killing. In three years, they caused more than three-quarters of pedestrian deaths and serious injuries here. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are wide. The signals are short. The danger is constant.</p><h2 id=the-response-what-crystal-hudson-has-doneand-not-done>The Response: What Crystal Hudson Has Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has backed bills to build protected bike lanes, daylight intersections, and legalize crossing mid-block. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to end jaywalking tickets</a> and co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act. She called for more crossing guards and curb extensions after a child was killed by a city tow truck. But when it came to Atlantic Avenue—the deadliest stretch—she stopped short of demanding a full redesign. The city <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>says to wait two more years for real change</a>. The bodies keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk. Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a full redesign of Atlantic Avenue, daylighting at every corner, and protected lanes where people walk and ride. Do not wait for another name to join the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Hanif (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, and Julie Menin, the bill demands the city identify intersections with the most pedestrian crashes. The official summary states: “Curb extensions prohibit parking near crosswalks at an intersection, increasing pedestrian visibility.” The law would force curb extensions—no parking within 15 feet of crosswalks—at a minimum of five dangerous intersections per borough, every year. Hanif, Hudson, and Menin push for concrete change. The bill’s language is blunt: visibility saves lives. City agencies must oversee and evaluate. The measure aims to cut the carnage where it hits hardest—at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
