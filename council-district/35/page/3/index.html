An SUV struck him as he crossed. The record shows only the facts: head injury, death at the scene. No mention of a toy, no last words. Just a number—another child lost in Crown Heights. In the past year, five people have died on District 35 streets. Four were pedestrians. One was a child.</p><p>A 55-year-old woman was crushed by an SUV at Washington Avenue and Fulton Street. She was not at an intersection. She died there. The data is cold, but the loss is not. In the same year, 682 people were injured in crashes here. Nine suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-relentless-pattern>The Relentless Pattern</h3><p>The numbers do not lie. SUVs and cars are the main killers—five deaths, 426 injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, injured 28. Motorcycles and mopeds left no one dead, 23 injured. Bikes injured 29, but killed no one. The streets are not safe for the old or the young. The record is clear.</p><p>A witness saw a man struck by a moped. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>the witness said</a>. The rider wore a mask and fled. The old man was left behind.</p><p>A son watched his father die in the street. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. The driver fled. The family waited for a miracle that never came.</p><h3 id=council-member-hudson-action-and-gaps>Council Member Hudson: Action and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills</a> to daylight intersections, expand protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking—measures that shift blame away from victims and demand safer design. Hudson voted yes on the law that ended jaywalking tickets, making it clear: streets belong to people, not just cars. She backed the SAFE Streets Act and curb extensions to protect those on foot. But the carnage continues. No law has yet stopped the killing.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The disaster is slow, but it is not fate. Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers, not crackdowns on cyclists and pedestrians. Join with others. Refuse to let another child, another parent, become a number.</p><p>Act now. The blood on the street is not yet dry.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The vehicle left the roadway and struck a 58-year-old man who was 'not in roadway,' standing off the road. The pedestrian was also left with crush injuries to his entire body. The police narrative describes the car as demolished, its shell silent under the streetlight.

The cyclist was ejected from his bike but remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' and 'Passing Too Closely' as contributing factors, both attributed to the sedan driver’s actions. The bike itself was left undamaged. No contributing factors were attributed to the cyclist.

According to the police report, 'One driver asleep. His head struck. He lay unconscious. The bicycle lay broken in the gutter.' The report lists 'Fell Asleep' as the contributing factor, indicating the SUV driver lost control due to fatigue. The crash involved two SUVs, with the Honda SUV moving straight ahead when it struck the cyclist. The police report details the cyclist was ejected and suffered crush injuries. No evidence in the report points to any cyclist error; the only cited cause is the driver’s failure to remain alert. The narrative underscores the systemic danger posed by inattentive or impaired drivers behind the wheel of large vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
