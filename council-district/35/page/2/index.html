In the last twelve months, four people were killed and nine suffered serious injuries in crashes. Nearly 700 were hurt. The dead include a 101-year-old woman crossing with the light, a 55-year-old man mowed down at midnight, and a woman struck after stepping out of a taxi. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p>On April 8, Taibel Brod tried to cross Brooklyn Avenue with the walk signal. An unlicensed driver turned left and hit her. She died in the hospital. Her son <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>recalled</a>, &ldquo;She walked every morning from Crown Heights to Brookdale Hospital. She used to feed patients there for many years.&rdquo;</p><p>A week later, a man tried to cross Washington Avenue at Fulton. A Ford Explorer slammed into him and kept going. He died before sunrise. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>called it the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn in a week</a>.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-unkept-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Unkept Promises</h2><p>SUVs and cars did most of the killing. In three years, they caused more than three-quarters of pedestrian deaths and serious injuries here. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are wide. The signals are short. The danger is constant.</p><h2 id=the-response-what-crystal-hudson-has-doneand-not-done>The Response: What Crystal Hudson Has Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson has backed bills to build protected bike lanes, daylight intersections, and legalize crossing mid-block. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to end jaywalking tickets</a> and co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act. She called for more crossing guards and curb extensions after a child was killed by a city tow truck. But when it came to Atlantic Avenue—the deadliest stretch—she stopped short of demanding a full redesign. The city <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>says to wait two more years for real change</a>. The bodies keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk. Call Council Member Hudson. Demand a full redesign of Atlantic Avenue, daylighting at every corner, and protected lanes where people walk and ride. Do not wait for another name to join the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers. Streets belong to people again.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now Local Law 98 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 26, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident occurred at 13:14. The report describes the rider as 'incoherent,' with 'severe bleeding' and no helmet. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor.

Jolyse Race of Riders Alliance stressed the economic justice at stake, noting bus riders earn half as much as car owners. Mayor Eric Adams has withheld support, citing community engagement and raising concerns about gentrification. The Department of Transportation's plans have stalled under his administration.

The report states the driver was unlicensed and failed to yield the right-of-way. The impact broke the woman’s hip and caused severe lacerations, leaving her conscious but immobilized on the pavement. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. The collision occurred when the sedan’s right front bumper hit the pedestrian, who was in the crosswalk. No evidence in the report suggests any pedestrian error contributed to the crash. The focus remains on the unlicensed driver’s actions and the systemic danger posed by drivers who disregard basic traffic laws.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Council Member Hudson stays neutral, watching safety.</p><p class=mb3>On April 11, 2024, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a policy change reducing Willoughby Avenue Open Street hours from 24/7 to 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. The DOT claims, 'the revised hours will provide older New Yorkers and people with disabilities better street access while preserving the Open Street during its peak hours.' Council Member Crystal Hudson, a known supporter of livable streets, has not taken a clear stance but is monitoring the situation for safety. The Fort Greene Open Streets Coalition opposes the change, stating, 'Opening the street to vehicles during prime early morning hours and throughout the late evenings as the days grow longer will be an unfortunate mistake, and increases the potential for conflict with street safety impacts.' The coalition also disputes the DOT’s financial rationale, arguing the change will increase city costs due to extra staffing for barricades. The move reflects a broader city trend of reduced support for open streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the driver struck the SUV 'face-first,' suffering severe facial bleeding. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The unlicensed status of the driver is explicitly noted. The SUV was slowing or stopping when it was hit, and the impact was to the center back end of the SUV. No passengers were involved. The narrative describes 'blood trailing down his chin,' underscoring the violence of the collision. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the unlicensed driver’s unsafe speed and inattention.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the sole contributing factor. The vehicle, registered in North Carolina, was traveling east and struck the pedestrian outside a crosswalk. The police report makes no mention of pedestrian error as a contributing factor, focusing entirely on the driver’s distraction. The incident underscores the ongoing threat posed by inattentive drivers on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
