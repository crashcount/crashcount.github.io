The state attorney general later released the footage. “Video shows cop speeding in NYPD van,” the report said. His sister asked for the officers’ firing and prosecution. The NYPD offered no answers. Smith is still dead. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/12/19/video-shows-cop-speeding-in-nypd-van-and-suggests-he-was-watching-a-soccer-game-before-fatal-crash>Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>In April 2022, the officer was put on modified duty. City hall stayed quiet. Another family learned how accountability moves here. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/04/15/nypd-driver-who-killed-man-on-eastern-parkway-is-placed-on-modified-duty>Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>Smith’s family sued a year later. Their lawyer called the city’s process “rigorous and unnecessarily brutal.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/07/10/family-of-man-killed-by-recklessly-driving-cop-sues-city>Streetsblog</a>.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-cuts-deepest>Where the street cuts deepest</h3><p>The worst harm clusters on a few corridors. <strong>Eastern Parkway</strong> leads with three deaths and 216 injuries since 2022. <strong>Atlantic Avenue</strong> follows with two deaths and 118 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 101‑year‑old woman, crossing with the signal at Montgomery and Brooklyn, was killed by a left‑turning SUV. The driver was unlicensed. The police coded “Failure to Yield” and “Driver Inattention.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>At Eastern Parkway and Albany, an 8‑year‑old boy was struck by a Honda SUV in the intersection. He died. The record notes “View Obstructed/Limited.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-clocks-cruel-pattern>The clock’s cruel pattern</h3><p>The injuries don’t wait for the night. They spike with the rush. The hours from 4 p.m. through 9 p.m. carry the heaviest toll, with deaths logged at 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 p.m. Hundreds are hurt in those windows. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Across this council district since 2022: pedestrians, six dead and 562 hurt; cyclists, one dead and 487 hurt; motorcyclists and moped riders, one dead and 162 hurt. Car and SUV occupants account for ten dead and 1,879 injured. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>SUVs keep coming up in the bodies. They killed four pedestrians in the current roll‑up of district injuries; sedans injured the most. Heavy trucks and buses add their own dead and wounded. <a href=#>District stats</a> (see cited roll‑up under NYC Open Data).</p><h3 id=why-people-are-hit-here>Why people are hit here</h3><p>What the city logs tells a plain story. “Failure to Yield.” “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” “View Obstructed/Limited.” These codes sit on death files. They match what we see on the ground: big vehicles turning across people, blind corners stuffed with parked metal, long, fast approaches. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Fulton at Washington, a Pennsylvania‑plated SUV going straight killed a 55‑year‑old woman at 12:21 a.m. The report lists “Crush Injuries.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Utica at St. Johns, a motorcyclist hit the back of a parked refrigerated van and died. The rider was noted “Unlicensed.” The bike was demolished. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-city-moved-on-small-things-the-big-fixes-wait>The city moved on small things. The big fixes wait.</h3><p>City Hall passed a decal law to warn riders about dooring. It took effect this summer. It may help, a little. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council record</a>.</p><p>The Council also ordered derelict cars off the curb within 72 hours. Fewer hulks means fewer blocked lines of sight. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council record</a>.</p><p>Two bills that would clear corners and force curb extensions sit or crawl: a ban on parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and a mandate for curb extensions at the worst intersections. Local members signed on. The daylighting bill was laid over in April. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council record</a>.</p><h3 id=what-must-be-built-into-the-street>What must be built into the street</h3><p>Daylight every corner on Eastern Parkway, Atlantic, Fulton, Bedford, Nostrand. Hard posts, not paint. Curb extensions at the worst hit zones. Leading pedestrian intervals at the left‑turn crashes. These are standard tools. The sponsors put them on paper. The city has to put them in concrete. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council record</a>.</p><p>Target the evening peaks. Protect the crossings where the bodies pile up. Enforce yielding at lefts. Tow the cars that hide people at the crosswalks. The law to clear junkers is now on the books. Use it. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council record</a>.</p><h3 id=citywide-levers-that-save-lives>Citywide levers that save lives</h3><p>Speed is the killer in slow motion. Albany already gave the city the power to lower limits. The path is set out by advocates: a <strong>citywide 20 mph default</strong>, and <strong>intelligent speed assistance for repeat offenders</strong>. The case is made here: <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</p><p>One and a half percent of drivers are tied to more than a fifth of pedestrian deaths, and the worst repeat camera offenders are many times more likely to kill. The device would hold them to the limit. The numbers and names are in the record. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</p><h3 id=a-last-word-from-the-record>A last word from the record</h3><p>“No criminality is suspected,” police said after two people were killed by trains one hour apart. Another day. Another body on the tracks. Another file. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>Ronald Smith’s sister spoke once and didn’t flinch: “They dragged my brother.” The video shows the rest. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/12/19/video-shows-cop-speeding-in-nypd-van-and-suggests-he-was-watching-a-soccer-game-before-fatal-crash>Streetsblog</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The move follows complaints from local residents, especially after a viral video showed a child running into the lane from a double-parked car and colliding with an e-bike. Adams stated, 'we listened to community concerns and decided to adjust the current design to better reflect community feedback.' The Department of Transportation will revert the protected lane to its previous unprotected state between Willoughby and Flushing avenues. The article highlights ongoing political battles over street design and notes that double-parking and chaotic traffic remain unaddressed. Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro cited 'lack of action' on e-bike safety as a barrier to safer infrastructure. The decision removes a key safety measure for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop vehicles from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections. The new design will first appear at high-crash sites in Brooklyn, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue and several others.

The lawsuit says tying DOT money to immigration crackdowns endangers safety. Projects stall. Streets grow riskier. Immigrants fear reporting crimes. The federal move puts lives on the line.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, New York Attorney General Letitia James led a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration’s move to tie U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) funding to state cooperation with immigration enforcement. The suit, joined by other state attorneys general, challenges an April 24 announcement by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that would cut off funding to states refusing to enforce federal immigration law or maintain diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The matter summary states, 'DOT’s blatant overreach threatens to divert critical resources away from public safety and undermine projects that keep our communities connected and safe.' James and her colleagues argue this policy forces states to choose between billions in infrastructure funds and supporting immigrant communities. They warn that withholding funds will halt vital safety projects, making streets and transit more dangerous. The attorneys general also note that immigrants may avoid reporting crimes if they fear deportation, further undermining public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
