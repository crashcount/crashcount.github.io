Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In just over three years, District 21 has seen 4,314 crashes. The wounded fill hospital beds. The dead leave empty chairs. Children, cyclists, workers—no one is spared. In the last year alone, two people died and six suffered life-changing wounds. The youngest lost was eight, crossing with the light, crushed by a turning truck. The oldest was 43, killed in a parked SUV. The violence is slow, steady, and everywhere.</p><h2 id=one-night-one-family-shattered>One Night, One Family Shattered</h2><p>On February 26, 2025, a man ran a red light on Northern Boulevard. He was drunk, high, and driving more than three times the speed limit. He hit Justin Diaz, 23, on his way to work. Justin died at the scene. His brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/justin-diaz-queens-bmw-driver-michael-pena-drunk-speeding-mercedes-fdny-firefighter-crash/>said, &ldquo;Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail&mldr; Justin will never walk the streets again&rdquo;</a>. The driver had 25 school zone speeding tickets. Still, he drove. Still, he killed. Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>called it out plain: &ldquo;Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-roadblocks>Leadership: Progress and Roadblocks</h2><p>Council Member Francisco Moya has voted for some safety bills—greenways, greener medians, step street lighting. He backed a bill to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). But Moya has also slowed progress. He led efforts to delay street redesigns, requiring more notice before removing parking or car lanes. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/15/city-makes-jamaica-busways-permanent-but-with-shorter-hours-begins-northern-blvd-bus-lanes>lobbied against bus and bike lanes</a> on Northern Boulevard and 111th Street. The city’s own data shows open streets like Paseo Park cut injuries by half, but Moya <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/10/25/number-crunch-paseo-park-is-already-a-success-story-defying-screaming-foes>blocked its expansion into his district</a>.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Moya. Demand he support protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and a 20 mph speed limit. Demand he stop blocking proven safety projects. Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. The dead cannot call. The living must.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The goal is simple: safer steps.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0875-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced May 16, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to install pedestrian lighting on at least 25 step streets each year. The bill’s matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends. The measure targets a clear hazard: darkness on city stairs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Francisco Moya attended the unveiling, praising Mets owner Steve Cohen for the new bike share stations. Yet, Moya has a record of opposing local bike and bus lanes, including efforts to block a bike lane on 111th Street and a bus lane on Northern Boulevard. Advocates and community members, including Jim Burke, welcomed the bike share but warned that dangerous gaps persist. Cyclists must still brave hazardous crossings, especially at highway ramps without signals. With new development planned, the city faces mounting pressure to fix these deadly connections and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
