Distraction is logged often. So is failure to yield. But most deaths sit in the “other” bin, a black box with five of the ten fatalities.

On Mar 13, 2024, an 8‑year‑old boy, crossing with the signal at 31 Ave and 100 St, was killed by a left‑turning pickup; the file lists failure to yield and distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>). On Oct 10, 2023, a 16‑year‑old on a motorcycle died at Astoria Blvd and 101 St; the record cites traffic control disregarded and unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p><h3 id=northern-roosevelt-the-parkway>Northern.

These are not accidents. They are patterns.</p><p>Just outside the district line, the hit‑and‑run near JFK at 155 St and South Conduit left a 52‑year‑old man dead around 2:30 AM. “The operator of the vehicle fled the scene,” police said. No arrests (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>Daily News</a>). The lesson travels: high‑speed corridors, dark hours, a driver gone.</p><h3 id=the-year-isnt-kind>The year isn’t kind</h3><p>Year to date, crashes hold at 882, but deaths tripled from 1 to <strong>3</strong>. Injuries ticked up to <strong>555</strong>. Serious injuries rose to <strong>7</strong>. The young and the middle‑aged carry the pain: 18–24 and 35–44 each record a death this year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>period stats</a>).</p><p>Pedestrians are hit most by sedans and SUVs.

Daylight the crosswalks on Northern and Roosevelt. Harden the lefts at 31 Ave and 100 St. Give leading pedestrian intervals that hold turning drivers back. The parkway frontage needs speed control and lighting in the night hours when bodies fall. Pull trucks off local turns around schools and parks. These fixes are basic. They work where the city installs them. They are missing where people die (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Citywide, the solutions are on the table. Albany gave NYC the power to set safer speeds. A citywide residential <strong>20 MPH default</strong> is ready. It cuts deaths. The tools for camera‑caught repeat offenders are ready, too: intelligent speed assistance for the cars that won’t slow down. The worst few drivers do the most harm. Slowing every street and boxing in the super speeders will save lives.

The family mourns and demands justice.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published March 29, 2025), probationary firefighter Michael Pena was fired after he drove drunk and high, ran a red light, and crashed into Justin Diaz’s car in Queens on February 26, 2025. Surveillance footage showed Pena’s Mercedes striking Diaz’s BMW at high speed, sending it skidding down the street. Diaz, 23, died. Pena admitted at the scene, 'I hit him. I ran the red light. And I'm a firefighter.' The FDNY cited conduct rules in his dismissal. The article highlights Pena’s failure to render aid and notes his attempt to invoke his firefighter status. The case raises questions about accountability for city employees and the dangers of impaired, reckless driving on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
