His brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/justin-diaz-queens-bmw-driver-michael-pena-drunk-speeding-mercedes-fdny-firefighter-crash/>said, &ldquo;Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail&mldr; Justin will never walk the streets again&rdquo;</a>. The driver had 25 school zone speeding tickets. Still, he drove. Still, he killed. Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>called it out plain: &ldquo;Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-roadblocks>Leadership: Progress and Roadblocks</h2><p>Council Member Francisco Moya has voted for some safety bills—greenways, greener medians, step street lighting. He backed a bill to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). But Moya has also slowed progress. He led efforts to delay street redesigns, requiring more notice before removing parking or car lanes. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/15/city-makes-jamaica-busways-permanent-but-with-shorter-hours-begins-northern-blvd-bus-lanes>lobbied against bus and bike lanes</a> on Northern Boulevard and 111th Street. The city’s own data shows open streets like Paseo Park cut injuries by half, but Moya <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/10/25/number-crunch-paseo-park-is-already-a-success-story-defying-screaming-foes>blocked its expansion into his district</a>.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Moya. Demand he support protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and a 20 mph speed limit. Demand he stop blocking proven safety projects. Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. The dead cannot call.

The tanker was making a right turn while the e-bike rider, a 31-year-old man, continued straight. The police report states the truck’s right front bumper struck the e-bike, crushing the rider’s knee and foot. The report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s failure to yield. The tanker sustained no damage, while the e-bike was damaged at the center front end. The man remained conscious at the scene, suffering serious crush injuries.

The bill's title reads: "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting dynamic pricing under the city’s bike share program." Council Member Lincoln Restler is the primary sponsor, joined by Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, and Francisco P. Moya. Their action: sponsorship and referral to committee. The bill would stop the Department of Transportation from allowing dynamic pricing—defined as any fee increase based on demand—in the Citi Bike program. The goal: keep bike share affordable and predictable for all riders, especially those who rely on it most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to limiting the parking of motor vehicles by dealers.' Council Members Francisco P. Moya (primary sponsor), Sandra Ung, Lincoln Restler, and Shahana K. Hanif back the measure. It bans dealers from parking, storing, or displaying cars for sale or repair on city streets, except for emergencies. Dealers must display placards on cars awaiting repair or return. Each violation brings fines and possible impoundment. Owners get an affirmative defense if ticketed while their car is with a dealer. The bill aims to clear sidewalks and curbs, reducing hazards for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
