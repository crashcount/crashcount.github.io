Distraction is logged often. So is failure to yield. But most deaths sit in the “other” bin, a black box with five of the ten fatalities.

On Oct 10, 2023, a 16‑year‑old on a motorcycle died at Astoria Blvd and 101 St; the record cites traffic control disregarded and unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p><h3 id=northern-roosevelt-the-parkway>Northern.

These are not accidents. They are patterns.</p><p>Just outside the district line, the hit‑and‑run near JFK at 155 St and South Conduit left a 52‑year‑old man dead around 2:30 AM. “The operator of the vehicle fled the scene,” police said.

The lesson travels: high‑speed corridors, dark hours, a driver gone.</p><h3 id=the-year-isnt-kind>The year isn’t kind</h3><p>Year to date, crashes hold at 882, but deaths tripled from 1 to <strong>3</strong>. Injuries ticked up to <strong>555</strong>. Serious injuries rose to <strong>7</strong>. The young and the middle‑aged carry the pain: 18–24 and 35–44 each record a death this year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>period stats</a>).</p><p>Pedestrians are hit most by sedans and SUVs.

Daylight the crosswalks on Northern and Roosevelt. Harden the lefts at 31 Ave and 100 St. Give leading pedestrian intervals that hold turning drivers back. The parkway frontage needs speed control and lighting in the night hours when bodies fall. Pull trucks off local turns around schools and parks. These fixes are basic. They work where the city installs them. They are missing where people die (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Citywide, the solutions are on the table. Albany gave NYC the power to set safer speeds. A citywide residential <strong>20 MPH default</strong> is ready. It cuts deaths. The tools for camera‑caught repeat offenders are ready, too: intelligent speed assistance for the cars that won’t slow down. The worst few drivers do the most harm. Slowing every street and boxing in the super speeders will save lives.

According to the police report, a BMW sedan 'ran the red,' disregarding traffic control. The report lists 'Alcohol Involvement' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors. The BMW was struck head-on by a Mercedes sedan traveling straight. The 23-year-old BMW driver, unbelted and alone, was killed behind the wheel. The impact was severe enough that a parked Toyota SUV was also damaged. The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'Metal screamed. A parked Toyota caught the edge. The street fell silent.' The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the deadly consequences of driver actions—specifically, running a red light and alcohol involvement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
