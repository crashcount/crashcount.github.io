He also voted to speed removal of derelict vehicles (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857‑2024</a>).

The NYPD's Highway District Collision Investigation Squad is handling the case, and no arrests have been made.

Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me."
