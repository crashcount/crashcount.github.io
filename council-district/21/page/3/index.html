This is the cost of moving through the streets of East Elmhurst, Corona, and North Corona since 2022, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just last year, a child was crushed crossing with the light at 31st Avenue and 100th Street.

The narrative describes the impact as the truck 'veered west, struck parked cars,' and then hit the pedestrian, leaving him 'crushed but conscious.' The police report lists the driver's pre-crash action as 'Avoiding Object in Roadway,' but does not specify any contributing factors beyond 'Unspecified.'
