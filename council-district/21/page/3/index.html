His brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/justin-diaz-queens-bmw-driver-michael-pena-drunk-speeding-mercedes-fdny-firefighter-crash/>said, &ldquo;Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail&mldr; Justin will never walk the streets again&rdquo;</a>. The driver had 25 school zone speeding tickets. Still, he drove. Still, he killed. Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>called it out plain: &ldquo;Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-roadblocks>Leadership: Progress and Roadblocks</h2><p>Council Member Francisco Moya has voted for some safety bills—greenways, greener medians, step street lighting. He backed a bill to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). But Moya has also slowed progress. He led efforts to delay street redesigns, requiring more notice before removing parking or car lanes. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/15/city-makes-jamaica-busways-permanent-but-with-shorter-hours-begins-northern-blvd-bus-lanes>lobbied against bus and bike lanes</a> on Northern Boulevard and 111th Street. The city’s own data shows open streets like Paseo Park cut injuries by half, but Moya <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/10/25/number-crunch-paseo-park-is-already-a-success-story-defying-screaming-foes>blocked its expansion into his district</a>.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Moya. Demand he support protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and a 20 mph speed limit. Demand he stop blocking proven safety projects. Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. The dead cannot call.
