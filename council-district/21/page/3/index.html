He also voted to speed removal of derelict vehicles (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857‑2024</a>).

Prosecutors say Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and t-boned a BMW, killing 23-year-old Justin Diaz. The article quotes DA Melinda Katz: "An FDNY firefighter who was off duty is accused of driving under the influence, running a steady red light and slamming into a 23-year-old motorist, killing him, as he drove more than three times the posted speed limit." Pena's blood alcohol content was .156 percent, and he allegedly had drugs in his system. The BMW was sent flying into a parked car, its roof torn off. Pena faces manslaughter and related charges. The case highlights the lethal risk of extreme speeding and impaired driving on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger loses its cover.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0875-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after introduction on May 16, 2024. The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola, joined by sixteen co-sponsors, pushes for at least 25 step streets to be lit each year until all are covered. Step streets are open-air staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to strip darkness from these paths, making them safer for people on foot. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states that a 56-year-old man was standing in the roadway when the truck’s right front bumper hit him, causing severe head and crush injuries. The man remained conscious at the scene. The narrative describes the impact as the truck 'veered west, struck parked cars,' and then hit the pedestrian, leaving him 'crushed but conscious.' The police report lists the driver's pre-crash action as 'Avoiding Object in Roadway,' but does not specify any contributing factors beyond 'Unspecified.' No victim actions are cited as contributing factors.
