Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In just over three years, District 21 has seen 4,314 crashes. The wounded fill hospital beds. The dead leave empty chairs. Children, cyclists, workers—no one is spared. In the last year alone, two people died and six suffered life-changing wounds. The youngest lost was eight, crossing with the light, crushed by a turning truck. The oldest was 43, killed in a parked SUV. The violence is slow, steady, and everywhere.</p><h2 id=one-night-one-family-shattered>One Night, One Family Shattered</h2><p>On February 26, 2025, a man ran a red light on Northern Boulevard. He was drunk, high, and driving more than three times the speed limit. He hit Justin Diaz, 23, on his way to work. Justin died at the scene. His brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/justin-diaz-queens-bmw-driver-michael-pena-drunk-speeding-mercedes-fdny-firefighter-crash/>said, &ldquo;Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail&mldr; Justin will never walk the streets again&rdquo;</a>. The driver had 25 school zone speeding tickets. Still, he drove. Still, he killed. Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>called it out plain: &ldquo;Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-roadblocks>Leadership: Progress and Roadblocks</h2><p>Council Member Francisco Moya has voted for some safety bills—greenways, greener medians, step street lighting. He backed a bill to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). But Moya has also slowed progress. He led efforts to delay street redesigns, requiring more notice before removing parking or car lanes. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/15/city-makes-jamaica-busways-permanent-but-with-shorter-hours-begins-northern-blvd-bus-lanes>lobbied against bus and bike lanes</a> on Northern Boulevard and 111th Street. The city’s own data shows open streets like Paseo Park cut injuries by half, but Moya <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/10/25/number-crunch-paseo-park-is-already-a-success-story-defying-screaming-foes>blocked its expansion into his district</a>.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Moya. Demand he support protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and a 20 mph speed limit. Demand he stop blocking proven safety projects. Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. The dead cannot call. The living must.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
