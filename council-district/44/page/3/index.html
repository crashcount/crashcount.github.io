The crash left a 57-year-old female rear passenger injured with neck and crush injuries. The taxi driver was unlicensed. The police report lists 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor. These driver errors—alcohol use and operating without a license—created the conditions for harm. The woman wore a seatbelt, but the system and the drivers failed to protect her.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a 21-year-old e-bike rider, unlicensed and unhelmeted, was struck head-on by an unlicensed SUV. The rider was ejected, left unconscious, and suffered severe head bleeding. The SUV carried two occupants, both unlicensed. The report states, 'Traffic control disregarded.' This failure to obey traffic signals or signs was listed as the primary contributing factor for all involved. The e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, but this is noted only after the systemic disregard for traffic control. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers ignore basic rules and operate vehicles without licenses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams. Some penalties for repeat speeders were removed during negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
