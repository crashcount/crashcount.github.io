Police said Yarimi was driving about 50 mph in a 25 mph zone and ran a red light with a suspended license. She was charged with manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, assault, reckless driving, and other offenses. The article quotes survivor Shakhzod Ahmedova: "After the car crash, we just saw the car flipped over and two kids on the ground. We were scared."

The statement came at the funeral for Natasha Saada and her children, killed by a speeding driver on Ocean Parkway. Novakhov argued, 'six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,' and claimed, 'any driver can get much more than six.' He also denounced speed cameras, saying, 'we have too many,' and that they punish regular drivers. The bill’s matter summary centers on requiring devices for vehicles with six violations in a year. Community members and advocates at the funeral demanded stronger accountability and cited the area’s deadly history. Other local politicians, including Kalman Yeger and Simcha Felder, have also opposed speed safety measures.
