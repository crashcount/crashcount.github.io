The project, managed by Lauren Martin, adds a mid-block crossing and concrete pedestrian islands after cyclist Kala Santiago was killed by a truck at a dangerous crossing. The DOT had installed a two-way protected lane in 2021 but left a key crossing unsafe. The new fix will remove parking spots to improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT also proposed painted bike lanes in Flatbush, Midwood, and Kensington, but not protected lanes, despite high crash rates. Community Board 14 members and advocates urged quick action. Council Member Kalman Yeger opposed all bike lanes in his district, arguing for enforcement before installation. DOT plans to finish the Parkside Avenue upgrade this summer and the wider bike network by next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislation, championed by Council Member Carlina Rivera and supported by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), mandates the city to study, map, and expand greenways—'highways for cyclists and pedestrians, separated from motor vehicle traffic.' The bill focuses on low-income and underserved neighborhoods, with a final plan due by December 2024 and updates every five years. Rivera said, 'All of us are here today because we believe in a future where New Yorkers of all backgrounds... can safely access active transportation.' Brooks-Powers called it 'a real opportunity... to make a profound impact.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York praised the move, urging the city to build 'real infrastructure for cycling.'

The matter’s summary reads: 'Zeldin hits congestion toll as cash grab as he cites MTA ‘waste’.' Yeger’s action was public opposition, alongside Rep. Lee Zeldin and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, who called the plan 'a war on cars.' The toll would fund $15 billion in transit upgrades, including new subway signals and trains. Without this money, the MTA’s capital plan faces a giant hole.
