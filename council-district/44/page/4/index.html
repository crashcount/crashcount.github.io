The resolution calls for a statewide ballot. Sponsors cite risks to outer-borough communities and doubt traffic will drop. The measure is filed, not enacted. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0419-2022, filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, urges the New York State Legislature to require a statewide ballot proposal before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s congestion pricing plan—known as the Central Business District Tolling Program—can proceed. Introduced December 7, 2022, and filed at session’s end, the resolution states: “calls upon the New York State Legislature to amend state law to make implementation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s congestion pricing plan... subject to a statewide ballot proposal.” Council Member Kamillah Hanks led sponsorship, joined by Borelli, Carr, Louis, Yeger, Ariola, and Paladino. The sponsors raise concerns about pollution, health, and traffic impacts on outer-borough communities. The measure questions whether congestion pricing will cut traffic or fund transit improvements. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users is assessed. The bill remains filed, with no further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the e-bike rider was ejected and suffered fatal head injuries, dying at the scene. The report states: 'Traffic control ignored.' Both 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' are listed as contributing factors for the crash. The e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, but this is noted only after the driver errors. The sedan's right front quarter panel hit the e-bike. The crash highlights the lethal consequences when drivers disregard signals and lose focus.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
