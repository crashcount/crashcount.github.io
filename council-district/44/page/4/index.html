Children, elders, workers—none are spared. In the last year alone, <strong>eight lives ended</strong> and <strong>over 600 were hurt</strong>. The numbers are bodies. The bodies are neighbors.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a 90-year-old man was left bleeding on Avenue U.</strong> The moped rider who hit him wore a mask and fled. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. No arrest. No peace.</p><p>On Avenue I, a Smart Car driver &ldquo;plowed into&rdquo; a 70-year-old man crossing near his home. The driver stayed. Dov Broyde did not survive. No charges were filed. The city counts the dead. The street forgets nothing. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/man-70-fatally-struck-by-brooklyn-smart-car-driver/>NY Daily News</a></p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers.</strong> They caused ten deaths and over 450 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds caused no pedestrian deaths but left a trail of broken bodies. Bikes injured sixteen. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street—none are safe.</p><p>The violence is not random. It is mapped in blood. <strong>Three children died in the last year.</strong> A mother and her two daughters were killed crossing with the signal. The driver had 29 speed camera tickets. Still, he drove. Still, they died.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-absence>Leadership: Action or Absence?</h3><p>Council Member Simcha Felder has not led. There are no recent bills, no public stands, no urgent calls for safer streets. The silence is loud. The dead pile up. The city has tools—lower speed limits, more cameras, safer crossings. But in District 44, the work stalls. The council member’s record is a blank page while the obituaries grow.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-thoughts-and-prayers><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Thoughts and Prayers</strong></h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Felder. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Demand action before another family mourns at the curb.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police cite 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors in the crash, both attributed to driver actions. The narrative notes the victim was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after driver errors.

The project, managed by Lauren Martin, adds a mid-block crossing and concrete pedestrian islands after cyclist Kala Santiago was killed by a truck at a dangerous crossing. The DOT had installed a two-way protected lane in 2021 but left a key crossing unsafe. The new fix will remove parking spots to improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT also proposed painted bike lanes in Flatbush, Midwood, and Kensington, but not protected lanes, despite high crash rates. Community Board 14 members and advocates urged quick action. Council Member Kalman Yeger opposed all bike lanes in his district, arguing for enforcement before installation. DOT plans to finish the Parkside Avenue upgrade this summer and the wider bike network by next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislation, championed by Council Member Carlina Rivera and supported by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), mandates the city to study, map, and expand greenways—'highways for cyclists and pedestrians, separated from motor vehicle traffic.' The bill focuses on low-income and underserved neighborhoods, with a final plan due by December 2024 and updates every five years. Rivera said, 'All of us are here today because we believe in a future where New Yorkers of all backgrounds... can safely access active transportation.' Brooks-Powers called it 'a real opportunity... to make a profound impact.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York praised the move, urging the city to build 'real infrastructure for cycling.' The bill passed nearly unanimously, signaling strong council support for safer, more equitable streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
