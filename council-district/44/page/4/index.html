The matter summary states: 'This bill would prohibit commercial establishments from parking vehicles on city streets as part of their business.' Civil penalties ranged from $250 to $400 per day, with possible impoundment. Sponsors included Kalman Yeger (primary), Carlina Rivera, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kevin C. Riley, Marjorie Velázquez, Erik D.

The driver fled but was later found and issued multiple summonses, though not arrested. The crash site remained clogged with illegally parked cars, many marked with MTA vests and NYPD placards. These blockages forced buses to detour and left cyclists at risk. The neighborhood has no protected bike lanes. Local officials—State Sen. Simcha Felder, Assembly Member Peter Abbate, and Council Member Kalman Yeger—have opposed street safety improvements. Abbate, quoted as saying, "Bicyclists need to wear a helmet and be registered," supports more enforcement against drivers but resists bike infrastructure. He doubts DOT safety data and calls for stricter punishment for dangerous drivers, yet maintains opposition to measures that protect vulnerable road users. The MTA stated employees are not exempt from parking rules. The street remains unsafe for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
