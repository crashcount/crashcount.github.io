Prosecutors say Yarimi never braked, ran a red light, and crashed into another car before hitting the family. Saada and two daughters died; her son remains in a coma. Yarimi had a suspended license and $11,000 in unpaid violations, including 21 speed camera and five red light tickets. Brooklyn D.A. Eric Gonzalez called it 'one of the worst collisions I've ever seen on a New York City street.' Yarimi faces manslaughter and assault charges.

No students were on the bus at the time. The victims were hospitalized with serious injuries.

Novakhov argued, 'six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,' and claimed, 'any driver can get much more than six.' He also denounced speed cameras, saying, 'we have too many,' and that they punish regular drivers. The bill’s matter summary centers on requiring devices for vehicles with six violations in a year. Community members and advocates at the funeral demanded stronger accountability and cited the area’s deadly history.
