Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers. Streets belong to people again.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now Local Law 98 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 26, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced July 13, 2023, and sponsored by Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Kevin C. Riley, Kalman Yeger, Amanda Farías, and David M. Carr, the measure required DOT to install raised speed reducers within a year where feasible, then report annually on danger indicators and recommend if cameras should remain. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No raised speed reducers will be installed under this law. Vulnerable road users remain exposed at these crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
