Children, elders, workers—none are spared. In the last year alone, <strong>eight lives ended</strong> and <strong>over 600 were hurt</strong>. The numbers are bodies. The bodies are neighbors.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a 90-year-old man was left bleeding on Avenue U.</strong> The moped rider who hit him wore a mask and fled. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. No arrest. No peace.</p><p>On Avenue I, a Smart Car driver &ldquo;plowed into&rdquo; a 70-year-old man crossing near his home. The driver stayed. Dov Broyde did not survive. No charges were filed. The city counts the dead. The street forgets nothing. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/man-70-fatally-struck-by-brooklyn-smart-car-driver/>NY Daily News</a></p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers.</strong> They caused ten deaths and over 450 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds caused no pedestrian deaths but left a trail of broken bodies. Bikes injured sixteen. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street—none are safe.</p><p>The violence is not random. It is mapped in blood. <strong>Three children died in the last year.</strong> A mother and her two daughters were killed crossing with the signal. The driver had 29 speed camera tickets. Still, he drove. Still, they died.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-absence>Leadership: Action or Absence?</h3><p>Council Member Simcha Felder has not led. There are no recent bills, no public stands, no urgent calls for safer streets. The silence is loud. The dead pile up. The city has tools—lower speed limits, more cameras, safer crossings. But in District 44, the work stalls. The council member’s record is a blank page while the obituaries grow.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-thoughts-and-prayers><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Thoughts and Prayers</strong></h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Felder. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Demand action before another family mourns at the curb.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
