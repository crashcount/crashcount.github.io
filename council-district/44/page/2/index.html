On March 29, a 34‑year‑old mother and her two daughters, 8 and 5, were crossing with the signal when a northbound Audi slammed through, listed for “Traffic Control Disregarded” and “Unsafe Speed.” A taxi was turning. Three died. A 4‑year‑old boy was left unconscious. The city data logs it as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4801962</a>. No more words can fix that.</p><p>Bay Parkway at 60th Street took another life on April 6. A 61‑year‑old man in the intersection was hit by a southbound SUV going straight. He died there. The record says <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>he was crossing against the signal</a>. Only one person didn’t get to go home.</p><p>Avenue I at East 5th Street. July 7, 9:33 p.m. A 70‑year‑old pedestrian at the intersection. Police coded the driver’s cause as “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” The man died. It’s in the file as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4825939</a>.</p><p>More names and numbers fill the grid. A 42‑year‑old on a motorcycle died on Avenue P at East 2nd on June 12. The form says ejected. Dead on scene. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4820105</a>.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-cuts-deepest>Where the street cuts deepest</h3><p>The top black spots are plain. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Quentin Rd</a> shows 6 deaths and 21 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue P</a> shows 2 deaths and 58 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Ocean Parkway</a> racks up 51 injuries.</p><p>Pedestrians take the worst of it: 16 killed, 570 hurt since 2022. Bicyclists: 311 injured. This is District 44’s ledger, not a headline. SUVs and cars are the main blunt instrument, tied to most pedestrian harm in the local roll‑up. The city’s own counts say so in the small‑area analysis.</p><p>The clock tells a story too. Injury spikes start after lunch and run to evening. The 1 p.m. hour shows 8 deaths. The 2 p.m. hour shows 2 more. Crashes pile up into the commute and beyond.</p><h3 id=what-the-data-names-as-cause>What the data names as cause</h3><p>“Other” dominates the causation bucket with 29 deaths. But the patterns repeat in the files we can read: signals blown, speed too high, attention gone. One crash log notes “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” Another lists “Traffic Control Disregarded” and “Unsafe Speed.” Failure to yield sits lower on the chart here, but people on foot don’t get a second chance.</p><p>The past year crushed this district. In the first half of the year, deaths jumped from 2 to <strong>10</strong> year‑to‑date, a 400% rise. Injuries grew from 373 to 437. These are the city’s own numbers for this map.</p><h3 id=streets-to-fix-now>Streets to fix now</h3><p>Start with the killers we know:</p><ul><li>Daylight the corners on Ocean Parkway at Quentin Road. Harden the turns. Give leading walk time.</li><li>Do the same on Avenue P and Bay Parkway. Protect the crossings with concrete, not paint.</li><li>Target the repeat‑hour windows where deaths stacked up. Put eyes and speed control where the clock bleeds.</li></ul><p>These are not theories. They are standard tools for the exact failures logged here.</p><h3 id=the-policy-lever-you-can-pull-today>The policy lever you can pull today</h3><p>Citywide speed matters. District 44’s worst files list speed and signals blown. New York has the power to lower limits and to curb the worst repeat speeders. Advocates are pushing it now. Read our call and act: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>. Speed is not abstract in these records. It is a cause code and a body count.</p><h3 id=voices-from-the-record>Voices from the record</h3><p>“Criminal charges for him were still pending,” police said after one fatal Brooklyn collision in early August, as <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>Gothamist reported</a>.</p><p>“A driver struck and killed a 47‑year‑old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene,” police said of another Brooklyn death, according to the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-toll-in-one-district>The toll, in one district</h3><ul><li>Since 2022: <strong>22 deaths</strong>, 2,147 injuries in the district’s dataset. 16 pedestrians dead. 6 children under 18 dead in the period stats.</li><li>This year to date vs. last: <strong>10 deaths vs. 2</strong>. The slope is up. The names are missing.</li></ul><p>A family of three died on a green light at Ocean Parkway. The form calls it “Unsafe Speed.” The rest is a silence you can hear.</p><p>Bold steps save lives. Slower default speeds and real consequences for repeat speeders are on the table. District 44 has earned them the hard way. Do one thing now: <a href=../../take_action/>push the city to act</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop vehicles from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections. The new design will first appear at high-crash sites in Brooklyn, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue and several others. The move highlights a systemic effort to address visibility failures and reduce deadly conflicts at crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Officers first noticed the vehicle due to stolen plates and tried to pull it over on Cropsey Avenue. The driver fled, leading police to set up a blockade. As the car tried to pass, an officer fired one round, striking the driver. The wounded man crashed into a police car and was later pronounced dead at Brookdale Hospital. The passenger was unharmed and taken into custody. The incident highlights the risks of high-speed chases and roadblocks in dense urban areas, where bystanders and officers face sudden danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement came at the funeral for Natasha Saada and her children, killed by a speeding driver on Ocean Parkway. Novakhov argued, 'six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,' and claimed, 'any driver can get much more than six.' He also denounced speed cameras, saying, 'we have too many,' and that they punish regular drivers. The bill’s matter summary centers on requiring devices for vehicles with six violations in a year. Community members and advocates at the funeral demanded stronger accountability and cited the area’s deadly history. Other local politicians, including Kalman Yeger and Simcha Felder, have also opposed speed safety measures.
