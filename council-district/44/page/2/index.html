The February crash killed his passenger, Imani Vance, 26, and injured the bus driver. According to the Brooklyn DA, Epps then left the scene, calling an Uber and fleeing before being apprehended. The article quotes DA Eric Gonzalez: 'The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant's reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds.' The crash pushed the bus into a third, unoccupied vehicle. No children on the bus were harmed.

The driver had a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' according to State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The bill would require speed-limiting devices for drivers with repeated offenses, targeting those with 11 or more points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall to demand action. The article notes that auto deaths have outpaced gun deaths in New York City for two years. The bill mirrors laws for drunk driving and follows stalled efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act.
