The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reviewed it, but the bill was filed without passage at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to improving safety at pedestrian crossings in the city.' Council Members Robert F. Holden (primary sponsor), Ari Kagan, Justin L. Brannan, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Sandy Nurse, Kalman Yeger, Rita C. Joseph, and Tiffany Cabán sponsored the bill. It would have required DOT to audit the city’s deadliest intersections and consider installing leading pedestrian intervals and exclusive pedestrian phases—signals proven to protect people on foot.
