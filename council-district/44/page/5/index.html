The project, managed by Lauren Martin, adds a mid-block crossing and concrete pedestrian islands after cyclist Kala Santiago was killed by a truck at a dangerous crossing. The DOT had installed a two-way protected lane in 2021 but left a key crossing unsafe. The new fix will remove parking spots to improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT also proposed painted bike lanes in Flatbush, Midwood, and Kensington, but not protected lanes, despite high crash rates. Community Board 14 members and advocates urged quick action. Council Member Kalman Yeger opposed all bike lanes in his district, arguing for enforcement before installation. DOT plans to finish the Parkside Avenue upgrade this summer and the wider bike network by next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislation, championed by Council Member Carlina Rivera and supported by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), mandates the city to study, map, and expand greenways—'highways for cyclists and pedestrians, separated from motor vehicle traffic.' The bill focuses on low-income and underserved neighborhoods, with a final plan due by December 2024 and updates every five years. Rivera said, 'All of us are here today because we believe in a future where New Yorkers of all backgrounds... can safely access active transportation.' Brooks-Powers called it 'a real opportunity... to make a profound impact.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York praised the move, urging the city to build 'real infrastructure for cycling.' The bill passed nearly unanimously, signaling strong council support for safer, more equitable streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by the New York Post, saw Yeger and others urge Governor Hochul to delay or cancel the toll. The matter’s summary reads: 'Zeldin hits congestion toll as cash grab as he cites MTA ‘waste’.' Yeger’s action was public opposition, alongside Rep. Lee Zeldin and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, who called the plan 'a war on cars.' The toll would fund $15 billion in transit upgrades, including new subway signals and trains. Without this money, the MTA’s capital plan faces a giant hole. No safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of transit investment risks more breakdowns and unsafe streets for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rally, covered by Crain's New York, featured lawmakers including Robert Holden, Kalman Yeger, Nicole Malliotakis, and Ritchie Torres. The group argued the plan would 'disproportionately harm working- and middle-class New Yorkers, increase air pollution in outer boroughs, and raise costs for businesses and consumers.' Borelli called it 'bad policy for New York City.' The event did not advance a formal bill but marked a public stand against congestion pricing.

The driver fled but was later found and issued multiple summonses, though not arrested. The crash site remained clogged with illegally parked cars, many marked with MTA vests and NYPD placards. These blockages forced buses to detour and left cyclists at risk. The neighborhood has no protected bike lanes. Local officials—State Sen. Simcha Felder, Assembly Member Peter Abbate, and Council Member Kalman Yeger—have opposed street safety improvements. Abbate, quoted as saying, "Bicyclists need to wear a helmet and be registered," supports more enforcement against drivers but resists bike infrastructure. He doubts DOT safety data and calls for stricter punishment for dangerous drivers, yet maintains opposition to measures that protect vulnerable road users. The MTA stated employees are not exempt from parking rules.
