Streets choke with blocked bike lanes and chaos. Manual enforcement fails. DOT backs automation. Some lawmakers resist, call for cops. Vulnerable road users left dodging danger as debate drags.</p><p class=mb3>On March 3, 2025, a legislative proposal surfaced to deploy automated parking enforcement cameras across New York City. Assemblymember Steven Raga leads the push for a $35 million pilot, aiming to install 150 cameras targeting double parking and illegal stops. The bill, not yet assigned a committee or number, seeks to automate enforcement where manual efforts fall short. Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead. The Department of Transportation supports the expansion, stating, 'Automated enforcement has proven to change driver behavior and make our streets safer for everyone.' The debate centers on whether automation or police presence best protects pedestrians and cyclists from blocked lanes and traffic hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The front end of the vehicle was crushed in the collision. A 27-year-old woman, riding as an unbelted front passenger, suffered head and crush injuries but remained conscious.

The data points to driver error involving alcohol, a systemic danger that endangers all occupants. The victim’s lack of safety equipment is noted in the report, but only after the primary role of alcohol use by the driver. The crash underscores the ongoing threat posed by impaired driving on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, "A van veered, struck a station wagon. The SUV’s driver, 54, died belted in place. The airbag burst. His body broke inside." The driver of the SUV was killed, suffering injuries to his entire body despite the deployment of the airbag and use of a lap belt. Two others were in the van. The police report explicitly cites "Unsafe Lane Changing" as the contributing factor. The van’s pre-crash action is listed as "Changing Lanes," and the point of impact was the center front end. No victim behavior is listed as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the van driver’s unsafe maneuver, which led directly to the fatal outcome.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
