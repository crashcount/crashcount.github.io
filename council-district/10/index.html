But they do not lie. <strong>Ten people killed. Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In three years, 3,688 crashes tore through these streets. <strong>One cyclist dead on West 181st, struck by a truck while riding at night. A 15-year-old thrown from a moped on Saint Nicholas Avenue, never to come home.</strong></p><p>The wounds are not just numbers. A mother waits for a son who will never walk through the door. A cyclist’s helmet lies cracked on the curb. <strong>SUVs and cars led the body count, with two pedestrian deaths and over a hundred serious injuries.</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has backed some measures that matter. She co-sponsored the push for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Sammy’s Law</a>, giving the city power to lower speed limits. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She fought for <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/washington-bridge-between-manhattan-and-bronx-gets-bus-and-protected-bike-lanes>protected bike lanes on the Washington Bridge</a>, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been so afraid to walk a bridge on foot&mldr; it was an accident waiting to happen.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/washington-bridge-between-manhattan-and-bronx-gets-bus-and-protected-bike-lanes>Washington Bridge upgrades</a></p><p>But not every move protects the vulnerable.

As nurse and crash survivor Lauren Pine <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/12/opinion-weakening-injury-insurance-coverage-for-cabbies-will-harm-victims-of-road-violence>warned</a>, &ldquo;The minimum $50,000 no fault insurance was exhausted within the first week or so of my hospitalization.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Speed and inattention still kill.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to redesign streets and keep cars away from crosswalks. But every delay means another family shattered. <strong>Contact Council Member De La Rosa. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand full insurance for victims. Demand streets where children can cross without fear.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Safety lost.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2025, Council Member Carmen De La Rosa and advocates rallied for Intro 1133 and Intro 1135, bills to expand minimum wage protections to all delivery workers, including those for Instacart. The rally, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw few delivery workers attend. The matter summary reads: 'Advocates for delivery workers rallied on May Day in support of two pro-delivery worker bills, but many workers stayed home due to fears of deportation.' De La Rosa called for closing the Instacart loophole and ending discrimination. The chilling effect of immigration enforcement left the most at-risk workers absent. Safety analysts warn: when vulnerable workers avoid advocacy, their ability to demand safer streets and fair conditions shrinks. Systemic risks and inequities for pedestrians and cyclists persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight for fair pay continues.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2025, the City Council, led by Council Member Carmen De La Rosa, rallied for two bills: Intro 1133 and Intro 1135. Both aim to expand minimum wage protections to all delivery workers, including those for third-party grocery services like Instacart. The rally, held on May Day, highlighted the vulnerability of immigrant delivery workers, many of whom stayed home due to heightened deportation fears. De La Rosa declared, 'These workers are already being discriminated against and marginalized in our city. Let’s not make their lives harder by allowing a loophole in the law to take money out of their pockets.' The bills seek to close the 'Instacart loophole' and ensure equity for all delivery workers. The Council also passed a bill raising the cap on fees delivery apps can charge restaurants, which will result in Relay workers receiving the $21.44 minimum wage. The current law’s confusion and gaps leave many workers unprotected and at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law requires the Department of Transportation to consult with the Fire Department before approving open street applications, bicycle lane projects, or major transportation projects. The official matter title states the law amends the city code to require DOT to consult with FDNY and notify affected firehouses before moving forward. Primary sponsor Kalman Yeger, with co-sponsors including Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, Lynn Schulman, and others, pushed the bill through. The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes. No safety analyst assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users. The law’s effect: more agencies weigh in, but the process for safer streets grows longer and more complex.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
