In the last twelve months alone, 486 neighbors were hurt in 945 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last summer, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st Street. A truck, parked and unmoving, became the last thing he saw. The record shows: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> was the cause. The helmet did not save him. The street did not forgive him.

A 21-year-old woman burned to death as a passenger on 10th Avenue. The list goes on. Each crash a wound that never heals.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against the softest bodies.</p><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>). But for the families who lost someone, the numbers are cold comfort.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let NYC set its own speed limits and give crash victims a bill of rights. She backed a ban on parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines for walkers. She voted yes on warning decals in taxis to protect cyclists from getting doored (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act and other legislation</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets that put people before steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list.

Mayor Eric Adams said, "there’s going to be a whole rule making process to make sure that we comply and follow the laws." Critics argue the plan singles out e-bikes while ignoring faster, heavier vehicles. Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences." Janet Schroeder of the E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the rule will matter without real enforcement. The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor violations, raising questions about fair and effective policy.

The judge's order 'bars the DOT from engaging in any retaliatory measures' and prevents cancellation of the toll, which charges drivers $9 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. Federal officials had threatened to withhold funds for road and street safety projects if the city continued the program. The order lasts until June 9, keeping the toll in place and leaving critical infrastructure funding uncertain. The article highlights the standoff between federal authorities and city leaders, with safety and mobility projects at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA and state officials dismissed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s threats to withdraw funding as a 'sham,' arguing that the dispute is already in court. Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.'

The article quotes Transportation Alternatives: “That 5-7 second head start can mean the difference between being hit by a turning car and being seen by a turning car.” Esparza says officers ignore the rule, issuing criminal summonses instead of traffic tickets.

The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support.

The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
