The driver struck a 29-year-old woman on her bike, then ran. The officers checked her, then left. The car sat empty. The street stayed the same. Neighbors watched. One said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 10 saw <strong>1,204 crashes</strong>. <strong>Sixteen people were seriously hurt</strong>. <strong>665 were injured</strong>. No one died this year—luck, not policy. Last year, two people died. The year before, more. The numbers do not rest.</p><h3 id=the-toll-on-the-vulnerable>The Toll on the Vulnerable</h3><p>The wounded are young and old. Forty children under 18 were hurt this year. Cyclists and walkers take the worst of it. The intersection at Cabrini is a funnel for bike traffic from the bridge. It is a trap. A man named Jordan said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem.&rdquo;</a></p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. <strong>388 injuries and deaths</strong> came from cars and SUVs. <strong>22</strong> from motorcycles and mopeds. <strong>13</strong> from bikes. The street is not safe for anyone without steel around them.</p><h3 id=council-member-de-la-rosa-action-and-delay>Council Member De La Rosa: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, forcing the city to clear sightlines at 1,000 intersections a year. The <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill sits in committee</a>. The city moves slow. The cars do not. There is no record of De La Rosa leading on speed limits, protected bike lanes, or the worst repeat offenders. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another crash.</strong> Call Council Member De La Rosa. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead.</p><p><strong>The street remembers. So should we.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The program, launched in April, aimed to shift parcel transfers from trucks to cargo bikes at three Upper West Side sites. The matter summary states: 'Microhub parking zones reserved for e-commerce firms to offload parcels from trucks to cargo bikes and hand-carts routinely go unused.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez backed the plan, but only Amazon and Net-Zero Logistics used their hubs. UPS trucks kept blocking streets. DOT threatens to revoke unused permits. The safety impact is negative: unused microhubs mean trucks still crowd curbs, missing a chance to protect pedestrians and cyclists from large vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Manhattan Community Board 5 called this move not a "real solution" to safety, urging a return to the 2021 plan with protected bike lanes and faster bus service. "We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue," said CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia. The board warns that without bike lanes, cyclists will ride sidewalks, risking conflict. The plan, shaped with business interests, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and delays safer changes until at least 2028.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
