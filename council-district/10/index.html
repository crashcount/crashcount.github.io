The plan, now open for public comment, would require companies to register with DOT, assign unique ID cards to workers, and provide mandatory safety training and gear. Adams said, 'Our administration is committed to creating safer, more sustainable streets for everyone.' The rules demand reflective vests and reporting of vehicle types. Critics warn of risks to undocumented workers. A safety analyst notes: while training and gear may help individuals, the policy fails to address systemic traffic dangers and shifts responsibility onto vulnerable workers instead of drivers or city infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez backed the plan, but only Amazon and Net-Zero Logistics used their hubs. UPS trucks kept blocking streets. DOT threatens to revoke unused permits. The safety impact is negative: unused microhubs mean trucks still crowd curbs, missing a chance to protect pedestrians and cyclists from large vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
