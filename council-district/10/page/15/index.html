The driver struck a 29-year-old woman on her bike, then ran. The officers checked her, then left. The car sat empty. The street stayed the same. Neighbors watched. One said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 10 saw <strong>1,204 crashes</strong>. <strong>Sixteen people were seriously hurt</strong>. <strong>665 were injured</strong>. No one died this year—luck, not policy. Last year, two people died. The year before, more. The numbers do not rest.</p><h3 id=the-toll-on-the-vulnerable>The Toll on the Vulnerable</h3><p>The wounded are young and old. Forty children under 18 were hurt this year. Cyclists and walkers take the worst of it. The intersection at Cabrini is a funnel for bike traffic from the bridge. It is a trap. A man named Jordan said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem.&rdquo;</a></p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. <strong>388 injuries and deaths</strong> came from cars and SUVs. <strong>22</strong> from motorcycles and mopeds. <strong>13</strong> from bikes. The street is not safe for anyone without steel around them.</p><h3 id=council-member-de-la-rosa-action-and-delay>Council Member De La Rosa: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, forcing the city to clear sightlines at 1,000 intersections a year. The <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill sits in committee</a>. The city moves slow. The cars do not. There is no record of De La Rosa leading on speed limits, protected bike lanes, or the worst repeat offenders. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another crash.</strong> Call Council Member De La Rosa. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead.</p><p><strong>The street remembers. So should we.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

In eight months, the administration completed only 28 street redesigns near schools, out of 2,600 citywide. The Department of Transportation has 24 more projects underway. The matter summary states: 'the city's relatively minor investment in street safety upgrades will do little to mitigate the threats cars pose to children walking to and from city schools.' Council members and advocates, including Emily Stutts and Danny Harris, criticize the slow pace. Stutts says, 'It doesn’t feel like enough,' while Harris urges, 'Mayor Adams and DOT need to expand this program now to save lives.' The city expanded school-zone speed cameras to 24/7 and increased open streets for schools to 47, but this covers only a fraction of schools. Advocates demand aggressive Vision Zero action, citing rising child fatalities and persistent danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Levine wrote, 'The Hudson River Greenway is one of the most heavily used bike paths in the country... congestion has worsened significantly.' He sent his letter to state DOT Commissioner Therese Dominguez and city DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Local elected officials and Community Board 1, which voted 41-3 in May 2020 to support the change, also back the plan. State senators, assembly members, and council members signed a letter urging the same. Levine and supporters argue the new lane would ease crowding and give e-bike delivery workers—many of them immigrants—a safe, legal route. The state DOT has resisted, citing car congestion. Advocates say more space for cyclists is overdue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement reads: 'Closing any portion of Fordham Road to vehicular traffic will result in many negative consequences... creating endless gridlock and danger for pedestrians.' DOT proposals include full or partial busways, but local surveys show 86% of visitors already arrive by walking, bus, or train.
