On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe. On June 1, 2024, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on W 181st Street. These are not scenes. They are names we do not print.</p><p>The toll we carry</p><p>Since 2022, District 10 has <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>logged</a> 4,108 crashes, 2,143 injuries, 45 serious injuries, and 10 deaths. SUVs and sedans led the harm to people on foot; trucks and buses were a smaller share. The count does not slow.</p><p>City says it can act. It must act uptown.</p><p>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery, the city <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>moved</a> fast. “As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The warning was blunt: “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Ben Furnas. The Heights and Inwood have dangerous blocks too.</p><p>What your council member has done</p><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>, a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up daylighting barriers at intersections. That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In eight months, the administration completed only 28 street redesigns near schools, out of 2,600 citywide. The Department of Transportation has 24 more projects underway. The matter summary states: 'the city's relatively minor investment in street safety upgrades will do little to mitigate the threats cars pose to children walking to and from city schools.' Council members and advocates, including Emily Stutts and Danny Harris, criticize the slow pace. Stutts says, 'It doesn’t feel like enough,' while Harris urges, 'Mayor Adams and DOT need to expand this program now to save lives.' The city expanded school-zone speed cameras to 24/7 and increased open streets for schools to 47, but this covers only a fraction of schools.

According to Streetsblog NYC, there have been 36 reported crashes near this intersection since 2019, injuring three pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Fifty percent of those who are dying in intersections are seniors.' Irma Rosenblatt of Families for Safe Streets called for urgent action from Mayor Adams, DOT, and local officials: 'We need action today... How many more seniors have to die?' The Bronx faces a surge in road deaths. Vulnerable road users, especially seniors, remain exposed to unchecked traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Kagan said, 'It was one of the most dangerous intersections in Coney Island, not just for pedestrians but for drivers as well.' The crossing serves the Scheuer House senior facility. Community Board 13 and local groups demanded action. Brooks-Powers praised the advocacy: 'Now, your residents will be able to cross the street safely!'

The matter, described as an 'existential threat' by Bronx business leaders, questions the impact of restricting car traffic on the busy corridor. Feliz, in a letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, acknowledged slow bus speeds but echoed concerns about diverted traffic and business access. The statement reads: 'Closing any portion of Fordham Road to vehicular traffic will result in many negative consequences... creating endless gridlock and danger for pedestrians.' DOT proposals include full or partial busways, but local surveys show 86% of visitors already arrive by walking, bus, or train. Feliz called for a balanced plan, reflecting ongoing tension between business interests and safer, faster transit for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The shared path, only 11 feet wide, is far below DOT’s own safety standards. Injuries have increased as usage soars—nine cyclists hurt in three years, up from three. Julie Won said, "People walking or biking on the shared path are paying with bloody pavement and broken bones, all so the DOT can promote car travel for the few." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the project is a priority, but the city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed. Nine lanes for cars, half a lane each for people.
