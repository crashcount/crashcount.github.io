Sixteen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Not one death this year—yet. But these numbers are not mercy. They are luck, and luck runs out.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit her, then ran. Neighbors watched. One said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> Another pleaded, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</a> The intersection is a wound that never heals.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> SUVs and cars do most of the damage. In three years, they killed two, left 15 with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Motorcycles and mopeds have left their mark, too. Bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction of the carnage from larger vehicles.</p><p>The young are not spared. Forty-one children were hurt in the past year. The old are broken, too—twenty injured, one seriously, among those over 75. The numbers do not lie. They only count.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to a bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, a move to clear sightlines and protect those on foot. It is a start, not a finish. The bill sits in committee. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the asphalt.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>Call De La Rosa. Call the Council. Demand more.</strong> Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand that every child, every elder, every cyclist, every walker gets home alive. The city will not save you unless you force its hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2022, Mayor Eric Adams announced a $904 million budget proposal for street redesign and safety improvements in New York City. The plan, tied to the 2019 'streets master plan' law, aims to add 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of bus lanes by 2026. The proposal, described as a 'historic investment,' must be negotiated with the City Council by June. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams is involved in ongoing talks. The mayor’s plan is less ambitious than the Council’s $3.1 billion proposal, which would add 500 miles of bike lanes and more pedestrian plazas. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez admitted delays in upgrading bike lane barriers. The announcement comes as fatal crashes surge—traffic deaths rose 44% in early 2022. Mayor Adams called for action against dangerous drivers, underscoring the urgent need for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, led by Councilwoman Sandy Nurse of District 37, restores alternate side parking and funds year-round cleaning of protected bike lanes. The official summary states: 'City allocates $11 million to make streets cleaner and improve mobility.' Nurse called the move 'a welcome relief to communities that have faced an unprecedented increase in litter during the pandemic.' The investment covers new equipment and staff, including a pilot fleet of 10 Micromobility Operations Machines to sweep narrow lanes. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine praised the smaller sweepers as 'a win for cyclists.' The funding appears in the Fiscal Year 2023 executive budget. The city aims to keep bike lanes clear, cut debris, and protect vulnerable road users from car intrusion.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The press conference, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted the city's lack of ambition. Rodriguez said, 'We encourage all New Yorkers to embrace the streets and imagine what could be possible if we open our streets for more than just moving personal vehicles.' Yet, no new initiatives were announced. The event's limited scope drew sharp criticism. The article compared New York's effort to the Netherlands' 1970s 'car-free Sundays,' which led to real change. Here, the city offers a press release, not protection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, children—see little relief. The cars keep coming. The danger stays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both precincts, near subway stops and with parking lots, still see officers parking on sidewalks and blocking pedestrian access. The article states: 'Many of the cars parked illegally by officers have multiple red light and speed camera violations, with the 69th Precinct having a particularly high percentage of repeat offenders.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the City Council that multiple camera violations should be rare, but precinct records show otherwise. The investigation criticizes NYPD’s disregard for pedestrian space and traffic laws, documenting officers’ contempt for street safety and the law. No council bill is attached, but the report exposes systemic danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot, announced by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, places six-bike Oonee pods at five locations across three boroughs for 29 days each, sidestepping lengthy franchise reviews. Rodriguez said, "We have found a way to make a secure parking pilot work for New York City." Bike New York's Jon Orcutt voiced frustration: "Enough with the pilots. We love Oonee, but if it doesn't scale, it doesn't matter." The DOT will collect usage data to inform future steps. Assistant Commissioner Sean Quinn noted the limited number of pods and the need for broader access. The program marks progress after years of failed attempts, but advocates demand a permanent, citywide network to truly protect cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hudson, joined by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez, faced vocal opponents worried about lost parking and emergency access. Hudson said, 'This is about more than just open streets, this is about safe streets.' DOT surveys showed 88 percent support for permanent safety changes. Mayor Eric Adams ordered the street restored after learning Hudson opposed its closure. Rodríguez highlighted a spike in traffic deaths, noting, 'We have a responsibility to think about, first of all, protecting our senior citizens.' According to NYC Crash Mapper, 72 people—mostly cyclists and motorists—were injured on this stretch in the past decade, but no deaths.
