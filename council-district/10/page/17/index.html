On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe.

The warning was blunt: “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Ben Furnas.

That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report urges full-time operation, noting cameras cut speeding by 72 percent where installed. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls passage 'very important.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Governor Hochul support local control. Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives says, 'We need Albany to allow New York City to operate speed safety cameras 24/7 so every neighborhood is protected from speeding drivers every hour of the day, every day of the week.' Despite strong public support, the legislature has not acted.

The funding will upgrade weakly protected bike lanes and step up enforcement against reckless drivers.

The press conference, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted the city's lack of ambition. Rodriguez said, 'We encourage all New Yorkers to embrace the streets and imagine what could be possible if we open our streets for more than just moving personal vehicles.' Yet, no new initiatives were announced. The event's limited scope drew sharp criticism. The article compared New York's effort to the Netherlands' 1970s 'car-free Sundays,' which led to real change. Here, the city offers a press release, not protection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, children—see little relief. The cars keep coming.

Both precincts, near subway stops and with parking lots, still see officers parking on sidewalks and blocking pedestrian access. The article states: 'Many of the cars parked illegally by officers have multiple red light and speed camera violations, with the 69th Precinct having a particularly high percentage of repeat offenders.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the City Council that multiple camera violations should be rare, but precinct records show otherwise. The investigation criticizes NYPD’s disregard for pedestrian space and traffic laws, documenting officers’ contempt for street safety and the law. No council bill is attached, but the report exposes systemic danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

We love Oonee, but if it doesn't scale, it doesn't matter." The DOT will collect usage data to inform future steps.

The meeting followed the abrupt, unannounced removal of barriers from the eight-block stretch, which sparked swift backlash. Hudson, joined by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez, faced vocal opponents worried about lost parking and emergency access. Hudson said, 'This is about more than just open streets, this is about safe streets.' DOT surveys showed 88 percent support for permanent safety changes. Mayor Eric Adams ordered the street restored after learning Hudson opposed its closure. Rodríguez highlighted a spike in traffic deaths, noting, 'We have a responsibility to think about, first of all, protecting our senior citizens.' According to NYC Crash Mapper, 72 people—mostly cyclists and motorists—were injured on this stretch in the past decade, but no deaths.
