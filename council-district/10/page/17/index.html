Ten people have died on these streets since 2022. Forty-three more suffered serious injuries. In the last year alone, 660 neighbors were hurt in 1,196 crashes. No one is spared—children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians. The violence is relentless.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was killed on West 181st Street, his chest crushed, his life ended by a truck <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to city data</a>. Last fall, a 15-year-old on a moped died at St. Nicholas Avenue, thrown from his seat, crushed by an SUV. The street does not forgive. The numbers keep climbing.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>Each crash leaves a scar—a mother, a son, a friend. The pain is not abstract. It is a name, a body, a family left behind. &ldquo;Kirk was taken from me just as we were starting our new life together. He was the love of my life,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/27/us-news/drunk-teen-jimmy-connors-killed-groom-to-be-kirk-walker-in-wrong-way-crash-after-night-out-at-nyc-club-new-suit-alleges/>said Shauntea Weaver</a> after a wrong-way crash killed her fiancé the day before their wedding.</p><p>The violence is not fate. It is the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who design and police these streets.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has taken steps. She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines and protect those on foot and bike <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>according to council records</a>. But the bill sits in committee, waiting. The city moves slow.

But cameras alone are not enough. The dead cannot wait for another study, another delay.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The crisis is not over. The next victim is already walking. Call Council Member De La Rosa. Demand action. Demand safer speeds, daylighted intersections, and streets built for people, not cars.

Both precincts, near subway stops and with parking lots, still see officers parking on sidewalks and blocking pedestrian access. The article states: 'Many of the cars parked illegally by officers have multiple red light and speed camera violations, with the 69th Precinct having a particularly high percentage of repeat offenders.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the City Council that multiple camera violations should be rare, but precinct records show otherwise. The investigation criticizes NYPD’s disregard for pedestrian space and traffic laws, documenting officers’ contempt for street safety and the law. No council bill is attached, but the report exposes systemic danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot, announced by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, places six-bike Oonee pods at five locations across three boroughs for 29 days each, sidestepping lengthy franchise reviews. Rodriguez said, "We have found a way to make a secure parking pilot work for New York City." Bike New York's Jon Orcutt voiced frustration: "Enough with the pilots. We love Oonee, but if it doesn't scale, it doesn't matter." The DOT will collect usage data to inform future steps. Assistant Commissioner Sean Quinn noted the limited number of pods and the need for broader access.

Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On March 8, 2022, Councilmember Crystal Hudson hosted a heated debate on the Willoughby Avenue open street in District 35. The meeting followed the abrupt, unannounced removal of barriers from the eight-block stretch, which sparked swift backlash. Hudson, joined by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez, faced vocal opponents worried about lost parking and emergency access. Hudson said, 'This is about more than just open streets, this is about safe streets.' DOT surveys showed 88 percent support for permanent safety changes. Mayor Eric Adams ordered the street restored after learning Hudson opposed its closure. Rodríguez highlighted a spike in traffic deaths, noting, 'We have a responsibility to think about, first of all, protecting our senior citizens.' According to NYC Crash Mapper, 72 people—mostly cyclists and motorists—were injured on this stretch in the past decade, but no deaths.

He criticizes DOT’s focus on moving cars and incremental safety fixes, calling them 'band aids.' Massengale urges Rodriguez to return to Vision Zero’s promise and adopt bold, systemic changes.

The push follows years of crashes—67 cyclist injuries and 196 total crashes since 2019—despite so-called 'protected' lanes. The matter, titled 'Activists and electeds ask DOT to add better barriers to Grand Street bike lane,' highlights how plastic bollards fail to stop drivers from blocking lanes, forcing cyclists into traffic. Restler, along with Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Julia Salazar, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, signed a letter urging Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriguez to act. The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected. Activists say, 'We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021.'

The Bus Turnaround Coalition, including Riders Alliance and TransitCenter, called for specifics on bus lane locations and stronger DOT resources. Ben Fried of TransitCenter said, 'We want to see where they are going to put the bus lanes, how they're going to provide the resources to the bus program at DOT, how they're going to keep bus lanes clear.' TransitCenter’s Tabitha Decker noted that most recommended reforms remain unimplemented. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Mayor Adams claim bold plans, but advocates see little concrete action.
