Council Member Lincoln Restler called it 'a big, big, big day for street safety.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'We will be building even more bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes as well as new plaza and other public space.' The funding will upgrade weakly protected bike lanes and step up enforcement against reckless drivers. Advocates, including Transportation Alternatives, praised the move as transformational for vulnerable road users.

The measure, led by Councilwoman Sandy Nurse of District 37, restores alternate side parking and funds year-round cleaning of protected bike lanes. The official summary states: 'City allocates $11 million to make streets cleaner and improve mobility.' Nurse called the move 'a welcome relief to communities that have faced an unprecedented increase in litter during the pandemic.' The investment covers new equipment and staff, including a pilot fleet of 10 Micromobility Operations Machines to sweep narrow lanes. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine praised the smaller sweepers as 'a win for cyclists.' The funding appears in the Fiscal Year 2023 executive budget. The city aims to keep bike lanes clear, cut debris, and protect vulnerable road users from car intrusion.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The cars always return.</p><p class=mb3>On March 31, 2022, NYC DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez announced 'Car-Free Earth Day,' a climate event closing only 3.8 miles of streets—mostly those already part of the open streets program—for a few hours on April 23. The press conference, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted the city's lack of ambition. Rodriguez said, 'We encourage all New Yorkers to embrace the streets and imagine what could be possible if we open our streets for more than just moving personal vehicles.' Yet, no new initiatives were announced. The event's limited scope drew sharp criticism. The article compared New York's effort to the Netherlands' 1970s 'car-free Sundays,' which led to real change. Here, the city offers a press release, not protection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, children—see little relief. The cars keep coming. The danger stays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both precincts, near subway stops and with parking lots, still see officers parking on sidewalks and blocking pedestrian access. The article states: 'Many of the cars parked illegally by officers have multiple red light and speed camera violations, with the 69th Precinct having a particularly high percentage of repeat offenders.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the City Council that multiple camera violations should be rare, but precinct records show otherwise. The investigation criticizes NYPD’s disregard for pedestrian space and traffic laws, documenting officers’ contempt for street safety and the law.

We love Oonee, but if it doesn't scale, it doesn't matter." The DOT will collect usage data to inform future steps. Assistant Commissioner Sean Quinn noted the limited number of pods and the need for broader access.

Hudson said, 'This is about more than just open streets, this is about safe streets.' DOT surveys showed 88 percent support for permanent safety changes. Mayor Eric Adams ordered the street restored after learning Hudson opposed its closure. Rodríguez highlighted a spike in traffic deaths, noting, 'We have a responsibility to think about, first of all, protecting our senior citizens.' According to NYC Crash Mapper, 72 people—mostly cyclists and motorists—were injured on this stretch in the past decade, but no deaths.

No more stalling.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2022, Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) joined borough presidents and advocates at Brooklyn Borough Hall to demand urgent action on New York City’s bus system. The event, titled 'Borough beeps join city transit advocates for better bus service,' spotlighted stalled promises and called for Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul to deliver. Restler and others backed the Bus Turnaround Coalition’s push for network redesigns, expanded and more frequent service, all-door boarding, and tougher enforcement in bus lanes. Comptroller Brad Lander stressed that 'expanded bus routes must also match 21st century travel patterns.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso linked better buses to less car dependence and climate action. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pledged 150 new miles of busways and lanes. The campaign aims to speed up buses, cut car dominance, and put vulnerable road users first.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency cited 'raised crosswalks, pedestrian-only signal timing, new lane markings and other lane redesigns' as part of its response. Council Member Bob Holden, speaking at the scene, pressed for longer crossing times, raised crosswalks, and enforcement against illegal parking and reckless driving. Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called the situation 'traffic violence,' demanding stronger city control over speed limits and cameras. The redesign is part of Mayor Adams's plan to fix 1,000 dangerous intersections. Residents and advocates highlighted the ongoing threat from large vehicles and a culture of reckless driving. DOT has already installed a pedestrian-only signal phase at the site.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move comes after a reckless driver killed a baby and injured her mother. Officials and neighbors pushed for this change. Cars lose space. Pedestrians gain safety.</p><p class=mb3>On February 22, 2022, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez confirmed the conversion of Gates Avenue’s stub end into 'Apolline's Garden,' a pedestrian plaza. The announcement followed a virtual Vanderbilt Avenue Block Association meeting. The plaza honors Apolline Mong-Guillemin, a 3-month-old killed by a wrong-way driver on September 11, 2021. Rodriguez stated, 'Traffic violence is a solvable crisis and I'm committed to carrying out Mayor's Adams's safety vision [by] expanding pedestrian plazas and open streets.' Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte called for unity, saying, 'There is no doubt that the creation of Apolline's Garden is the appropriate answer to honor the short life of this 3-month-old baby.' The plan aligns with the NYC 25X25 initiative to reclaim street space for pedestrians and cyclists. Community leaders and officials support the plaza as a step to prevent future tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
