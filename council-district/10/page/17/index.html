In the last twelve months alone, 486 neighbors were hurt in 945 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last summer, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st Street. A truck, parked and unmoving, became the last thing he saw. The record shows: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> was the cause. The helmet did not save him. The street did not forgive him.

Each crash a wound that never heals.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against the softest bodies.</p><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>). But for the families who lost someone, the numbers are cold comfort.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let NYC set its own speed limits and give crash victims a bill of rights. She backed a ban on parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines for walkers. She voted yes on warning decals in taxis to protect cyclists from getting doored (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act and other legislation</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets that put people before steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list.

TransitCenter’s Tabitha Decker noted that most recommended reforms remain unimplemented. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Mayor Adams claim bold plans, but advocates see little concrete action.

The matter, titled 'Could Fees for Outdoor Dining Lead to Proper Pricing of City’s Curbs?', focused on charging restaurants for curbside space. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez explained fees would depend on location and size, starting at $1,050. Council members Julie Menin and Christopher Marte raised concerns about noise, garbage, and parking loss. Livable streets groups, including Open Plans and Transportation Alternatives, supported curbside fees and called for an Office of Public Space Management. Marco Conner DiAquoi of Transportation Alternatives noted, 'Seventy-five percent of our public curb space is devoted to the movement and storage of vehicles.' The hearing showed broad support for better public space management, but the safety impact for vulnerable road users was not addressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A yellow school bus, driven by a 48-year-old man, struck and killed April Reign, a 32-year-old moped rider, near St. Marks Avenue. The driver made a sharp right turn, cut off Reign, knocked her down, and ran her over. He left the scene but later returned after a bystander intervened. No charges were filed at the time. The intersection is notorious for danger, with 487 crashes and 241 injuries reported on this stretch in 2021 alone. Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, called Brooklyn streets 'horrifically deadly for pedestrians and cyclists' and demanded immediate action. Promised safety upgrades—protected bike lanes, intersection redesigns—remain unfulfilled. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
