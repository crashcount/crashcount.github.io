In the last twelve months alone, 486 neighbors were hurt in 945 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last summer, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st Street. A truck, parked and unmoving, became the last thing he saw. The record shows: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> was the cause. The helmet did not save him. The street did not forgive him. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><p>A 15-year-old on a moped died at Saint Nicholas and 185th. A 21-year-old woman burned to death as a passenger on 10th Avenue. The list goes on. Each crash a wound that never heals.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against the softest bodies.</p><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>). But for the families who lost someone, the numbers are cold comfort.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let NYC set its own speed limits and give crash victims a bill of rights. She backed a ban on parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines for walkers. She voted yes on warning decals in taxis to protect cyclists from getting doored (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act and other legislation</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets that put people before steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list.

The city must do better.</p><p class=mb3>On January 7, 2022, Bike New York sent a letter to new DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The advocacy group declared, "The DOT bike program you inherit today is no longer a global leader or effective innovator." They criticized the agency for chasing mileage targets over safety and for letting police, film crews, and city vehicles block bike lanes. Bike New York called for physically protected lanes, more concrete, and an end to painted lanes and community board vetoes. Director Jon Orcutt said, "Bike lanes that are merely paint are obsolete and mostly useless to New Yorkers on bicycles in today’s city." DOT spokesman Seth Stein said Rodriguez agrees that a world-class protected bike lane network is key to safer streets and will consider the recommendations. The push is clear: vulnerable cyclists need real protection, not empty promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users wait.</p><p class=mb3>"Powers reiterated that he’s supported the entirety of the plan on Fifth Avenue from the beginning, and wants the Adams administration – and new DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez – to move forward with the bike lane immediately." -- Ydanis A. Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>The Fifth Avenue redesign, announced in 2020 under former Mayor de Blasio, remains stalled as of January 10, 2022. The project, once a bold car-free busway, was scaled back to a protected bike lane and minor pedestrian upgrades. No new bus lane. Community Board 5 approved the plan, but DOT has not started work. Council Member Keith Powers supports the full plan and calls for immediate action on the bike lane, urging the Adams administration and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to move forward. Local business interests, led by the Fifth Avenue Association, oppose the project, citing pandemic recovery concerns. Transportation Alternatives’ Cory Epstein says, 'Busways and bike lanes are good for the economy, good for our climate, and good for our Vision Zero goals.' Since the project’s announcement, crashes and injuries continue on the corridor. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the city delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
