The warning was blunt: “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Ben Furnas.

That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The policy, supported by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, uses federal and congestion pricing funds. The DOT aims to add 5,000 off-hour delivery sites by 2040, moving 62,000 trucks away from crowded streets. The official summary states the goal is to 'reduce peak-hour deliveries, aiming to decrease congestion and improve safety.' Rodriguez said, 'This incentive program will support local businesses and benefit all New Yorkers by reducing the number of delivery trucks on our roads during busy daytime hours.' Levine called it a move to prioritize 'safety, sustainability, and efficiency.' The plan targets small businesses, often unable to afford overnight staffing. Industry voices back the effort but worry about small business participation. Fewer trucks at rush hour means fewer deadly encounters for New York’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Now, longer cargo bikes roll legal. Four-wheelers, capped at 15 mph, can haul freight. Trucks choke streets and kill. Cargo bikes offer a safer, cleaner way. Industry pushed. DOT listened. Streets change. Pedestrians and cyclists breathe easier.</p><p class=mb3>On March 27, 2024, the NYC Department of Transportation finalized new cargo bike rules after months of industry pushback. The rules, shaped by public comment, allow pedal-assist cargo bikes up to four feet wide and 192 inches long, with four wheels, and set a 15 mph speed cap. The original proposal would have banned most existing cargo bike-trailer setups with a 120-inch limit. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez promised to get it right. Mark Chiusano, CEO of Net Zero Logistics, praised the fix: "They did a really good job of fixing the original version and made good on their word." Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi said, "We are accommodating this change in consumer culture—encouraging environmental package delivery, away from cars and trucks." Ben Morris of Coaster Cycles warned the old cap would have wiped out the market. DOT's move aims to cut truck traffic, which causes 12% of pedestrian and 30% of cyclist deaths. The new rules create a legal path for safer, greener freight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred near latitude 40.87°N, longitude 73.90°W. The report states the e-scooter operator, a 32-year-old man, suffered severe head lacerations and was found conscious at the scene. The primary contributing factor, as cited by police, was 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.' The Cadillac’s right front bumper collided with the center front end of the e-scooter. The narrative details: 'A Cadillac turned right. An e-scooter went straight. Metal met bone. A 32-year-old man hit the ground, head gashed, no helmet, blood on asphalt.' The police report notes the rider was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s failure to yield.

Twenty-nine dead last year. Highest ever. Reckless drivers surge post-pandemic. City report demands more cameras—jump from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Officials back the bill. Victims’ families demand action. Cameras cut crashes. But the most dangerous drivers remain loose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2024, the Department of Transportation released a report urging passage of a bill to expand New York City’s red-light camera program. The bill, supported by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and sponsored by State Senator Andrew Goundardes, would boost camera coverage from 150 to 1,325 intersections—about 10% of the city’s 13,700 signals. The report states: “Expanding the number of intersections with red light cameras... could substantially enhance the deterrent effect of the program and return New York City to the consistently downward trend of red light-running behavior we had seen prior to the pandemic.” Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz also supports expansion, calling for cameras at every intersection. The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains. Relatives of crash victims joined the call, demanding the city confront driver negligence and protect the community.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2024, ten New York City community boards endorsed a citywide ban on parking at intersections—a practice called daylighting. The boards urge the city to stop exempting itself from state law requiring no parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. The resolution follows fatal crashes involving children at poorly visible corners. The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data. DOT pledges to daylight 1,000 intersections yearly, but no full safety analysis exists.

The pilot, part of the 'Charge Safe Ride Safe Action Plan,' opened its first station in Cooper Square. The program, highlighted by Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33), offers 102 charging points for 100 delivery workers, many of them immigrants, at no cost.

Mayor Adams said, 'This pilot program ... will give delivery workers the ability to access safe, accessible, outdoor battery-charging that will undoubtedly save lives.'

Riders face dead batteries, empty docks, and mounting frustration. The city promised a pilot last year. Still, the streets wait. The delay leaves e-bike users stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On February 29, 2024, Council Member Erik Bottcher called out the Department of Transportation and Con Edison for failing to deliver electrified Citi Bike docks in his Manhattan district. The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives.
