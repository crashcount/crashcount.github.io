Sixteen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Not one death this year—yet. But these numbers are not mercy. They are luck, and luck runs out.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit her, then ran. Neighbors watched. One said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> Another pleaded, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</a> The intersection is a wound that never heals.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> SUVs and cars do most of the damage. In three years, they killed two, left 15 with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Motorcycles and mopeds have left their mark, too. Bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction of the carnage from larger vehicles.</p><p>The young are not spared. Forty-one children were hurt in the past year. The old are broken, too—twenty injured, one seriously, among those over 75. The numbers do not lie. They only count.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to a bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, a move to clear sightlines and protect those on foot. It is a start, not a finish. The bill sits in committee. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the asphalt.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>Call De La Rosa. Call the Council. Demand more.</strong> Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand that every child, every elder, every cyclist, every walker gets home alive. The city will not save you unless you force its hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT failed to meet 2023’s legal benchmarks: just 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes built out of 30 required, and 32 miles of protected bike lanes out of 50 mandated by 2019 law. Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives. More than half of New Yorkers remain far from protected bike lanes as daily cycling surges.

The plan required 80 miles of protected bike lanes and 50 miles of protected bus lanes in the first two years of the Adams administration. DOT delivered only 58.2 miles of bike lanes (72%) and 9.6 miles of bus lanes (19%). Only 68 of 1,000 bus stop upgrades were completed. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, "The Streets Plan is the law, and the Department of Transportation is still failing to fulfill its legal obligations." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the benchmarks "aggressive" but promised to keep trying. Mayor Adams has refused to be bound by the law’s targets. Riders Alliance demanded a real plan for bus lanes.

Brooks-Powers, who has promoted speed cameras and legislation to reward reporting hit-and-run drivers, claims her husband was responsible for the violations and that she has not used the car in over a year. Councilman Robert Holden called her a 'hypocrite,' while safe streets advocate Adam White stressed, 'Public officials and their families need to abide by speed cameras and red lights... people’s lives are at risk.'

No public design exists yet, and the Department of Transportation (DOT) has not conducted a traffic study. Community outreach is set to begin. Council Member Chris Marte (D-Chinatown) stressed, 'It’s super dangerous to cycle, to walk, and with a rapidly growing aging population, it’s always scary to see aging people walk there with cars.' Marte noted the redesign could reduce traffic confusion. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Improving safety in this area is going to be one of the top priorities.' Despite the intersection’s chaos, city data shows few recent crashes.

Restler said, 'These new mid-block crossings will create a greater sense of safety and community for Boerum Hill.' The Department of Transportation acted after Restler and others demanded change following the death of Katherine Harris, killed by a speeding driver.

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
