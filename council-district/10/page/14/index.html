On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe.

That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Officials say car-free streets mean fewer dead children.</p><p class=mb3>On October 24, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a major expansion of car-free streets for Halloween. The initiative, called 'Trick-or-Streets,' will close 100 streets—across all boroughs except Staten Island—from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. The DOT will extend hours on 40 existing open streets and keep another 60 car-free through the evening, partnering with the Street Activity Permit Office for more pedestrian zones. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'I am incredibly excited to build on the triumph of our thriving Open Streets program ... this Halloween, providing greater access to safer, shared community spaces.' Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and Council Member Shekar Krishnan backed the move, stressing the deadly risk cars pose to children. DOT data shows a 42% drop in pedestrian injury crashes on 34th Avenue since it went car-free. The city cites national spikes in child pedestrian deaths on Halloween. The message is clear: car-free streets save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, who once supported the law as a council member, now claims a protected lane would worsen traffic and turning conflicts. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Alexa Aviles criticized the decision, with Reynoso stating, 'protected bike lanes are essential,' and Aviles urging the city to 'install an alternative, fully protected bike lane where the road can accommodate one.' Advocates argue the shared lane is unsafe and often blocked by cars. The DOT’s move prioritizes vehicle flow over cyclist safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill summary reads: 'A bill that requires a multi-agency effort to create a greenway master plan for New York City unanimously passed the City Council Transportation Committee on Thursday, but there's a catch: the actual master plan won't be revealed until the end of 2024.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez supported the delay to align with a $7.25-million federal RAISE grant. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno said the funding will help 'prioritize active transportation projects that will reconnect historically disenfranchised communities.' Advocates, including Steve Vaccaro, blasted the poor state of current greenways, calling them dangerous and costly.

The bill summary states it 'would require drivers of motor vehicles to maintain a minimum distance of three feet when overtaking a bicycle.' Rodriguez sponsored the bill. Legal experts Daniel Flanzig and Steve Vaccaro criticized the lack of enforcement and the absence of a defined safe passing law, noting that most of the country already has such protections. Flanzig called the law essential to prevent tragedies like the death of Kala Santiago, who was killed by a truck driver on Parkside Avenue.

Joseph, in a joint statement with Transportation Alternatives, said, "The tragic death of yet another cyclist in our city, this time in my own neighborhood, shows how far we need to come to address traffic violence." Joseph called for urgent action to make streets safer. Parkside Avenue, not a designated truck route, has seen 161 injuries in five years, including 28 cyclists and 25 pedestrians. Advocates, including Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives, demanded the city fast-track protected bike lanes, warning, "Lives are on the line." The city has completed eight miles of protected lanes this year, with a goal of 20 by January.

Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress. Road deaths remain high, and the city lags on legal mandates for bus and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
