In the last twelve months alone, 486 neighbors were hurt in 945 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last summer, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st Street. A truck, parked and unmoving, became the last thing he saw. The record shows: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> was the cause. The helmet did not save him. The street did not forgive him. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><p>A 15-year-old on a moped died at Saint Nicholas and 185th. A 21-year-old woman burned to death as a passenger on 10th Avenue. The list goes on. Each crash a wound that never heals.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against the softest bodies.</p><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>). But for the families who lost someone, the numbers are cold comfort.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let NYC set its own speed limits and give crash victims a bill of rights. She backed a ban on parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines for walkers. She voted yes on warning decals in taxis to protect cyclists from getting doored (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act and other legislation</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets that put people before steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The blood is still fresh.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary states the law was 'an innovative way to further our goal of promoting street safety.' Powers urged the mayor and DOT to act. Despite evidence from other cities and strong support from advocates like StreetsPAC and Transportation Alternatives, City Hall cited a lack of recent deaths and continued to evaluate the program.

The measure, sponsored by then-Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez and co-sponsored by Keith Powers, empowers the city to install cameras to catch drivers who illegally pass stopped school buses. On September 7, 2022, Mayor Adams’s administration chose not to implement the program, citing ongoing evaluation and a lack of recent deaths from such incidents. Council Member Powers urged the mayor and DOT to use this tool, calling it 'an innovative way to further our goal of promoting street safety.' Activists from StreetsPAC and Transportation Alternatives criticized the delay, noting that streets near schools are especially dangerous for children, particularly in Black and brown neighborhoods. Evidence from other cities shows stop-arm cameras catch hundreds of violations quickly. The law leaves the program to mayoral discretion. City Hall supports speed cameras but has not acted on stop-arm enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pedestrians and cyclists are left out.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2022, Council Members Bob Holden and Joe Borelli publicly opposed DOT’s placement of Citi Bike docks in Queens. The dispute centers on Holden’s demand that DOT Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia be fired for using curbside parking for bike docks instead of sidewalks. Holden claims DOT ignores 'reasonable requests' and favors a 'fanatical anti-car movement.' Borelli criticizes DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for announcing a street safety redesign after a fatal crash, calling it 'shameless exploitation.' The article, titled 'Cycle of Rage: Pro-Car Council Members are the Ones Who Politicize DOT’s Work,' frames these council members as politicizing DOT’s efforts to reallocate street space from cars to bikes and pedestrians. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, which narrows the boulevard from four lanes to two, faces opposition from local elected officials, including Council Member Joe Borelli, who called it a 'recurring bad idea.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, citing Hylan's high crash rate and the epidemic of speeding, declared, 'I'm proud to announce that this safety project will move forward in the next couple of weeks.' The DOT maintains that reducing lanes and adding left-turn bays calms traffic and cuts crashes, with injury reductions seen on other city streets. Despite political pushback, the agency presses on, aiming to stem the tide of deadly crashes on Staten Island's most dangerous corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Blood stains the pavement.</p><p class=mb3>Council Members Julie Menin and Julie Won are pushing for urgent pedestrian and bike improvements on the Queensboro Bridge. The Department of Transportation (DOT) delayed the conversion of the South Outer Roadway to a full-time pedestrian path until at least the end of 2023, citing ongoing bridge repairs. The shared path, only 11 feet wide, is far below DOT’s own safety standards. Injuries have increased as usage soars—nine cyclists hurt in three years, up from three. Julie Won said, "People walking or biking on the shared path are paying with bloody pavement and broken bones, all so the DOT can promote car travel for the few." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the project is a priority, but the city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed. Nine lanes for cars, half a lane each for people. The danger is real and rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
