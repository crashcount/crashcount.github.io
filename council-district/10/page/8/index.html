On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe. On June 1, 2024, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on W 181st Street. These are not scenes. They are names we do not print.</p><p>The toll we carry</p><p>Since 2022, District 10 has <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>logged</a> 4,108 crashes, 2,143 injuries, 45 serious injuries, and 10 deaths. SUVs and sedans led the harm to people on foot; trucks and buses were a smaller share. The count does not slow.</p><p>City says it can act. It must act uptown.</p><p>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery, the city <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>moved</a> fast. “As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The warning was blunt: “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Ben Furnas. The Heights and Inwood have dangerous blocks too.</p><p>What your council member has done</p><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>, a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up daylighting barriers at intersections. That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, described as a 'massive scaleback,' drew criticism from advocates and business owners. Jackson Chabot of Open Plans said, 'It’s mind boggling that New York City is actually regressing back to more car-centered streets.' Restaurateurs like Charlotta Janssen and Robert Sanfiz warned that new seasonal rules and costly storage will force many to abandon outdoor dining. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the program 'the largest and best in America,' but critics say the city missed a chance to reclaim space from cars and support vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates call it a missed chance.</p><p class=mb3>On July 30, 2024, New York City’s outdoor dining program faced a sharp drop. Only 1,300 restaurants applied for permits, compared to 12,500 during the pandemic. The City Council and Mayor Adams changed the law, allowing roadway dining only seasonally. Eateries must set up each March and tear down by December, a heavy lift for small businesses. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, issued a 'last call' for applications. Rodriguez said, 'Outdoor dining enriches our communities, and we're excited to make it a permanent feature of New York City streets.' Yet, only 23 roadway setups are pending approval. Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans argue the city should allow year-round use, calling the decline a missed opportunity for public space and safety. The new design rules—no roofs or sides—leave some owners feeling exposed and unsafe. The city’s move shifts space back to cars, shrinking safe zones for pedestrians and diners.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life.

The RFP seeks to leverage new camera technology to address the surge in hidden plates and ensure stronger oversight. New equipment is expected by August 2025.

The bill, now under consideration, has strong support: sixteen community boards and over three dozen elected officials have signed on. The measure aims to remove parked cars from corners, a practice called 'daylighting,' to improve visibility and cut intersection crashes. Simon called it a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez has voiced concerns that daylighting could lead to faster, more dangerous turns, but advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans counter that daylighting is 'proven and widely popular.' The DOT missed a deadline for a daylighting safety study but claims it will daylight 1,000 intersections this year.

The plan, developed over two years, promised to 'remove a lane of car traffic in each direction, add protected bike lanes, and shorten pedestrian crossings.' Mayor Eric Adams ordered DOT to scale it back after opposition, leaving only partial improvements. Restler accused the mayor of ignoring traffic experts and thousands of residents. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams called the city’s response 'unacceptable' and 'irresponsible.' The Department of Transportation resumed limited work but has not finished its analysis for the southern half. Residents and advocates, including Make McGuinness Safe, cite ongoing crashes and dangerous crossings. The city’s compromise leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as the most effective safety measures remain unbuilt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by Gothamist, highlighted that 2024 is one of the deadliest years for Queens since Vision Zero began. The matter summary states, 'Five people were killed by cars over the weekend.' Paladino criticized DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and street safety advocates, calling for a 'robust, inclusive debate.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's failure to meet the 2019 NYC Streets Plan, which mandates 50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. The city has built only 72% of required bike lanes and 19% of bus lanes. Advocates point to rising deaths, especially among children, and blame delays and opposition from local officials. The debate underscores a systemic failure to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Kathy Hochul publicly supported reauthorizing New York City’s red light camera program, which is set to expire in December. The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, would renew the program for six years and expand cameras from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Hochul, at a ceremony for 'Sammy’s Law,' said, 'local governments should be making these decisions,' but did not endorse the expansion. The Adams administration and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez have pushed for more cameras. Hochul’s stance signals support for local control over traffic enforcement, but leaves the fate of a broader camera rollout uncertain.

Beaton testified, 'Half of our vehicles are stored on the street overnight.' The Adams administration aims to install up to 10,000 curbside chargers over the next decade. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized DOT for failing to meet bus and bike lane expansion mandates. Sara Lind of Open Plans countered, 'DOT and the administration are fully capable of changing the status quo and rethinking curb parking.' Advocates warned that more EV chargers could block future sidewalk, bike lane, or outdoor dining expansions.

Their letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez urges the city to connect the missing stretch between Canal Street and West 8th Street, a span where cyclists must ride in open traffic. The letter states, 'The Department of Transportation should prioritize a new bike lane at this location, which has been a long standing request of the community.' Bottcher, representing District 3, said, 'You know you're going to be in danger, because you're going to have to be riding in the same lane as speeding traffic, cars and trucks.' DOT spokesperson Nick Benson acknowledged support for the expansion but gave no timeline. The city has installed only 1.1 miles of protected bike lanes this year, far behind the 50-mile annual target in the NYC Safety Street Plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, supported by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, uses federal and congestion pricing funds. The DOT aims to add 5,000 off-hour delivery sites by 2040, moving 62,000 trucks away from crowded streets. The official summary states the goal is to 'reduce peak-hour deliveries, aiming to decrease congestion and improve safety.' Rodriguez said, 'This incentive program will support local businesses and benefit all New Yorkers by reducing the number of delivery trucks on our roads during busy daytime hours.' Levine called it a move to prioritize 'safety, sustainability, and efficiency.' The plan targets small businesses, often unable to afford overnight staffing. Industry voices back the effort but worry about small business participation. Fewer trucks at rush hour means fewer deadly encounters for New York’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
