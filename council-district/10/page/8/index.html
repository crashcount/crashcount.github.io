In the last twelve months alone, 486 neighbors were hurt in 945 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last summer, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st Street. A truck, parked and unmoving, became the last thing he saw. The record shows: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> was the cause. The helmet did not save him. The street did not forgive him. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><p>A 15-year-old on a moped died at Saint Nicholas and 185th. A 21-year-old woman burned to death as a passenger on 10th Avenue. The list goes on. Each crash a wound that never heals.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against the softest bodies.</p><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>). But for the families who lost someone, the numbers are cold comfort.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let NYC set its own speed limits and give crash victims a bill of rights. She backed a ban on parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines for walkers. She voted yes on warning decals in taxis to protect cyclists from getting doored (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act and other legislation</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets that put people before steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The blood is still fresh.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

City lags on e-bike infrastructure, but pushes forward.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2024, NYC DOT launched a public e-bike charging pilot for delivery workers. The pilot, part of the 'Charge Safe Ride Safe Action Plan,' opened its first station in Cooper Square. The program, highlighted by Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33), offers 102 charging points for 100 delivery workers, many of them immigrants, at no cost. Three companies—Swobbee, Popwheels, and Swiftmile—operate the FDNY-reviewed stations. The official summary states the pilot 'aims to improve the safety of recharging lithium-ion batteries and counter the demonization of e-bikes.' Mayor Adams said, 'This pilot program ... will give delivery workers the ability to access safe, accessible, outdoor battery-charging that will undoubtedly save lives.' The city faces delays and pushback on e-bike infrastructure, with faster progress for electric cars. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We’re going to be working to address any area where we can make an improvement.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives.

The project, led by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, was described as 'transformative' and aimed at safety for all users. The official summary states: 'The city's redesign of Third Avenue adds a wide protected bike lane and an offset bus lane over 37 blocks.' Despite these changes, advocates and local politicians criticized the plan for leaving three moving lanes and two parking lanes for cars, calling for more sidewalk space and loading zones. The redesign ends at 96th Street, where the old, car-focused layout returns. Advocates say the city must 'aim higher' to truly protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Adams pledged to clear parking near 1,000 intersections yearly to improve visibility and reduce crashes. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, told the City Council that daylighting 'must be implemented with physical infrastructure in the newly opened space to prevent vehicles from turning more quickly.' Advocacy Director Jon Orcutt of Bike New York dismissed paint-only solutions: 'If it’s just paint in 2023, forget about it.' The article documents rampant illegal parking in painted daylighting zones, often by city vehicles. Advocates argue that only physical barriers—bike racks, boulders, planters—can keep cars out and protect pedestrians. Without them, daylighting is a hollow gesture. The city’s current approach leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort, known as daylighting, aims to improve visibility and pedestrian safety. Adams said, 'Protecting New Yorkers is my most sacred responsibility as mayor.' Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers praised daylighting as 'a proven safety measure.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stressed that daylighting must include physical infrastructure to prevent reckless turns. The Department of Transportation will also add raised crosswalks, extended sidewalks, and leading pedestrian signals at 1,000 intersections next year. The city will expand speed restriction technology in its fleet and increase data transparency. Advocates and community boards have long called for these changes. With nearly 47,000 intersections citywide, the plan will take decades to reach every corner.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, called the lanes 'life-saving' and said they fill a critical gap, connecting cyclists to the Queensboro and Pulaski bridges. The project follows years of advocacy, including a 2019 push by then-Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer. Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives praised the concrete curbs and daylighting but warned that gaps remain—especially at confusing intersections and near truck routes. Shepard urged DOT to add more physical barriers and expand the network, noting, 'It’s exciting, but we still need a lot more.' The new lanes mark progress, but the area’s vulnerable road users still face danger from incomplete connections and blocked paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
