On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe.

That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Paint and ticket blitzes failed. Bus speeds barely moved. Riders remain stuck in traffic. Cars clog lanes. Promised fixes scrapped. Advocates demand real action. The city stalls. Riders suffer.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2024, MTA officials sent a scathing letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, criticizing the city’s decision to abandon plans to upgrade Fordham Road’s curbside bus lanes to offset bus lanes. The letter, signed by outgoing NYCT President Richard Davey and interim successor Demetrius Crichlow, called the city’s paint-and-enforcement approach a 'total bust.' The MTA cited new data showing bus speeds increased just 2–4 percent since October 2022—far below the 15 percent target. The matter summary reads: 'The Fordham Road project enjoys widespread support from transit advocacy groups, and Fordham Road bus riders, who have been enduring slow service for decades.' Council involvement is not specified, but the MTA’s letter and Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein both demand stronger measures. The city’s inaction leaves Bronx bus riders stranded in slow traffic, with vulnerable road users paying the price for political compromise.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restaurateurs like Charlotta Janssen and Robert Sanfiz warned that new seasonal rules and costly storage will force many to abandon outdoor dining.

Only 1,300 restaurants applied for permits, compared to 12,500 during the pandemic. The City Council and Mayor Adams changed the law, allowing roadway dining only seasonally. Eateries must set up each March and tear down by December, a heavy lift for small businesses. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, issued a 'last call' for applications. Rodriguez said, 'Outdoor dining enriches our communities, and we're excited to make it a permanent feature of New York City streets.' Yet, only 23 roadway setups are pending approval. Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans argue the city should allow year-round use, calling the decline a missed opportunity for public space and safety. The new design rules—no roofs or sides—leave some owners feeling exposed and unsafe. The city’s move shifts space back to cars, shrinking safe zones for pedestrians and diners.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push.

She sees full docks, asks if they should shrink. Experts fire back: full docks mean high use. Ridership surges. DOT stands firm. Bike-share stays. Riders keep moving.</p><p class=mb3>At a May 8, 2024, City Council oversight hearing, Council Member Althea Stevens questioned the need for a Citi Bike dock in her South Bronx district. She said, "If we're seeing that these stations aren't being used adequately ... is there another option, can we make the docks smaller?" The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, defended the current system. Bike-share experts like David Eddington countered that full docks signal popularity, not neglect. Citi Bike General Manager Patrick Knoth explained that point-in-time observations mislead, as ridership is strong and docks are planned based on trends. Citi Bike usage in Stevens's district rose 48 percent from 2022 to 2023, with most riders using reduced fares. The hearing highlighted the need for a comprehensive, accessible bike-share network, especially as e-bikes make hilly areas more reachable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move targets deadly corners where cars block sightlines. Sixteen community boards and dozens of officials back it. DOT drags its feet.

The bill, now under consideration, has strong support: sixteen community boards and over three dozen elected officials have signed on. The measure aims to remove parked cars from corners, a practice called 'daylighting,' to improve visibility and cut intersection crashes. Simon called it a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez has voiced concerns that daylighting could lead to faster, more dangerous turns, but advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans counter that daylighting is 'proven and widely popular.' The DOT missed a deadline for a daylighting safety study but claims it will daylight 1,000 intersections this year. Advocates urge the city to follow the law and protect vulnerable road users at every intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Hey, Gov. Hochul, Here’s How Congestion Pricing Would Have Remade Manhattan,' draws a sharp contrast between New York and Stockholm, where a similar policy removed 20 percent of cars and reclaimed public space for people. The piece criticizes Governor Hochul’s decision to cancel congestion pricing, arguing it denies New Yorkers the safety and freedom seen in Stockholm’s pedestrianized, business-friendly streets. The commentary features voices like Clarence Eckerson and Lars Strömgren, highlighting the benefits for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and children—who thrive when cars are fewer. The article underscores the lost opportunity for safer, calmer streets and improved transit, with no council member or bill number attached, but a clear call for systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, developed over two years, promised to 'remove a lane of car traffic in each direction, add protected bike lanes, and shorten pedestrian crossings.' Mayor Eric Adams ordered DOT to scale it back after opposition, leaving only partial improvements. Restler accused the mayor of ignoring traffic experts and thousands of residents. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams called the city’s response 'unacceptable' and 'irresponsible.' The Department of Transportation resumed limited work but has not finished its analysis for the southern half. Residents and advocates, including Make McGuinness Safe, cite ongoing crashes and dangerous crossings.

Paladino criticized DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and street safety advocates, calling for a 'robust, inclusive debate.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's failure to meet the 2019 NYC Streets Plan, which mandates 50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. The city has built only 72% of required bike lanes and 19% of bus lanes. Advocates point to rising deaths, especially among children, and blame delays and opposition from local officials.

Hochul, at a ceremony for 'Sammy’s Law,' said, 'local governments should be making these decisions,' but did not endorse the expansion. The Adams administration and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez have pushed for more cameras. Hochul’s stance signals support for local control over traffic enforcement, but leaves the fate of a broader camera rollout uncertain.
