The impact caused severe bleeding from her head, though she remained conscious at the scene. The report notes that the driver was unlicensed and fled south after the collision, leaving the vehicle undamaged. Police cite 'Driver Inexperience' as a contributing factor. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and is listed as performing 'Other Actions in Roadway,' with 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' also recorded as a contributing factor, but only after the primary driver error. The event underscores the systemic danger posed by unlicensed and inexperienced drivers operating large vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

She said, "If we're seeing that these stations aren't being used adequately ... is there another option, can we make the docks smaller?" The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, defended the current system. Bike-share experts like David Eddington countered that full docks signal popularity, not neglect. Citi Bike General Manager Patrick Knoth explained that point-in-time observations mislead, as ridership is strong and docks are planned based on trends. Citi Bike usage in Stevens's district rose 48 percent from 2022 to 2023, with most riders using reduced fares. The hearing highlighted the need for a comprehensive, accessible bike-share network, especially as e-bikes make hilly areas more reachable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now under consideration, has strong support: sixteen community boards and over three dozen elected officials have signed on. The measure aims to remove parked cars from corners, a practice called 'daylighting,' to improve visibility and cut intersection crashes. Simon called it a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez has voiced concerns that daylighting could lead to faster, more dangerous turns, but advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans counter that daylighting is 'proven and widely popular.' The DOT missed a deadline for a daylighting safety study but claims it will daylight 1,000 intersections this year. Advocates urge the city to follow the law and protect vulnerable road users at every intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Hey, Gov. Hochul, Here’s How Congestion Pricing Would Have Remade Manhattan,' draws a sharp contrast between New York and Stockholm, where a similar policy removed 20 percent of cars and reclaimed public space for people. The piece criticizes Governor Hochul’s decision to cancel congestion pricing, arguing it denies New Yorkers the safety and freedom seen in Stockholm’s pedestrianized, business-friendly streets. The commentary features voices like Clarence Eckerson and Lars Strömgren, highlighting the benefits for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and children—who thrive when cars are fewer. The article underscores the lost opportunity for safer, calmer streets and improved transit, with no council member or bill number attached, but a clear call for systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, developed over two years, promised to 'remove a lane of car traffic in each direction, add protected bike lanes, and shorten pedestrian crossings.' Mayor Eric Adams ordered DOT to scale it back after opposition, leaving only partial improvements. Restler accused the mayor of ignoring traffic experts and thousands of residents. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams called the city’s response 'unacceptable' and 'irresponsible.' The Department of Transportation resumed limited work but has not finished its analysis for the southern half. Residents and advocates, including Make McGuinness Safe, cite ongoing crashes and dangerous crossings. The city’s compromise leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as the most effective safety measures remain unbuilt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by Gothamist, highlighted that 2024 is one of the deadliest years for Queens since Vision Zero began. The matter summary states, 'Five people were killed by cars over the weekend.' Paladino criticized DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and street safety advocates, calling for a 'robust, inclusive debate.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's failure to meet the 2019 NYC Streets Plan, which mandates 50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. The city has built only 72% of required bike lanes and 19% of bus lanes. Advocates point to rising deaths, especially among children, and blame delays and opposition from local officials. The debate underscores a systemic failure to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hochul, at a ceremony for 'Sammy’s Law,' said, 'local governments should be making these decisions,' but did not endorse the expansion. The Adams administration and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez have pushed for more cameras. Hochul’s stance signals support for local control over traffic enforcement, but leaves the fate of a broader camera rollout uncertain.

The letter states, 'The Department of Transportation should prioritize a new bike lane at this location, which has been a long standing request of the community.' Bottcher, representing District 3, said, 'You know you're going to be in danger, because you're going to have to be riding in the same lane as speeding traffic, cars and trucks.'

Levine called it a move to prioritize 'safety, sustainability, and efficiency.' The plan targets small businesses, often unable to afford overnight staffing.

The original proposal would have banned most existing cargo bike-trailer setups with a 120-inch limit. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez promised to get it right. Mark Chiusano, CEO of Net Zero Logistics, praised the fix: "They did a really good job of fixing the original version and made good on their word." Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi said, "We are accommodating this change in consumer culture—encouraging environmental package delivery, away from cars and trucks." Ben Morris of Coaster Cycles warned the old cap would have wiped out the market. DOT's move aims to cut truck traffic, which causes 12% of pedestrian and 30% of cyclist deaths.

The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains.
