In the last twelve months alone, 486 neighbors were hurt in 945 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last summer, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st Street. A truck, parked and unmoving, became the last thing he saw. The record shows: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> was the cause. The helmet did not save him. The street did not forgive him. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><p>A 15-year-old on a moped died at Saint Nicholas and 185th. A 21-year-old woman burned to death as a passenger on 10th Avenue. The list goes on. Each crash a wound that never heals.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against the softest bodies.</p><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>). But for the families who lost someone, the numbers are cold comfort.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let NYC set its own speed limits and give crash victims a bill of rights. She backed a ban on parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines for walkers. She voted yes on warning decals in taxis to protect cyclists from getting doored (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act and other legislation</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets that put people before steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The blood is still fresh.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, developed over two years, promised to 'remove a lane of car traffic in each direction, add protected bike lanes, and shorten pedestrian crossings.' Mayor Eric Adams ordered DOT to scale it back after opposition, leaving only partial improvements. Restler accused the mayor of ignoring traffic experts and thousands of residents. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams called the city’s response 'unacceptable' and 'irresponsible.' The Department of Transportation resumed limited work but has not finished its analysis for the southern half. Residents and advocates, including Make McGuinness Safe, cite ongoing crashes and dangerous crossings.

Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's failure to meet the 2019 NYC Streets Plan, which mandates 50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. The city has built only 72% of required bike lanes and 19% of bus lanes. Advocates point to rising deaths, especially among children, and blame delays and opposition from local officials.

Levine called it a move to prioritize 'safety, sustainability, and efficiency.' The plan targets small businesses, often unable to afford overnight staffing.

The original proposal would have banned most existing cargo bike-trailer setups with a 120-inch limit. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez promised to get it right. Mark Chiusano, CEO of Net Zero Logistics, praised the fix: "They did a really good job of fixing the original version and made good on their word." Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi said, "We are accommodating this change in consumer culture—encouraging environmental package delivery, away from cars and trucks." Ben Morris of Coaster Cycles warned the old cap would have wiped out the market. DOT's move aims to cut truck traffic, which causes 12% of pedestrian and 30% of cyclist deaths.

The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains.

They want daylight at every intersection. They cite dead children and blind corners. City drags its feet. DOT promises 1,000 fixes a year. Boards say that’s not enough. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2024, ten New York City community boards endorsed a citywide ban on parking at intersections—a practice called daylighting. The boards urge the city to stop exempting itself from state law requiring no parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. The resolution follows fatal crashes involving children at poorly visible corners. The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data. DOT pledges to daylight 1,000 intersections yearly, but no full safety analysis exists. Boards and advocates say the city’s pace leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, presented to Manhattan Community Board 6's Transportation Committee, moves the rush-hour bus lane one lane off the curb, where NYPD and other cars often blocked buses. The bus lane will now run 24/7, not just during rush hours. DOT will widen the bike lane from six to up to ten feet in places. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the project will 'make commutes faster' and 'better protect the increasing number of cyclists,' putting 'people first on Manhattan’s avenues.'

Riders face dead batteries, empty docks, and mounting frustration. The city promised a pilot last year. Still, the streets wait. The delay leaves e-bike users stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On February 29, 2024, Council Member Erik Bottcher called out the Department of Transportation and Con Edison for failing to deliver electrified Citi Bike docks in his Manhattan district. The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT failed to meet 2023’s legal benchmarks: just 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes built out of 30 required, and 32 miles of protected bike lanes out of 50 mandated by 2019 law. Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives. More than half of New Yorkers remain far from protected bike lanes as daily cycling surges. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while officials pass the buck.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
