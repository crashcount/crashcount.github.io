The data, analyzed by Transportation Alternatives, covers 4,224 severe injuries from January 2022 to June 2023. In the second quarter of 2023 alone, 784 people—192 pedestrians and 124 cyclists among them—were seriously hurt, up from 718 the year before. The law requiring this data was sponsored by then-Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez. The report’s title calls this a 'preventable public health crisis.' Philip Miatkowski of Transportation Alternatives blames decades of policy that 'prioritize cars over people and leave behind our most vulnerable.' The data shows the Bronx had 23 percent more serious injuries per capita than the city average, Brooklyn 27 percent more, and Manhattan’s cyclist injuries were 77 percent higher per capita. The city’s DOT claims safety redesigns are underway, but the toll on vulnerable road users keeps climbing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rodriguez called bollards 'the only tool that we have in our hands' to protect pedestrians. The DOT claims its reporting obligation covers only installations by the Security Infrastructure Working Group, which has done nothing since 2020. The Council’s law did not mention this group.

Rodriguez writes, 'we proposed rules that would expand low or no-emission options for freight deliveries.' He stresses the goal: fewer trucks, safer streets, and more sustainable freight. The statement rebuts industry claims about throttle bans and powered trailer restrictions, clarifying that state law governs those issues. Rodriguez invites public feedback, promising DOT will review all comments before adopting any rule.

The plan, shaped by controversy and negotiation, keeps two lanes of car and truck traffic in both directions from the Pulaski Bridge to Calyer Street during the day, with a flex lane for parking at night. South of Calyer, the road narrows to one lane each way, with protected bike lanes, loading zones, and offset crossings. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the compromise will 'save lives and make this corridor much easier to navigate for everyone, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.' He thanked Mayor Adams, elected officials, and the community for their support. Supporters call it the biggest safety change since Robert Moses widened the road. Opponents, like Keep McGuinness Moving, say it ignores community concerns. The redesign comes after years of advocacy following multiple deaths and injuries on the corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Injuries fell at high-crash sites—45 percent on Tremont Avenue, 33 percent on Kings Highway, 16 percent on Queens Boulevard, 19 percent on Hylan Boulevard.

The plan, not tied to a council bill but a DOT initiative, expands northbound bike lanes from eight to ten feet on the upper section. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “This project will deliver much-needed safety upgrades to the Hell’s Kitchen corridor and help support more efficient transportation options.” Local advocate Christine Berthet praised the wider lanes, noting the old design could not safely carry regular bikes alongside cargo and e-bikes. The project adds pedestrian islands, dedicated left-turn lanes, and leading pedestrian intervals at key intersections. Berthet urged the city to install flex posts to keep drivers out of bike and pedestrian spaces, citing problems on nearby 11th Avenue. The changes aim to protect vulnerable road users but leave most space for cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Public hearing set for September 13.</p><p class=mb3>On August 14, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a rulemaking to permit four-wheeled, pedal-assist cargo bikes up to 48 inches wide—up from the current three wheels and 36 inches. The proposal, published in the City Record, responds to stalled state legislation and rising delivery demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'Greater use of cargo bikes will bring incredible environmental and safety benefits for New York City by reducing the number of large, high-polluting trucks on our streets.' Rodriguez added, 'Just two cargo bikes can replace one box truck, increasing safety and reducing CO2 emission by 14 tons per year.' The public comment period runs 30 days, with a hearing on September 13. The rule targets safer streets by shrinking the footprint of freight vehicles and clearing the way for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The $40 million plan, drafted in 2021 after a fatal hit-and-run, aimed to cut lanes from four to two, add protected bike lanes, and shorten crossings. Rodriguez said, "[My] personal commitment as the commissioner of DOT [is] to do the best it can to continue doing my job to improve safety on McGuinness Boulevard." Mayor Adams reversed the plan after business opposition, despite support from every other elected official. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher blamed a small group for swaying the mayor, noting, "Other redesigned streets... all get safer and they work better." The timeline is now unclear.

The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster.
