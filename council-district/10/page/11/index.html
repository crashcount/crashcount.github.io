The driver struck a 29-year-old woman on her bike, then ran. The officers checked her, then left. The car sat empty. The street stayed the same. Neighbors watched. One said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 10 saw <strong>1,204 crashes</strong>. <strong>Sixteen people were seriously hurt</strong>. <strong>665 were injured</strong>. No one died this year—luck, not policy. Last year, two people died. The year before, more. The numbers do not rest.</p><h3 id=the-toll-on-the-vulnerable>The Toll on the Vulnerable</h3><p>The wounded are young and old. Forty children under 18 were hurt this year. Cyclists and walkers take the worst of it. The intersection at Cabrini is a funnel for bike traffic from the bridge. It is a trap. A man named Jordan said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem.&rdquo;</a></p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. <strong>388 injuries and deaths</strong> came from cars and SUVs. <strong>22</strong> from motorcycles and mopeds. <strong>13</strong> from bikes. The street is not safe for anyone without steel around them.</p><h3 id=council-member-de-la-rosa-action-and-delay>Council Member De La Rosa: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, forcing the city to clear sightlines at 1,000 intersections a year. The <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill sits in committee</a>. The city moves slow. The cars do not. There is no record of De La Rosa leading on speed limits, protected bike lanes, or the worst repeat offenders. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another crash.</strong> Call Council Member De La Rosa. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead.</p><p><strong>The street remembers. So should we.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The statement rebuts industry claims about throttle bans and powered trailer restrictions, clarifying that state law governs those issues.

The plan, shaped by controversy and negotiation, keeps two lanes of car and truck traffic in both directions from the Pulaski Bridge to Calyer Street during the day, with a flex lane for parking at night. South of Calyer, the road narrows to one lane each way, with protected bike lanes, loading zones, and offset crossings. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the compromise will 'save lives and make this corridor much easier to navigate for everyone, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.' He thanked Mayor Adams, elected officials, and the community for their support. Supporters call it the biggest safety change since Robert Moses widened the road. Opponents, like Keep McGuinness Moving, say it ignores community concerns. The redesign comes after years of advocacy following multiple deaths and injuries on the corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not tied to a council bill but a DOT initiative, expands northbound bike lanes from eight to ten feet on the upper section. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “This project will deliver much-needed safety upgrades to the Hell’s Kitchen corridor and help support more efficient transportation options.” Local advocate Christine Berthet praised the wider lanes, noting the old design could not safely carry regular bikes alongside cargo and e-bikes. The project adds pedestrian islands, dedicated left-turn lanes, and leading pedestrian intervals at key intersections. Berthet urged the city to install flex posts to keep drivers out of bike and pedestrian spaces, citing problems on nearby 11th Avenue. The changes aim to protect vulnerable road users but leave most space for cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'Greater use of cargo bikes will bring incredible environmental and safety benefits for New York City by reducing the number of large, high-polluting trucks on our streets.' Rodriguez added, 'Just two cargo bikes can replace one box truck, increasing safety and reducing CO2 emission by 14 tons per year.' The public comment period runs 30 days, with a hearing on September 13.

Rodriguez said, "[My] personal commitment as the commissioner of DOT [is] to do the best it can to continue doing my job to improve safety on McGuinness Boulevard." Mayor Adams reversed the plan after business opposition, despite support from every other elected official. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher blamed a small group for swaying the mayor, noting, "Other redesigned streets... all get safer and they work better." The timeline is now unclear.

The plan: install 15 large package lockers on city sidewalks to centralize deliveries. DOT says, "The lockers will centralize drop-off points, allowing carriers to make fewer truck trips." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the initiative will cut daily delivery truck trips and give New Yorkers a secure spot for packages. Sara Lind of Open Plans calls it "a creative solution for reducing the number of trucks circling the block and idling at the curb." Still, she warns, "sidewalks are already very crowded," and urges care to avoid worsening conditions for pedestrians. The pilot will test if lockers can reduce truck traffic and theft without squeezing out people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany.

Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez initially objected, citing concerns about driver speed, but supported the amended bill requiring physical barriers.

The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days.

The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster. Bike advocates and DOT say the change is vital to meet safety targets and reduce cyclist injuries, which drop by over 30 percent where bike lanes are built.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
