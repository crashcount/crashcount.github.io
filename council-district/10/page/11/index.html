Sixteen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Not one death this year—yet. But these numbers are not mercy. They are luck, and luck runs out.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit her, then ran. Neighbors watched. One said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> Another pleaded, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</a> The intersection is a wound that never heals.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> SUVs and cars do most of the damage. In three years, they killed two, left 15 with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Motorcycles and mopeds have left their mark, too. Bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction of the carnage from larger vehicles.</p><p>The young are not spared. Forty-one children were hurt in the past year. The old are broken, too—twenty injured, one seriously, among those over 75. The numbers do not lie. They only count.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to a bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, a move to clear sightlines and protect those on foot. It is a start, not a finish. The bill sits in committee. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the asphalt.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>Call De La Rosa. Call the Council. Demand more.</strong> Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand that every child, every elder, every cyclist, every walker gets home alive. The city will not save you unless you force its hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Key corridors saw dramatic reductions: 96 percent on Houston Street, 74 percent on North Conduit Boulevard, 68 percent on Bruckner Boulevard. Injuries fell at high-crash sites—45 percent on Tremont Avenue, 33 percent on Kings Highway, 16 percent on Queens Boulevard, 19 percent on Hylan Boulevard. Automated cameras issued over 3.7 million tickets, dwarfing police efforts. Despite progress, cyclist injuries are on pace for a record high, and advocates now push for city control over speed limits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not tied to a council bill but a DOT initiative, expands northbound bike lanes from eight to ten feet on the upper section. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “This project will deliver much-needed safety upgrades to the Hell’s Kitchen corridor and help support more efficient transportation options.” Local advocate Christine Berthet praised the wider lanes, noting the old design could not safely carry regular bikes alongside cargo and e-bikes. The project adds pedestrian islands, dedicated left-turn lanes, and leading pedestrian intervals at key intersections. Berthet urged the city to install flex posts to keep drivers out of bike and pedestrian spaces, citing problems on nearby 11th Avenue. The changes aim to protect vulnerable road users but leave most space for cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'Greater use of cargo bikes will bring incredible environmental and safety benefits for New York City by reducing the number of large, high-polluting trucks on our streets.' Rodriguez added, 'Just two cargo bikes can replace one box truck, increasing safety and reducing CO2 emission by 14 tons per year.' The public comment period runs 30 days, with a hearing on September 13.

Rodriguez said, "[My] personal commitment as the commissioner of DOT [is] to do the best it can to continue doing my job to improve safety on McGuinness Boulevard." Mayor Adams reversed the plan after business opposition, despite support from every other elected official. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher blamed a small group for swaying the mayor, noting, "Other redesigned streets... all get safer and they work better." The timeline is now unclear. In the past year, 82 crashes injured 35 people on the corridor.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the initiative will cut daily delivery truck trips and give New Yorkers a secure spot for packages. Sara Lind of Open Plans calls it "a creative solution for reducing the number of trucks circling the block and idling at the curb." Still, she warns, "sidewalks are already very crowded," and urges care to avoid worsening conditions for pedestrians.

Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany.

The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster.

The city also aims to halve transportation emissions by 2030 and remove polluting trucks from streets. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “New Yorkers must continue to adopt safe, sustainable, and efficient transportation.” Advocates, including Jolyse Race, pressed the administration to prioritize bus riders and meet legal mandates for bus lane mileage.
