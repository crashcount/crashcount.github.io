In the last twelve months alone, 486 neighbors were hurt in 945 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last summer, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st Street. A truck, parked and unmoving, became the last thing he saw. The record shows: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> was the cause. The helmet did not save him. The street did not forgive him. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><p>A 15-year-old on a moped died at Saint Nicholas and 185th. A 21-year-old woman burned to death as a passenger on 10th Avenue. The list goes on. Each crash a wound that never heals.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against the softest bodies.</p><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>). But for the families who lost someone, the numbers are cold comfort.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let NYC set its own speed limits and give crash victims a bill of rights. She backed a ban on parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines for walkers. She voted yes on warning decals in taxis to protect cyclists from getting doored (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act and other legislation</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets that put people before steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The blood is still fresh.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Rodriguez said DOT supports the intent but opposes the bills, citing staffing shortages and a need for flexibility. Brooks-Powers expressed disappointment: 'It sounds, unfortunately, like DOT is not supporting any of the bills.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized city austerity and shrinking staff.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We now have the proof that convenient access to carshare frees New Yorkers from the burden of car ownership—while helping to fight climate change.' The expansion follows a pilot that saw a 38.7 million mile annual drop in driving and a reduction in private car ownership among participants. Three companies—Zipcar, Getaround, and Truqit—will deploy vehicles in the new spaces.

The bill’s summary states, 'The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.' Liu, as the bill’s primary sponsor, emphasized that anyone found with a BAC over 0.05 would be charged with DWI. City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez joined the push, warning, 'Whether they are at 0.06 or 0.12 or 0.20, the consequences can be deadly.' Drunk driving caused 307 deaths in New York State in 2019, nearly a third of all fatal crashes. Utah’s adoption of a 0.05 BAC limit led to a 20% drop in fatal crashes in its first year.

The bill sits in committee. Drunk drivers killed 42 people last year. Officials talk tough but focus on drinking, not driving. The danger remains for those outside the car.</p><p class=mb3>Senate and Assembly bill, sponsored by Sen. John Liu and Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, seeks to lower New York’s drunk driving threshold from 0.08 to 0.05 percent BAC. Announced at a December 22, 2022 press conference, the bill has stalled in committee for years. The matter aims to redefine DWI: 'driving while intoxicated would be defined as anything above a blood-alcohol content of 0.05 percent.' Simon and Liu back the measure; city DOT and NYPD leaders joined them. DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' In 2021, 42 people died in drunk driving crashes, up 60 percent from previous years. Officials promise enforcement and education, but their messaging targets drinking, not the act of driving. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while the law lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation cut Jamaica Avenue’s busway hours from 24/7 to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, while Archer Avenue remains round-the-clock. The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'NYC DOT proposal for car-free Grand Army Plaza and related street safety improvements,' is not a formal council bill but has drawn council attention. Council Member Shahana Hanif (District 39) and Crystal Hudson pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to address the plaza’s 'endless traffic, poor sidewalk conditions, broken benches, and overflowing trash cans.' Hanif and Hudson demanded immediate safety upgrades after recent crashes injured pedestrians and cyclists. DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton said, 'We want to take it to the next level... more consistent and better designed public spaces.' The agency is seeking public feedback and plans to draft detailed designs within the year. The proposal aims to end the status quo of danger and disrepair, prioritizing vulnerable road users over cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
