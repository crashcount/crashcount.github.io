On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe.

That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The portal lets users pinpoint and describe street obstructions. Councilmember Amanda Farías of District 18, who is mentioned in connection with the launch, stated, 'Double-parking is a chronic issue throughout our city, and is one of the largest quality of life issues facing my district everyday.' She added, 'It is not only illegal to double-park your car, but it puts others in danger when neighbors are unable to cross traffic safely, congestion is added to our streets, crossways and bike lanes are blocked, and emergency vehicles cannot respond in time.' The portal aims to collect data on dangerous spots, focusing city attention on hazards that threaten pedestrians, cyclists, and emergency response.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s matter title: 'The Department of Transportation must study the safety benefits of 'daylighting' and implement the street safety measure that helps improve visibility at a minimum of 100 intersections each year.' Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez initially objected, citing concerns about driver speed, but supported the amended bill requiring physical barriers. The law comes after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a non-daylighted intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the Council, 'We love Lincoln Restler's bill,' and called the old law 'unnecessarily burdensome.' The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster. Bike advocates and DOT say the change is vital to meet safety targets and reduce cyclist injuries, which drop by over 30 percent where bike lanes are built.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Key measures include expanding protected bike and bus lanes, growing e-scooter and e-bike share, implementing congestion pricing, and adding thousands of secure bike parking spots starting in 2025. The city also aims to halve transportation emissions by 2030 and remove polluting trucks from streets. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “New Yorkers must continue to adopt safe, sustainable, and efficient transportation.” Advocates, including Jolyse Race, pressed the administration to prioritize bus riders and meet legal mandates for bus lane mileage.

Holden wrote to DOT demanding action. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that the employee was identified and that 'appropriate action' was taken, but did not specify what that meant. The city car involved has five enforcement camera tickets since 2018. Holden stated, 'the DOT should expect nothing less than exemplary behavior from its personnel.' He commended DOT for swift action but transparency is lacking. Holden has opposed Citi Bike expansion and the Streets Master Plan, but supports NYPD enforcement against illegal parking and some safety improvements. The lack of detail on discipline leaves questions about accountability and the safety of pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states: 'The city will launch a pilot program testing neighborhood delivery microhubs across the five boroughs, aimed at reducing the surge of truck traffic.' Councilmember Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, representing District 31, emphasized the need for sustainable infrastructure to curb environmental justice impacts from truck congestion. The program will allow large trucks to unload at designated hubs, shifting the final delivery leg to vans, cargo bikes, or carts. Details on locations and management are pending. After a year, DOT will review data and consider expansion, with a final report due in 2026.

Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'No loss of life on our streets is acceptable.' The DOT has already added curb extensions and new crosswalks. Community members, including Alex Duncan, argue that one signal is not enough and demand systemic safety changes along the corridor.

Council member Erik Bottcher called for similar changes on 10th and 11th Avenues. Local advocate Christine Berthet called the new space 'just like having air to breathe.' The redesign removed a car lane in a neighborhood where most households lack cars. Still, the use of paint over concrete means drivers, including NYPD, sometimes park illegally on pedestrian space.
