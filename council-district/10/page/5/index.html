On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe. On June 1, 2024, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on W 181st Street. These are not scenes. They are names we do not print.</p><p>The toll we carry</p><p>Since 2022, District 10 has <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>logged</a> 4,108 crashes, 2,143 injuries, 45 serious injuries, and 10 deaths. SUVs and sedans led the harm to people on foot; trucks and buses were a smaller share. The count does not slow.</p><p>City says it can act. It must act uptown.</p><p>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery, the city <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>moved</a> fast. “As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The warning was blunt: “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Ben Furnas. The Heights and Inwood have dangerous blocks too.</p><p>What your council member has done</p><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>, a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up daylighting barriers at intersections. That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

At a community meeting, Brooks-Powers said, "We’ve been trying to get [the bike lane] removed for three years. It wasn’t supported by the community. ... In effect it’s not a bike lane quite honestly; no one uses it, they [drivers] park there. We would like to see the hard infrastructure removed." Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that building safe bike lanes requires support from local leaders.

The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mopeds remain banned from the Queensboro’s upper roadway. A public hearing is scheduled for April 14.

The crash occurred as the sedan’s right side door was opened directly into the cyclist’s path. The report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The cyclist, a 25-year-old man, was conscious but bleeding heavily from his arm. The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s errors. The sedan was stationary, and its right rear quarter panel was damaged. The incident underscores the danger posed when drivers or passengers open doors without checking for oncoming cyclists, as detailed in the police narrative: 'No warning. Just metal, motion, and the sound of pain on pavement.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The program, covering 750 school zones, needs state approval before June. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls speed cameras 'one of the most effective tools' to stop deadly driving. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who sponsored the last reauthorization, says, 'my bill to expand the speed camera program has saved lives.' The city wants stronger penalties for repeat offenders and action on license plate fraud, which lets millions of violations go unpunished. The report shows cameras cut speeding by 94 percent and reduce injuries and deaths. The program faces political hurdles, but the evidence is clear: speed cameras protect people on foot and bike. Lawmakers must decide whether to keep this life-saving tool.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Granite blocks, bike racks, and barriers will guard corners. Most pedestrian deaths happen at intersections. The city has ignored its own parking ban. Activists demand real change. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On January 17, 2025, Mayor Eric Adams proposed a budget boost to $3.85 million per year for 'hardened daylighting' at intersections. The plan, detailed by City Hall's Office of Management and Budget, aims to install granite blocks, bike racks, and other barriers at hundreds of corners. Adams said, 'We are ... keeping New Yorkers safe on our streets ... by improving road safety at hundreds of targeted traffic intersections.' State law bans parking within 20 feet of intersections, but New York City exempts itself, fueling deadly crashes—55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries happen at intersections. Council members and grassroots activists are pushing to end the city's carveout and require the Department of Transportation to add barriers to 1,000 intersections a year. Jackson Chabot of Open Plans said, 'Hardening is what makes daylighting actually work, so the budget item is really crucial to expanding it across the city.' The push follows the 2023 death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a poorly designed corner. The fight for safer streets is far from over.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
