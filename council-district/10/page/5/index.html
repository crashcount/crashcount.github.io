In the last twelve months alone, 486 neighbors were hurt in 945 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last summer, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st Street. A truck, parked and unmoving, became the last thing he saw. The record shows: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> was the cause. The helmet did not save him. The street did not forgive him. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><p>A 15-year-old on a moped died at Saint Nicholas and 185th. A 21-year-old woman burned to death as a passenger on 10th Avenue. The list goes on. Each crash a wound that never heals.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against the softest bodies.</p><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>). But for the families who lost someone, the numbers are cold comfort.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let NYC set its own speed limits and give crash victims a bill of rights. She backed a ban on parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines for walkers. She voted yes on warning decals in taxis to protect cyclists from getting doored (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act and other legislation</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets that put people before steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The blood is still fresh.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

Council Member Yusef Salaam leads as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, De La Rosa, Brooks-Powers, Cabán, Brannan, and Hanif. The bill demands at least five marked sites per borough, targeting places with the most injuries and deaths from bad driving. After the pilot, the city must report on results and recommend next steps. The law sunsets when the pilot ends.

The matter: 'What role did a single bike lane play in Ingrid Lewis-Martin's undoing?' Lewis-Martin, Mayor Adams’s closest advisor, fought the road diet and bike lane, siding with Broadway Stages and its CEO Gina Argento, who opposed the plan. Under their pressure, Adams abandoned the Department of Transportation’s safety design.

Brewer opposes citywide licensing and registration of all e-bikes, a measure supported by Councilman Bob Holden, calling it impractical. Instead, she urges the City Council to target commercial e-bike use by requiring delivery giants like Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub, and Amazon to track their contractors’ speed, direction, and sidewalk riding, and report violations to city regulators. Brewer also proposes a 15 mph speed limit for e-bikes and mandates running lights for visibility. She highlights the danger of unsafe lithium-ion batteries and calls for stricter oversight. Brewer’s approach shifts responsibility from individual riders to the corporations profiting from delivery, aiming to protect the city’s 8 million pedestrians from reckless riding and battery fires.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Concrete upgrades loom, but mountable curbs may let cars intrude.</p><p class=mb3>On November 13, 2024, the Department of Transportation celebrated a decade of safety improvements on Queens Boulevard. The event marked the completion of protected bike lanes along nearly the entire corridor, except for one block. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Several elements of this redesign aim at enhancing safety for all road users: Curbside bike lanes to enhance cyclist safety, pedestrian islands to shorten crossing distances while encouraging slower, safe turns, and additional adjustments to traffic signal timing to allow more time for pedestrians to cross before the lights turn green." The project, begun in 2015 under Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced local opposition and political delays but persisted. The city reports a 68 percent drop in traffic fatalities and a 35 percent reduction in pedestrian injuries since the redesign began. Cyclist numbers surged by 450 percent. DOT plans to upgrade bike lanes with concrete, but mountable curbs could leave lanes exposed to cars. Families for Safe Streets activist Lizi Rahman called the redesign a model for dangerous roads everywhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, part of Vision Zero, was celebrated in Council District 26 with Council Member Julie Won present and helping secure $1.5 million for future upgrades. The redesign stretches from Queens Plaza to Hillside Avenue, creating the city’s longest protected bike lane. The DOT reports a 68% drop in fatalities and a 35% reduction in injuries since 2015. The redesign adds parking-protected bike lanes, pedestrian islands, and improved signals. The next phase, funded in part by Won, will replace painted lanes with concrete, add raised medians, and increase accessibility.

The Council passed it on October 23, 2024; it became law November 22, 2024, as Local Law 113. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the department of transportation posting information on traffic-control device and speed reducer requests on its website.” Council Member Kalman Yeger led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law orders DOT to publish every request for traffic signals and speed humps—case number, subject, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial, and timeline if approved. The public can now track what the city does, or fails to do, when streets need taming. This transparency exposes the machinery behind every crosswalk, signal, and speed bump—vital for anyone who walks, bikes, or rides in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city left the southernmost block, between Hanson Place and Lafayette Avenue, without a protected bike lane. As activists from Transportation Alternatives wrote, this block 'does not work for anyone on the street and is the missing link in an otherwise protected bike lane.' Council members are not named, but the campaign targets Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Residents supported the full plan, but the city caved to real estate and institutional pressure, keeping two-way car traffic and exposing cyclists to danger. Crash data shows injuries persist. Activists urge the city to close the gap before the painting season ends.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not tied to a specific bill number, is led by the Department of Transportation and replaces a traffic lane in each direction between West End Avenue and 2nd Avenue. The matter aims to 'speed up crosstown buses like the M96 and M106.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, has sided with residents opposing the change, though she did not comment for the record. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the new lane will make commutes 'faster, more reliable, and safer for everyone.' The bus lane will operate 24/7, except for a short eastbound stretch. DOT notes that 74% of 96th Street residents do not own cars, and most commute by transit, bike, or foot. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
