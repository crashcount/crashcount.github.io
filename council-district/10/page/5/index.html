Sixteen serious injuries. Over 500 hurt.</strong> That’s just the last year in District 10. The names are gone from the data, but the wounds remain. A cyclist crushed on West 181st. A 15-year-old thrown from a moped on Saint Nicholas. A woman’s arm torn off by a distracted driver. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h2 id=when-help-never-comes>When Help Never Comes</h2><p>In April, Francisco Guzman Parra burned to death in his car after a police chase ended in flames on Dyckman Street. Officers arrived, saw the fire, and drove away. No help. No call for aid. His stepmother said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance.&rdquo;</a> The family waited for answers.

She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street.</p><p>But De La Rosa also sponsored a bill to slash taxi injury insurance, a move that would leave crash victims with less support and more pain. Survivors <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/12/opinion-weakening-injury-insurance-coverage-for-cabbies-will-harm-victims-of-road-violence>warned the Council</a>, &ldquo;The minimum $50,000 no fault insurance was exhausted within the first week or so of my hospitalization.&rdquo; The bill is still alive. The risk remains.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> Every week brings new crashes. Every day, another family waits for a call that never should come. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and protect the most vulnerable. It is time to use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets. Demand action, not excuses.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter states: 'The city has done a terrific job of making wise investments in improving mobility on both sides of the Harlem River, but left the bridge with just two very narrow, poorly lit lanes for foot and bike traffic.' Stevens and her colleagues stress that the bridge is unsafe for people on foot and bike. They urge DOT to act, citing the need to reduce traffic deaths and make the bridge safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Carmen N. De La Rosa led as primary sponsor, joined by Salamanca, Louis, Brewer, Joseph, Yeger, Dinowitz, and Sanchez.
