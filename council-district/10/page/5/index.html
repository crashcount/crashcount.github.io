On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe. On June 1, 2024, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on W 181st Street. These are not scenes. They are names we do not print.</p><p>The toll we carry</p><p>Since 2022, District 10 has <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>logged</a> 4,108 crashes, 2,143 injuries, 45 serious injuries, and 10 deaths. SUVs and sedans led the harm to people on foot; trucks and buses were a smaller share. The count does not slow.</p><p>City says it can act. It must act uptown.</p><p>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery, the city <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>moved</a> fast. “As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The warning was blunt: “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Ben Furnas. The Heights and Inwood have dangerous blocks too.</p><p>What your council member has done</p><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>, a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up daylighting barriers at intersections. That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt.

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws. Some opposition remains, but supporters say the measure is urgent and practical.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight over who belongs on city roads rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On March 27, 2025, mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo supported a Republican-backed proposal to require registration and license plates for all e-bikes in New York City. The plan, not yet introduced as a formal bill, would cost $20 million, according to the Department of Transportation. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from e-bike users, advocates, and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The matter centers on Cuomo's claim that registration will address 'chaos and promote safety.' Critics, including Queens cycling advocate Jim Burke and safe streets organizer Noel Hidalgo, argue the measure 'demonizes' e-bike users and ignores the real danger: reckless driving by motorists. Advocates say the plan would harm families, seniors, and delivery workers who rely on e-bikes, especially in transit deserts. They urge lawmakers to focus on street design and car enforcement, not new restrictions. The proposal has not advanced to committee or vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In effect it’s not a bike lane quite honestly; no one uses it, they [drivers] park there. We would like to see the hard infrastructure removed." Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians.

The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy aims to move mopeds out of bike lanes and onto motor vehicle lanes, addressing hazardous mixing of modes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “This proposed rule change is about expanding safe, practical options for moped users.” The change responds to rising moped use, especially among delivery workers, and ongoing conflicts with cyclists and pedestrians. Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York support removing mopeds from bikeways but urge DOT to do more for moped safety. The DOT will not lower speed limits as part of the policy. Mopeds remain banned from the Queensboro’s upper roadway. A public hearing is scheduled for April 14.

Holden supports both city and state versions, stating, 'We need the state DMV to issue license plates for e-bikes.'

According to the police report, both vehicles were 'making right turn' when they crashed. The report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Turning Improperly' as contributing factors. The narrative describes the scene: 'Steel kissed steel. The Honda's side split. The BMW's nose crushed. Two young men, both 22, slumped inside, heads bleeding. Semiconscious. Silent. The speed still echoed in the wreckage.' The data shows both drivers were licensed and neither occupant was ejected. The focus remains on driver actions—unsafe speed and improper turning—as the root causes of this violent crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At school zones, speeding drops 94 percent. But the program expires soon. DOT Commissioner Rodriguez urges Albany to act. State Sen. Gounardes backs expansion. Cameras save lives. Delay risks more deaths. Lawmakers hold the key.</p><p class=mb3>Bill to reauthorize New York City's speed camera program is pending in Albany. The program, covering 750 school zones, needs state approval before June. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls speed cameras 'one of the most effective tools' to stop deadly driving. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who sponsored the last reauthorization, says, 'my bill to expand the speed camera program has saved lives.' The city wants stronger penalties for repeat offenders and action on license plate fraud, which lets millions of violations go unpunished. The report shows cameras cut speeding by 94 percent and reduce injuries and deaths. The program faces political hurdles, but the evidence is clear: speed cameras protect people on foot and bike. Lawmakers must decide whether to keep this life-saving tool.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
