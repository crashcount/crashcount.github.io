She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street.</p><p>But De La Rosa also sponsored a bill to slash taxi injury insurance, a move that would leave crash victims with less support and more pain. Survivors <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/12/opinion-weakening-injury-insurance-coverage-for-cabbies-will-harm-victims-of-road-violence>warned the Council</a>, &ldquo;The minimum $50,000 no fault insurance was exhausted within the first week or so of my hospitalization.&rdquo; The bill is still alive. The risk remains.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> Every week brings new crashes. Every day, another family waits for a call that never should come. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and protect the most vulnerable.
