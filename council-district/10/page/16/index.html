On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe. On June 1, 2024, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on W 181st Street. These are not scenes. They are names we do not print.</p><p>The toll we carry</p><p>Since 2022, District 10 has <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>logged</a> 4,108 crashes, 2,143 injuries, 45 serious injuries, and 10 deaths. SUVs and sedans led the harm to people on foot; trucks and buses were a smaller share. The count does not slow.</p><p>City says it can act. It must act uptown.</p><p>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery, the city <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>moved</a> fast. “As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The warning was blunt: “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Ben Furnas. The Heights and Inwood have dangerous blocks too.</p><p>What your council member has done</p><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>, a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up daylighting barriers at intersections. That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The statement reads: 'Closing any portion of Fordham Road to vehicular traffic will result in many negative consequences... creating endless gridlock and danger for pedestrians.' DOT proposals include full or partial busways, but local surveys show 86% of visitors already arrive by walking, bus, or train.

The report notes the rider wore a helmet. No other vehicles or people were involved. The crash left the rider in shock, alone on the road.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Advocates demanded action after a crash. Letters went unanswered. The city offered only bureaucracy. Pedestrians remain at risk while officials stall and streets stay open to traffic.</p><p class=mb3>On July 1, 2022, Arthur Piccolo of the Bowling Green Association urged the city to make Lower Broadway car-free on summer Sundays. The proposal, sent to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, cited low vehicle use and the area's attractions. Piccolo argued, 'The automotive quiet creates the perfect opportunity for the administration to prove its commitment to pedestrians.' The city responded only after media inquiry, with DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone stating the proposal is under review as part of the 'Broadway Vision' plan and inviting groups to apply to the Open Streets program. Piccolo dismissed this as 'bureaucratic nonsense.' The Mayor's Office declined comment. The proposal follows renewed calls for pedestrian safety after a serious crash on Broadway. No formal council bill or committee action is noted. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Carlina Rivera, was reviewed by the Transportation Committee. The matter title calls for 'a master plan to build and maintain a five-borough greenway network.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced strong support, stating, 'This administration welcomes this bill, which is in line with both our vision for a greener, more connected city.' Rivera criticized the current system: 'Many of New York's 100 miles of greenways exist only on paper with no cohesive city network.' The bill would require city agencies to present a plan by July 1 next year. It also shifts responsibility from City Planning to agencies that actually build and maintain greenways. Advocates say this could finally connect fragmented paths and bring safer routes to neighborhoods long left out.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement followed a spate of violence: 'Car drivers killed at least three people and injured seven others, including an 11-year-old boy.' The carnage included hit-and-runs, reckless driving, and unlicensed operators. Adams and Rodriguez said they are 'working every day to deliver true public safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and everyone who uses our streets.' They acknowledged recent progress but warned, 'the disturbing incidents we've seen in recent weeks and the last 48 hours remind us just how fragile those positive steps are and how much more work remains.' The city faces one of its most violent years since Vision Zero began. The numbers: 106 killed citywide in the first half of 2022, surpassing 2015. The crisis is not over.

The expansion doubles the number of scooters and extends service, but protected bike lanes in the new zone remain unfinished. Scooters are banned in some parks, cutting off access to the Ferry Point Park ferry terminal and Orchard Beach. DOT blames interdepartmental issues with the Parks Department. Rodriguez highlighted the pilot’s safety record: no fatalities, few injuries, and safety protocols like speed limits for new users. Residents voiced frustration over limited access.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "We are a data-driven administration. We are following the crashes. We are focusing on the most dangerous intersections." The plan targets 50 intersections per year with turn-calming treatments like plastic bollards, rubber speed bumps, and paint. It focuses on 'Senior Pedestrian Zones' with high injury rates, but leaves out some neighborhoods with large senior populations. The plan also expands Leading Pedestrian Intervals and promises at least 10 Senior Street Improvement Projects annually. Critics, including Second Avenue Sagas, slammed the slow pace: "Fifty a year sounds like pushing a boulder up a hill with a toothpick." Advocates call the plan a small step, but say it falls short as senior deaths continue.
