On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe. On June 1, 2024, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on W 181st Street. These are not scenes. They are names we do not print.</p><p>The toll we carry</p><p>Since 2022, District 10 has <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>logged</a> 4,108 crashes, 2,143 injuries, 45 serious injuries, and 10 deaths. SUVs and sedans led the harm to people on foot; trucks and buses were a smaller share. The count does not slow.</p><p>City says it can act. It must act uptown.</p><p>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery, the city <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>moved</a> fast. “As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The warning was blunt: “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Ben Furnas. The Heights and Inwood have dangerous blocks too.</p><p>What your council member has done</p><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>, a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up daylighting barriers at intersections. That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates demand more.</p><p class=mb3>On June 15, 2022, the Department of Transportation announced a senior pedestrian safety initiative. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "We are a data-driven administration. We are following the crashes. We are focusing on the most dangerous intersections." The plan targets 50 intersections per year with turn-calming treatments like plastic bollards, rubber speed bumps, and paint. It focuses on 'Senior Pedestrian Zones' with high injury rates, but leaves out some neighborhoods with large senior populations. The plan also expands Leading Pedestrian Intervals and promises at least 10 Senior Street Improvement Projects annually. Critics, including Second Avenue Sagas, slammed the slow pace: "Fifty a year sounds like pushing a boulder up a hill with a toothpick." Advocates call the plan a small step, but say it falls short as senior deaths continue. No council bill number or committee is attached; this is a DOT policy action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency will swap out heavy Jersey barriers for curb-height blocks, wave delineators, and armadillo-shaped bumps. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The Better Barriers pilot is an example of the innovative ways we are addressing traffic safety and improving our cycling network.' The pilot launches on Union Square East, with plans to expand. Mayor Adams and Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi both praised the creative push for safer streets. Advocacy groups like StreetsPAC and Open Plans welcomed the move but raised doubts about durability and the risk of partial barriers failing to keep lanes clear. Bike New York warned, 'simply putting barriers or partial barriers along the edges of the lanes isn’t sufficient to keep them clear.'

Rodriguez highlighted collaborations with students and a $1 billion budget for street safety, but did not commit to expanding car-free school streets. Advocates argue that closing streets to cars is the most effective way to protect children, a method rarely used in New York City. The city did not release a list of the 100 planned projects or specify how many are near schools.

The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July. Assembly Member William Magnarelli, chair of the Transportation Committee, blamed City Hall for inaction. Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo. Without home rule, New York City’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—face continued risk from political delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Transportation Alternatives report, 'Speeding Doesn’t Sleep,' warns that 59 percent of city road deaths occur when cameras are off. The report urges full-time operation, noting cameras cut speeding by 72 percent where installed. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls passage 'very important.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Governor Hochul support local control. Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives says, 'We need Albany to allow New York City to operate speed safety cameras 24/7 so every neighborhood is protected from speeding drivers every hour of the day, every day of the week.' Despite strong public support, the legislature has not acted. The evidence is stark: when cameras are off, people die.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan follows the City Council's push for a $3.1 billion, five-year budget. Adams said, 'We're making a historical announcement to continue to keep our streets safe.' Council Member Lincoln Restler called it 'a big, big, big day for street safety.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'We will be building even more bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes as well as new plaza and other public space.' The funding will upgrade weakly protected bike lanes and step up enforcement against reckless drivers. Advocates, including Transportation Alternatives, praised the move as transformational for vulnerable road users.

Nurse called the move 'a welcome relief to communities that have faced an unprecedented increase in litter during the pandemic.' The investment covers new equipment and staff, including a pilot fleet of 10 Micromobility Operations Machines to sweep narrow lanes. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine praised the smaller sweepers as 'a win for cyclists.' The funding appears in the Fiscal Year 2023 executive budget.

The press conference, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted the city's lack of ambition. Rodriguez said, 'We encourage all New Yorkers to embrace the streets and imagine what could be possible if we open our streets for more than just moving personal vehicles.' Yet, no new initiatives were announced. The event's limited scope drew sharp criticism. The article compared New York's effort to the Netherlands' 1970s 'car-free Sundays,' which led to real change. Here, the city offers a press release, not protection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, children—see little relief. The cars keep coming.
