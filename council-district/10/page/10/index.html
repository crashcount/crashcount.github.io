In the last twelve months alone, 486 neighbors were hurt in 945 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last summer, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st Street. A truck, parked and unmoving, became the last thing he saw. The record shows: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> was the cause. The helmet did not save him. The street did not forgive him. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><p>A 15-year-old on a moped died at Saint Nicholas and 185th. A 21-year-old woman burned to death as a passenger on 10th Avenue. The list goes on. Each crash a wound that never heals.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against the softest bodies.</p><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>). But for the families who lost someone, the numbers are cold comfort.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let NYC set its own speed limits and give crash victims a bill of rights. She backed a ban on parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines for walkers. She voted yes on warning decals in taxis to protect cyclists from getting doored (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act and other legislation</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets that put people before steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list.

Philip Miatkowski of Transportation Alternatives blames decades of policy that 'prioritize cars over people and leave behind our most vulnerable.' The data shows the Bronx had 23 percent more serious injuries per capita than the city average, Brooklyn 27 percent more, and Manhattan’s cyclist injuries were 77 percent higher per capita.

The plan, shaped by controversy and negotiation, keeps two lanes of car and truck traffic in both directions from the Pulaski Bridge to Calyer Street during the day, with a flex lane for parking at night. South of Calyer, the road narrows to one lane each way, with protected bike lanes, loading zones, and offset crossings. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the compromise will 'save lives and make this corridor much easier to navigate for everyone, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.' He thanked Mayor Adams, elected officials, and the community for their support. Supporters call it the biggest safety change since Robert Moses widened the road. Opponents, like Keep McGuinness Moving, say it ignores community concerns.

The plan, not tied to a council bill but a DOT initiative, expands northbound bike lanes from eight to ten feet on the upper section. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “This project will deliver much-needed safety upgrades to the Hell’s Kitchen corridor and help support more efficient transportation options.” Local advocate Christine Berthet praised the wider lanes, noting the old design could not safely carry regular bikes alongside cargo and e-bikes. The project adds pedestrian islands, dedicated left-turn lanes, and leading pedestrian intervals at key intersections. Berthet urged the city to install flex posts to keep drivers out of bike and pedestrian spaces, citing problems on nearby 11th Avenue. The changes aim to protect vulnerable road users but leave most space for cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City Hall listens to business, not victims.</p><p class=mb3>On July 18, 2023, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez addressed the status of the McGuinness Boulevard redesign. The $40 million plan, drafted in 2021 after a fatal hit-and-run, aimed to cut lanes from four to two, add protected bike lanes, and shorten crossings. Rodriguez said, "[My] personal commitment as the commissioner of DOT [is] to do the best it can to continue doing my job to improve safety on McGuinness Boulevard." Mayor Adams reversed the plan after business opposition, despite support from every other elected official. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher blamed a small group for swaying the mayor, noting, "Other redesigned streets... all get safer and they work better." The timeline is now unclear. In the past year, 82 crashes injured 35 people on the corridor. Advocates vow to keep fighting for the original, safer design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan: install 15 large package lockers on city sidewalks to centralize deliveries. DOT says, "The lockers will centralize drop-off points, allowing carriers to make fewer truck trips." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the initiative will cut daily delivery truck trips and give New Yorkers a secure spot for packages. Sara Lind of Open Plans calls it "a creative solution for reducing the number of trucks circling the block and idling at the curb." Still, she warns, "sidewalks are already very crowded," and urges care to avoid worsening conditions for pedestrians. The pilot will test if lockers can reduce truck traffic and theft without squeezing out people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The announcement, made at One Police Plaza, highlighted the bill sponsored by Simon and Sen. John Liu. The matter summary states, 'Officials called on Albany to pass legislation to lower the BAC threshold to .05%, arguing it would reduce DWI fatalities by about 10% and align with other countries.' Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany.

She added, 'It is not only illegal to double-park your car, but it puts others in danger when neighbors are unable to cross traffic safely, congestion is added to our streets, crossways and bike lanes are blocked, and emergency vehicles cannot respond in time.' The portal aims to collect data on dangerous spots, focusing city attention on hazards that threaten pedestrians, cyclists, and emergency response.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
