In the last twelve months alone, 486 neighbors were hurt in 945 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last summer, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st Street. A truck, parked and unmoving, became the last thing he saw. The record shows: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> was the cause. The helmet did not save him. The street did not forgive him. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><p>A 15-year-old on a moped died at Saint Nicholas and 185th. A 21-year-old woman burned to death as a passenger on 10th Avenue. The list goes on. Each crash a wound that never heals.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against the softest bodies.</p><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>). But for the families who lost someone, the numbers are cold comfort.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let NYC set its own speed limits and give crash victims a bill of rights. She backed a ban on parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines for walkers. She voted yes on warning decals in taxis to protect cyclists from getting doored (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act and other legislation</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets that put people before steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The blood is still fresh.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, now two years old as of October 25, 2022, has slashed traffic deaths and injuries. The matter summary states: 'the street has become much safer for all users as it has created dignified public space for all residents.' Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez led the ribbon-cutting. City officials are moving to make the changes permanent. In the last two years, there have been zero traffic deaths on 34th Avenue and a 43 percent drop in crashes in the surrounding area. Pedestrian and cyclist injuries have dropped by half, even as usage soared. Council Member Francisco Moya has not supported expanding Paseo Park into his district, leaving the project stalled at the border. The data show: open streets save lives, cut injuries, and give neighborhoods space to breathe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'business is booming along streets converted to outdoor dining strips or car-free open streets.' Rodriguez supports curbside dining, declaring, 'the future of New York City is going car free.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams disagrees, saying outdoor dining should stay on the sidewalk. Mayor Adams promises to keep the program as a 'critical driver of recovery.' The report found more business growth on open streets than on similar corridors, with gains in Astoria, Prospect Heights, and Chinatown. The council remains divided on the program’s permanent form.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The initiative, called 'Trick-or-Streets,' will close 100 streets—across all boroughs except Staten Island—from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. The DOT will extend hours on 40 existing open streets and keep another 60 car-free through the evening, partnering with the Street Activity Permit Office for more pedestrian zones. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'I am incredibly excited to build on the triumph of our thriving Open Streets program ... this Halloween, providing greater access to safer, shared community spaces.' Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and Council Member Shekar Krishnan backed the move, stressing the deadly risk cars pose to children. DOT data shows a 42% drop in pedestrian injury crashes on 34th Avenue since it went car-free. The city cites national spikes in child pedestrian deaths on Halloween. The message is clear: car-free streets save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates argue the shared lane is unsafe and often blocked by cars.

Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements.

Nearly 20% of top agency positions are vacant. The article, titled 'Just Keeping the Lights On,' details how these gaps cripple street safety and improvement projects. Key leadership roles—chief of staff, general counsel, communications director—remain unfilled. Employees blame city hiring policies, pandemic resignations, and weak leadership from Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. One former staffer says, 'We couldn't produce anything new. We were just keeping the lights on.' Another warns, 'The agency's ability to respond to severe injuries and fatalities is also limited and slow.' Political interference and lack of expertise at the top deepen the crisis. The result: fewer bus lanes, stalled bike infrastructure, and a city where vulnerable road users face mounting danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter calls for urgent upgrades to the 133-year-old Washington Bridge. The officials demand a two-way protected bike lane, wider pedestrian paths, improved lighting, and safety cameras. The letter states: 'The city has done a terrific job of making wise investments in improving mobility on both sides of the Harlem River, but left the bridge with just two very narrow, poorly lit lanes for foot and bike traffic.' Stevens and her colleagues stress that the bridge is unsafe for people on foot and bike. They urge DOT to act, citing the need to reduce traffic deaths and make the bridge safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation claims only 395 intersections improved since the January 19 announcement. Most changes were limited to signal timing (LPIs), not physical redesigns. The matter centers on the mayor’s vow to 'make expedient and substantive changes to dangerous intersections.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s earlier claims of progress are not supported by public data. Advocates like Liz Denys (Transportation Alternatives) and Sara Lind (Open Plans) criticize the slow pace and lack of real fixes. Lind urges, 'The city must allocate the resources needed for DOT to employ their full toolkit of redesign tools.' Council members and community boards are called to help identify and fix dangerous spots. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation said it would review the request. Advocates like Juan Restrepo and Jackson Chabot joined the call, demanding more hours and borough-wide access.

In eight months, the administration completed only 28 street redesigns near schools, out of 2,600 citywide. The Department of Transportation has 24 more projects underway. The matter summary states: 'the city's relatively minor investment in street safety upgrades will do little to mitigate the threats cars pose to children walking to and from city schools.' Council members and advocates, including Emily Stutts and Danny Harris, criticize the slow pace. Stutts says, 'It doesn’t feel like enough,' while Harris urges, 'Mayor Adams and DOT need to expand this program now to save lives.' The city expanded school-zone speed cameras to 24/7 and increased open streets for schools to 47, but this covers only a fraction of schools. Advocates demand aggressive Vision Zero action, citing rising child fatalities and persistent danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
