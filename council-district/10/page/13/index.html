On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe.

That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pledged to bring this design citywide, stating, 'While we are excited to bring this improvement to Hells Kitchen, we look forward to expanding these efforts elsewhere.' Council member Erik Bottcher called for similar changes on 10th and 11th Avenues. Local advocate Christine Berthet called the new space 'just like having air to breathe.' The redesign removed a car lane in a neighborhood where most households lack cars. Still, the use of paint over concrete means drivers, including NYPD, sometimes park illegally on pedestrian space. DOT says it will work with police to protect these 'sacred spaces.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say low fees fuel car ownership, crowding out transit, bikes, and green space. Experts warn it’s a subsidy for drivers, not a fix for congestion or emissions.</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2023, a Senate proposal surfaced to create a Residential Parking Permit system in New York City. The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Action is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2023, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced an $18-million federal grant for redesigning Delancey Street, using most of a $21-million citywide safety fund. The project, still in the design phase, will add separated bike lanes, accessibility upgrades, and a road diet—measures meant to calm traffic and protect vulnerable road users. Gillibrand referenced the 2012 death of 12-year-old Dashane Santana and said, 'We need to do much better.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a 'citywide commitment' and said it would 'completely change the feel of Delancey Street, making it safer and more welcoming.' Since 2019, 799 crashes have injured 279 people here, including 69 cyclists and 48 pedestrians. Despite past improvements, injury rates have not dropped. The new plan aims to finally break that cycle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The message: don’t drink and drive.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2023, Queens State Senator John Liu, representing District 16, publicly supported a bill in the State Legislature to lower the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for drivers from 0.08 to 0.05. The bill’s summary states, 'The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.' Liu, as the bill’s primary sponsor, emphasized that anyone found with a BAC over 0.05 would be charged with DWI. City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez joined the push, warning, 'Whether they are at 0.06 or 0.12 or 0.20, the consequences can be deadly.' Drunk driving caused 307 deaths in New York State in 2019, nearly a third of all fatal crashes. Utah’s adoption of a 0.05 BAC limit led to a 20% drop in fatal crashes in its first year. The bill is part of a broader effort to protect pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, funded by the Safe Streets and Roads for All program, will reduce traffic lanes, add protected bike paths, and improve accessibility between Clinton and Bowery Streets. The announcement follows years of crashes—38 killed or severely injured from 2016 to 2020, and 200 crashes in a decade. Council Member Carlina Rivera (District 2) was mentioned in the announcement. Council Member Christopher Marte called the road a 'crisis.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the redesign focuses on a hazardous stretch heavily used by pedestrians and cyclists. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, 'Old folks, toddlers, workers and students shouldn’t have to fear for their lives.'

Joseph expressed disappointment: 'New Yorkers deserve to know how the DOT is working to make school streets safer.' Councilmember Shahana Hanif also criticized DOT’s inability to track safety projects. Despite Commissioner Rodriguez’s promise of 100 safety projects, the agency denied a FOIL request, claiming costs are not tracked. Advocates and families condemned the lack of accountability.

The project, begun in September 2021 and finished last fall, added 1,285 square feet of sidewalk, a new median, and red bus-only lanes on Westchester Avenue. The DOT worked with the MTA to cut a circuitous bus detour, giving Bx12 and other riders a direct path. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'DOT’s work at Pelham Bay Park... may be only one-10th of a mile, but the impact for thousands of riders will be gigantic.' New York City Transit President Richard Davey added, 'Bus lanes don't have to be miles long to deliver a huge impact.' The changes serve 64,000 daily riders, expanding space for pedestrians and shortening bus trips. More crosswalks now connect the busy transfer point, making the area less hostile for those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
