But they do not lie. <strong>Ten people killed. Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In three years, 3,688 crashes tore through these streets. <strong>One cyclist dead on West 181st, struck by a truck while riding at night. A 15-year-old thrown from a moped on Saint Nicholas Avenue, never to come home.</strong></p><p>The wounds are not just numbers. A mother waits for a son who will never walk through the door. A cyclist’s helmet lies cracked on the curb. <strong>SUVs and cars led the body count, with two pedestrian deaths and over a hundred serious injuries.</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has backed some measures that matter. She co-sponsored the push for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Sammy’s Law</a>, giving the city power to lower speed limits. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She fought for <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/washington-bridge-between-manhattan-and-bronx-gets-bus-and-protected-bike-lanes>protected bike lanes on the Washington Bridge</a>, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been so afraid to walk a bridge on foot&mldr; it was an accident waiting to happen.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/washington-bridge-between-manhattan-and-bronx-gets-bus-and-protected-bike-lanes>Washington Bridge upgrades</a></p><p>But not every move protects the vulnerable.

As nurse and crash survivor Lauren Pine <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/12/opinion-weakening-injury-insurance-coverage-for-cabbies-will-harm-victims-of-road-violence>warned</a>, &ldquo;The minimum $50,000 no fault insurance was exhausted within the first week or so of my hospitalization.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Speed and inattention still kill.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to redesign streets and keep cars away from crosswalks. But every delay means another family shattered. <strong>Contact Council Member De La Rosa. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand full insurance for victims. Demand streets where children can cross without fear.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike.

The bill, now under review by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), has four sponsors. The measure’s summary reads: lowering PIP would match the statewide standard, but critics argue it leaves crash victims exposed. De La Rosa claims high premiums burden drivers, saying, 'The interest for me in carrying this bill comes from the plight of these drivers.' Experts like Bruce Schaller and Sam Schwartz warn $50,000 is far too little for New York’s high crash costs, especially for pedestrians and cyclists who lack their own insurance. Former TLC commissioner Matt Daus urges caution, noting the risk of catastrophic impacts on victims. The bill’s fate remains undecided as debate continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

De La Rosa, who represents the area, said, 'I've never been so afraid to walk a bridge on foot... it was an accident waiting to happen.' The overhaul separates cyclists and pedestrians from cars with jersey barriers and fences, and adds protected pedestrian paths. Automated cameras will enforce the bus lane.
