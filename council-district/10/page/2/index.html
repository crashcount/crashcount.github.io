In the last twelve months alone, 486 neighbors were hurt in 945 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last summer, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st Street. A truck, parked and unmoving, became the last thing he saw. The record shows: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> was the cause. The helmet did not save him. The street did not forgive him. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><p>A 15-year-old on a moped died at Saint Nicholas and 185th. A 21-year-old woman burned to death as a passenger on 10th Avenue. The list goes on. Each crash a wound that never heals.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against the softest bodies.</p><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>). But for the families who lost someone, the numbers are cold comfort.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let NYC set its own speed limits and give crash victims a bill of rights. She backed a ban on parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines for walkers. She voted yes on warning decals in taxis to protect cyclists from getting doored (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act and other legislation</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets that put people before steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The blood is still fresh.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, reported by Brooklyn Paper, aims to 'improve pedestrian and cyclist safety' by installing hardened daylighting—physical barriers like granite blocks and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' No council member sponsored this; it is a DOT initiative. Safety advocates, including Jackson Chabot of Open Plans, support the move but urge faster, broader action. According to safety analysts, hardened daylighting physically prevents vehicles from blocking sightlines, reducing conflicts and crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists, and supports system-wide safety improvements without burdening vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Wider sidewalks. Shorter crossings. More trees. The city pours $400 million into a stretch from Bryant Park to Central Park. Construction waits until 2028. The street will shift for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on May 21, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams announced a $400 million investment to redesign Fifth Avenue between Bryant Park and Central Park. The plan, called 'The Future of Fifth,' will double sidewalk space, shorten crosswalks, and add over 230 tree planters. Adams said, 'We're making Fifth Avenue more walkable, greener and safer.' The project aims to address sidewalk congestion and improve safety for pedestrians. City Councilmember Keith Powers noted, 'you can feel congestion on the sidewalks.' Construction is set to begin in 2028. The redesign signals a shift in city policy, prioritizing vulnerable road users and reclaiming space from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Federal Secretary Duffy objects. Critics say his stance ignores history and safety. The bridge once belonged to walkers. Now, the city returns space to people, not cars. Tensions flare. Vulnerable users watch.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the Adams administration's move to open a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge. The event, not a council bill but a city action, drew sharp criticism from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who opposed removing a vehicle lane for pedestrians and cyclists. The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.' Still, the move restores space to those on foot and bike, challenging car dominance and federal resistance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer (District 6) took a public stance against the NYPD’s surge in criminal summonses for e-bike violations. In her editorial, Brewer wrote, 'Regulation, not criminal summonses, makes sense.' She condemned the 4,000% spike in summonses, highlighting the grave risks these pose to immigrant delivery workers, who face potential deportation for minor traffic infractions. Brewer argued that unsafe riding stems from unrealistic delivery deadlines set by companies like Grubhub and Uber, not from inherent recklessness. She called for regulation targeting delivery app practices and for companies to set realistic delivery times and prioritize safety. Brewer’s position: punish the companies, not the workers. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Delivery workers, mostly immigrants, bore the brunt.</p><p class=mb3>On April 28, 2025, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch launched a new policy targeting cyclists with criminal summonses for minor traffic violations. In just two weeks, police issued more than 900 summonses—far surpassing the 553 issued in all of 2024. The Department of Transportation (DOT), led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, was not informed. The matter drew sharp criticism from former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman, who questioned why cyclists face harsher penalties than drivers: 'A car that runs a red light doesn't get a criminal violation, so why would a bike?' Government watchdogs and advocates, including Ben Furnas and Jon Orcutt, condemned the lack of coordination and the disproportionate enforcement. Many tickets targeted delivery workers, a group largely made up of immigrants. Critics argue the crackdown is excessive and fails to address the real dangers on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Starting May 18, the north outer roadway becomes bike-only, while the south outer roadway, once for vehicles, opens to pedestrians. The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays. The change doubles space for non-drivers and removes a vehicle lane, addressing years of systemic risk from forced mixing of vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a city-funded public engagement process for a major safety redesign of Conduit Boulevard, a three-mile corridor linking Atlantic Avenue to the Belt Parkway and JFK Airport. The project follows urgent requests in 2023 from Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch. The public process begins in June and may run into 2026. The redesign aims to end decades of danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
