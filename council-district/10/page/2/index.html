Sixteen serious injuries. Over 500 hurt.</strong> That’s just the last year in District 10. The names are gone from the data, but the wounds remain. A cyclist crushed on West 181st. A 15-year-old thrown from a moped on Saint Nicholas. A woman’s arm torn off by a distracted driver. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h2 id=when-help-never-comes>When Help Never Comes</h2><p>In April, Francisco Guzman Parra burned to death in his car after a police chase ended in flames on Dyckman Street.

She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street.</p><p>But De La Rosa also sponsored a bill to slash taxi injury insurance, a move that would leave crash victims with less support and more pain. Survivors <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/12/opinion-weakening-injury-insurance-coverage-for-cabbies-will-harm-victims-of-road-violence>warned the Council</a>, &ldquo;The minimum $50,000 no fault insurance was exhausted within the first week or so of my hospitalization.&rdquo; The bill is still alive. The risk remains.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> Every week brings new crashes. Every day, another family waits for a call that never should come. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and protect the most vulnerable. It is time to use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets.

The bill, now under review by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), has four sponsors. The measure’s summary reads: lowering PIP would match the statewide standard, but critics argue it leaves crash victims exposed. De La Rosa claims high premiums burden drivers, saying, 'The interest for me in carrying this bill comes from the plight of these drivers.' Experts like Bruce Schaller and Sam Schwartz warn $50,000 is far too little for New York’s high crash costs, especially for pedestrians and cyclists who lack their own insurance. Former TLC commissioner Matt Daus urges caution, noting the risk of catastrophic impacts on victims. The bill’s fate remains undecided as debate continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city pushes Albany to let it set its own pace.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0079-2024, adopted June 6, 2024 by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, urges the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.315/A.1416. The measure would let New York City set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets in the Open Streets program. The matter title reads: 'authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Carlina Rivera. The committee approved the resolution with strong support. The bill targets streets where pedestrians and cyclists mix with traffic. Lower speeds mean fewer crashes and less severe injuries. The council’s action puts pressure on Albany to give the city the power to protect people where they are most exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
