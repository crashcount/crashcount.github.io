On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe. On June 1, 2024, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on W 181st Street. These are not scenes. They are names we do not print.</p><p>The toll we carry</p><p>Since 2022, District 10 has <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>logged</a> 4,108 crashes, 2,143 injuries, 45 serious injuries, and 10 deaths. SUVs and sedans led the harm to people on foot; trucks and buses were a smaller share. The count does not slow.</p><p>City says it can act. It must act uptown.</p><p>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery, the city <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>moved</a> fast. “As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The warning was blunt: “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said</a> Ben Furnas. The Heights and Inwood have dangerous blocks too.</p><p>What your council member has done</p><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>, a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up daylighting barriers at intersections. That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The moped driver, a 36-year-old man, was partially ejected and injured. The SUV driver held only a permit. Helmet use was noted for the moped driver, but only after the listed driver errors.

Bottcher called it 'transformative,' promising fewer crashes and faster buses. Powers slammed the last-minute reversal.

The redesign took 18 feet from each side for decks and seating, adding over 4,000 square feet for people.

Council Members Lincoln Restler and Chi Ossé condemned the move, calling it reckless and political. Brad Lander and Zohran Mamdani joined in opposition.
