Ten people have died on these streets since 2022. Forty-three more suffered serious injuries. In the last year alone, 660 neighbors were hurt in 1,196 crashes. No one is spared—children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians. The violence is relentless.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was killed on West 181st Street, his chest crushed, his life ended by a truck <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to city data</a>. Last fall, a 15-year-old on a moped died at St. Nicholas Avenue, thrown from his seat, crushed by an SUV. The street does not forgive. The numbers keep climbing.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>Each crash leaves a scar—a mother, a son, a friend. The pain is not abstract. It is a name, a body, a family left behind. &ldquo;Kirk was taken from me just as we were starting our new life together. He was the love of my life,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/27/us-news/drunk-teen-jimmy-connors-killed-groom-to-be-kirk-walker-in-wrong-way-crash-after-night-out-at-nyc-club-new-suit-alleges/>said Shauntea Weaver</a> after a wrong-way crash killed her fiancé the day before their wedding.</p><p>The violence is not fate. It is the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who design and police these streets.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has taken steps. She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines and protect those on foot and bike <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>according to council records</a>. But the bill sits in committee, waiting. The city moves slow.

But cameras alone are not enough. The dead cannot wait for another study, another delay.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The crisis is not over. The next victim is already walking. Call Council Member De La Rosa. Demand action. Demand safer speeds, daylighted intersections, and streets built for people, not cars.

The project, first proposed in spring 2023, will run northbound from Dean Street to Flushing Avenue. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "The addition of a parking-protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue will create a critical cycling link in an area where bicycle ridership is booming, while making the road safer for everyone." City Council Member Chi Oss, who criticized delays, now calls the project "a win for everyone." The plan uses concrete barriers, flex-posts, and painted pedestrian islands to shield vulnerable users. Since 2020, five pedestrians have died on this stretch. The project responds to years of advocacy and high crash rates, aiming to protect walkers and cyclists in a busy, dangerous corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods.

The letter, signed by outgoing NYCT President Richard Davey and interim successor Demetrius Crichlow, called the city’s paint-and-enforcement approach a 'total bust.' The MTA cited new data showing bus speeds increased just 2–4 percent since October 2022—far below the 15 percent target. The matter summary reads: 'The Fordham Road project enjoys widespread support from transit advocacy groups, and Fordham Road bus riders, who have been enduring slow service for decades.' Council involvement is not specified, but the MTA’s letter and Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein both demand stronger measures.

The matter, described as a 'massive scaleback,' drew criticism from advocates and business owners. Jackson Chabot of Open Plans said, 'It’s mind boggling that New York City is actually regressing back to more car-centered streets.' Restaurateurs like Charlotta Janssen and Robert Sanfiz warned that new seasonal rules and costly storage will force many to abandon outdoor dining.

Only 1,300 restaurants applied for permits, compared to 12,500 during the pandemic. The City Council and Mayor Adams changed the law, allowing roadway dining only seasonally. Eateries must set up each March and tear down by December, a heavy lift for small businesses. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, issued a 'last call' for applications. Rodriguez said, 'Outdoor dining enriches our communities, and we're excited to make it a permanent feature of New York City streets.' Yet, only 23 roadway setups are pending approval. Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans argue the city should allow year-round use, calling the decline a missed opportunity for public space and safety. The new design rules—no roofs or sides—leave some owners feeling exposed and unsafe. The city’s move shifts space back to cars, shrinking safe zones for pedestrians and diners.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push.
