But they do not lie. <strong>Ten people killed. Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In three years, 3,688 crashes tore through these streets. <strong>One cyclist dead on West 181st, struck by a truck while riding at night. A 15-year-old thrown from a moped on Saint Nicholas Avenue, never to come home.</strong></p><p>The wounds are not just numbers. A mother waits for a son who will never walk through the door. A cyclist’s helmet lies cracked on the curb. <strong>SUVs and cars led the body count, with two pedestrian deaths and over a hundred serious injuries.</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has backed some measures that matter. She co-sponsored the push for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Sammy’s Law</a>, giving the city power to lower speed limits. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She fought for <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/washington-bridge-between-manhattan-and-bronx-gets-bus-and-protected-bike-lanes>protected bike lanes on the Washington Bridge</a>, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been so afraid to walk a bridge on foot&mldr; it was an accident waiting to happen.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/washington-bridge-between-manhattan-and-bronx-gets-bus-and-protected-bike-lanes>Washington Bridge upgrades</a></p><p>But not every move protects the vulnerable. De La Rosa introduced a bill to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/12/opinion-weakening-injury-insurance-coverage-for-cabbies-will-harm-victims-of-road-violence>slash injury insurance for taxi and app drivers</a>, a change that would leave crash victims with less. As nurse and crash survivor Lauren Pine <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/12/opinion-weakening-injury-insurance-coverage-for-cabbies-will-harm-victims-of-road-violence>warned</a>, &ldquo;The minimum $50,000 no fault insurance was exhausted within the first week or so of my hospitalization.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Speed and inattention still kill.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to redesign streets and keep cars away from crosswalks. But every delay means another family shattered. <strong>Contact Council Member De La Rosa. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand full insurance for victims. Demand streets where children can cross without fear.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They want eligibility raised to cover families earning up to $60,000. The mayor’s budget keeps funding flat. Riders face higher fares and shrinking options. The fight is urgent.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2023, 29 New York City Council members, led by Carmen De La Rosa, sent a letter to City Hall demanding expanded funding for the Fair Fares program. The letter urges the Adams administration to raise eligibility to 200 percent of the federal poverty line, stating, "We have a moral responsibility to make this essential program available to hundreds of thousands of low-income working families who badly need the savings." The council’s demand comes as the mayor’s preliminary budget keeps Fair Fares funding at $75 million, well below pre-pandemic levels. The council estimates a $61.5 million increase would allow the program to reach far more than the current 280,000 people. De La Rosa and her co-signers argue the current threshold is too low, excluding many struggling families. The push for expansion lands as fare hikes loom and inflation squeezes the city’s poorest riders. The matter is now central to ongoing budget negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
