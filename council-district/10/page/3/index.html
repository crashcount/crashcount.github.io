Ten people have died on these streets since 2022. Forty-three more suffered serious injuries. In the last year alone, 660 neighbors were hurt in 1,196 crashes. No one is spared—children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians. The violence is relentless.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was killed on West 181st Street, his chest crushed, his life ended by a truck <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to city data</a>. Last fall, a 15-year-old on a moped died at St. Nicholas Avenue, thrown from his seat, crushed by an SUV. The street does not forgive. The numbers keep climbing.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>Each crash leaves a scar—a mother, a son, a friend. The pain is not abstract. It is a name, a body, a family left behind. &ldquo;Kirk was taken from me just as we were starting our new life together. He was the love of my life,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/27/us-news/drunk-teen-jimmy-connors-killed-groom-to-be-kirk-walker-in-wrong-way-crash-after-night-out-at-nyc-club-new-suit-alleges/>said Shauntea Weaver</a> after a wrong-way crash killed her fiancé the day before their wedding.</p><p>The violence is not fate. It is the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who design and police these streets.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has taken steps. She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines and protect those on foot and bike <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>according to council records</a>. But the bill sits in committee, waiting. The city moves slow.

But cameras alone are not enough. The dead cannot wait for another study, another delay.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The crisis is not over. The next victim is already walking. Call Council Member De La Rosa. Demand action. Demand safer speeds, daylighted intersections, and streets built for people, not cars.

Change comes for riders and walkers.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 20, 2025, that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has proposed turning 34th Street into a mostly car-free busway, modeled after the 14th Street busway. The plan comes with support from three local community boards. According to the article, 'bus speeds on 14th Street increased by at least 24 percent, and bus ridership grew by 30 percent' after similar changes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes' since the 14th Street redesign. The 34th Street proposal would divert most cars, add painted intersections for visibility, and focus on pedestrian safety. The move targets slow bus speeds—now just 3 mph—and aims to reduce systemic danger for bus riders and people on foot. No driver errors are cited, but the plan addresses longstanding risks from car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, not a council bill but a city action, drew sharp criticism from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who opposed removing a vehicle lane for pedestrians and cyclists. The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.' Still, the move restores space to those on foot and bike, challenging car dominance and federal resistance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She condemned the 4,000% spike in summonses, highlighting the grave risks these pose to immigrant delivery workers, who face potential deportation for minor traffic infractions. Brewer argued that unsafe riding stems from unrealistic delivery deadlines set by companies like Grubhub and Uber, not from inherent recklessness.

In just two weeks, police issued more than 900 summonses—far surpassing the 553 issued in all of 2024. The Department of Transportation (DOT), led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, was not informed. The matter drew sharp criticism from former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman, who questioned why cyclists face harsher penalties than drivers: 'A car that runs a red light doesn't get a criminal violation, so why would a bike?' Government watchdogs and advocates, including Ben Furnas and Jon Orcutt, condemned the lack of coordination and the disproportionate enforcement. Many tickets targeted delivery workers, a group largely made up of immigrants.

The project follows urgent requests in 2023 from Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch. The public process begins in June and may run into 2026. The redesign aims to end decades of danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.

The rally, held on May Day, highlighted the vulnerability of immigrant delivery workers, many of whom stayed home due to heightened deportation fears. De La Rosa declared, 'These workers are already being discriminated against and marginalized in our city. Let’s not make their lives harder by allowing a loophole in the law to take money out of their pockets.' The bills seek to close the 'Instacart loophole' and ensure equity for all delivery workers. The Council also passed a bill raising the cap on fees delivery apps can charge restaurants, which will result in Relay workers receiving the $21.44 minimum wage.

Streets empty. Delivery workers vanish, scared of deportation. Supporters shout for fair pay. Instacart loophole leaves many unprotected. City’s most vulnerable stay home. Their silence deepens danger. Systemic risks linger. Equity denied. Safety lost.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2025, Council Member Carmen De La Rosa and advocates rallied for Intro 1133 and Intro 1135, bills to expand minimum wage protections to all delivery workers, including those for Instacart. The rally, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw few delivery workers attend. The matter summary reads: 'Advocates for delivery workers rallied on May Day in support of two pro-delivery worker bills, but many workers stayed home due to fears of deportation.' De La Rosa called for closing the Instacart loophole and ending discrimination. The chilling effect of immigration enforcement left the most at-risk workers absent. Safety analysts warn: when vulnerable workers avoid advocacy, their ability to demand safer streets and fair conditions shrinks. Systemic risks and inequities for pedestrians and cyclists persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot aims to cut truck congestion, reduce double parking, and shift deliveries to low-emission modes. Delivery giants like Amazon and UPS will use the hubs.
