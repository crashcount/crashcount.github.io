On July 24, an SUV struck a person also crossing with the signal. In April, a motor scooter overturned and hit a child on Edgecombe.

That is a start. It clears sight lines. It protects people in the crosswalk. It needs passage, funding, and fast delivery on the ground.</p><p>What must change now</p><p>Bring the Canal Street urgency north. Harden the crossings where people were hit last month. Daylight the blind corners. Do not wait for another body to move a bolt. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>record</a> is clear: ten dead and forty-five gravely hurt in District 10 since 2022.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Tell her to pass and fund Int 1138-2024, and to push DOT to harden W 168th, W 181st, Broadway, and Edgecombe now. Ask for dates, designs, and deadlines. Do not hang up until you get them.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Activists and electeds ask DOT to add better barriers to Grand Street bike lane,' highlights how plastic bollards fail to stop drivers from blocking lanes, forcing cyclists into traffic. Restler, along with Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Julia Salazar, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, signed a letter urging Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriguez to act. The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected. Activists say, 'We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021.'

TransitCenter’s Tabitha Decker noted that most recommended reforms remain unimplemented. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Mayor Adams claim bold plans, but advocates see little concrete action.

The Department of Transportation postponed converting the south outer roadway to a pedestrian-only path until December 2023, citing ongoing upper deck repairs. The matter, titled 'City punts fix for ‘treacherous’ Queensboro Bridge bike and pedestrian path by another year,' leaves cyclists and pedestrians sharing a dangerously tight path for another year. Councilmembers Julie Won and Julie Menin urged DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to speed up the process, calling the delay a safety concern. Cycling advocate Laura Shepard criticized the city for prioritizing drivers' comfort over vulnerable road users. DOT insists repairs must finish first. The delay keeps walkers and cyclists at risk, forced to share space while cars keep most of the bridge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, which would create a dedicated pedestrian path on the bridge’s south outer roadway, is now postponed until the end of 2023 due to deck fabrication issues. Council Members Julie Menin and Julie Won, responding to the delay, stated, 'At least two more years of a shared pedestrian and bike path is not the best outcome for our constituents.' Both called for a meeting with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, who reaffirmed his commitment to the project but offered no clear reason for the holdup. Advocates and community members condemned the delay as a threat to non-car users, citing frequent crashes and near-misses on the narrow shared path. They criticized the city’s prioritization of nine car lanes over the safety of cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The initiative, not a council bill but a citywide policy, requires all drivers and cyclists to stop for pedestrians at unsignalized crosswalks. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, a former council member, claims the rule protects pedestrians: 'Pedestrians are the ones that we are so committed to protecting in this particular initiative.' Mayor Adams and NYPD Commissioner Sewell stressed enforcement: warnings will end, compliance will be enforced. Advocates like George Calderaro and Jon Orcutt warn of NYPD bias and a crackdown on cyclists. The plan includes engineering fixes at 1,000 intersections, raised crosswalks, more bike corrals, and a public awareness campaign. Advocacy groups back infrastructure but demand fair enforcement, not targeting cyclists.

He also voiced support for local control over speed limits and speed cameras, echoing the Crash Victims Rights & Safety Act. Rodriguez said, 'expanding Citi Bike to the underserved community is critical,' but offered few specifics, citing the need for internal review and consultation with the mayor. He acknowledged a 3 percent budget cut but maintained commitment to bike lane protection. Rodriguez's stance signals intent to improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians, but concrete plans remain unclear.

The advocacy group declared, "The DOT bike program you inherit today is no longer a global leader or effective innovator." They criticized the agency for chasing mileage targets over safety and for letting police, film crews, and city vehicles block bike lanes. Bike New York called for physically protected lanes, more concrete, and an end to painted lanes and community board vetoes. Director Jon Orcutt said, "Bike lanes that are merely paint are obsolete and mostly useless to New Yorkers on bicycles in today’s city." DOT spokesman Seth Stein said Rodriguez agrees that a world-class protected bike lane network is key to safer streets and will consider the recommendations. The push is clear: vulnerable cyclists need real protection, not empty promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Keith Powers supports the full plan and calls for immediate action on the bike lane, urging the Adams administration and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to move forward. Local business interests, led by the Fifth Avenue Association, oppose the project, citing pandemic recovery concerns. Transportation Alternatives’ Cory Epstein says, 'Busways and bike lanes are good for the economy, good for our climate, and good for our Vision Zero goals.'
