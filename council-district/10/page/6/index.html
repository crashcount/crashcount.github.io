De La Rosa criticized the Parks Department's 'lack of communication' and pushed for a safer alternative. Community Board 12 and former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz backed a temporary protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway, calling it 'far superior and much safer.'

The agency had intended to reroute cyclists and pedestrians onto Broadway, a congested, hazardous road. Council Member Carmen De La Rosa of District 10 intervened, calling the Broadway detour 'pretty crazy' due to heavy traffic and parkway exits. De La Rosa pushed for alternatives, including a temporary protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway, which had support from Community Board 12. The matter, titled 'Parks Dept. Halts Greenway Repair to Mull Creating Safe Detour for Cyclists,' highlights the city’s repeated failure to provide safe detours during greenway closures. Cyclist Allegra Legrande praised De La Rosa’s advocacy and demanded real-time updates and safe routes for vulnerable road users.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.
