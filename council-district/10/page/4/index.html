The fight is urgent.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2023, 29 New York City Council members, led by Carmen De La Rosa, sent a letter to City Hall demanding expanded funding for the Fair Fares program. The letter urges the Adams administration to raise eligibility to 200 percent of the federal poverty line, stating, "We have a moral responsibility to make this essential program available to hundreds of thousands of low-income working families who badly need the savings." The council’s demand comes as the mayor’s preliminary budget keeps Fair Fares funding at $75 million, well below pre-pandemic levels. The council estimates a $61.5 million increase would allow the program to reach far more than the current 280,000 people. De La Rosa and her co-signers argue the current threshold is too low, excluding many struggling families. The push for expansion lands as fare hikes loom and inflation squeezes the city’s poorest riders. The matter is now central to ongoing budget negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
