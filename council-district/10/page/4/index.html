In the last twelve months alone, 486 neighbors were hurt in 945 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last summer, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st Street. A truck, parked and unmoving, became the last thing he saw. The record shows: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> was the cause. The helmet did not save him. The street did not forgive him. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><p>A 15-year-old on a moped died at Saint Nicholas and 185th. A 21-year-old woman burned to death as a passenger on 10th Avenue. The list goes on. Each crash a wound that never heals.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against the softest bodies.</p><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>). But for the families who lost someone, the numbers are cold comfort.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let NYC set its own speed limits and give crash victims a bill of rights. She backed a ban on parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines for walkers. She voted yes on warning decals in taxis to protect cyclists from getting doored (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act and other legislation</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member De La Rosa. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets that put people before steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The blood is still fresh.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mopeds banned from bike lanes. Cyclists and pedestrians get relief. DOT will not lower speed limits. Mopeds must be registered. Advocates want safer roads. Public hearing set for April 14.</p><p class=mb3>On March 13, 2025, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a new policy permitting mopeds on the Brooklyn Bridge and the lower roadway of the Queensboro Bridge. The policy aims to move mopeds out of bike lanes and onto motor vehicle lanes, addressing hazardous mixing of modes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “This proposed rule change is about expanding safe, practical options for moped users.” The change responds to rising moped use, especially among delivery workers, and ongoing conflicts with cyclists and pedestrians. Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York support removing mopeds from bikeways but urge DOT to do more for moped safety. The DOT will not lower speed limits as part of the policy. Mopeds remain banned from the Queensboro’s upper roadway. A public hearing is scheduled for April 14. The city recorded 1,496 injury-causing moped crashes in 2024, with only one on an East River Bridge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would require all e-bikes to have license plates and be registered with the DMV or DOT. The rally, held near Governor Hochul’s office, drew support from the NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance. The matter title: 'New Yorkers rally in Midtown to combat “lawless” e-bike riding in NYC.' Holden supports both city and state versions, stating, 'We need the state DMV to issue license plates for e-bikes.' Rajkumar declared, 'We will usher in a new era free of e-bikes blasting through red lights.' The bill is named for Priscilla Loke, killed by an e-bike in 2023. Advocates say e-bike collisions often end in hit-and-runs. They demand rules and consequences to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, both vehicles were 'making right turn' when they crashed. The report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Turning Improperly' as contributing factors. The narrative describes the scene: 'Steel kissed steel. The Honda's side split. The BMW's nose crushed. Two young men, both 22, slumped inside, heads bleeding. Semiconscious. Silent. The speed still echoed in the wreckage.' The data shows both drivers were licensed and neither occupant was ejected. The focus remains on driver actions—unsafe speed and improper turning—as the root causes of this violent crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, covering 750 school zones, needs state approval before June. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls speed cameras 'one of the most effective tools' to stop deadly driving. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who sponsored the last reauthorization, says, 'my bill to expand the speed camera program has saved lives.' The city wants stronger penalties for repeat offenders and action on license plate fraud, which lets millions of violations go unpunished. The report shows cameras cut speeding by 94 percent and reduce injuries and deaths. The program faces political hurdles, but the evidence is clear: speed cameras protect people on foot and bike. Lawmakers must decide whether to keep this life-saving tool.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Granite blocks, bike racks, and barriers will guard corners. Most pedestrian deaths happen at intersections. The city has ignored its own parking ban. Activists demand real change. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On January 17, 2025, Mayor Eric Adams proposed a budget boost to $3.85 million per year for 'hardened daylighting' at intersections. The plan, detailed by City Hall's Office of Management and Budget, aims to install granite blocks, bike racks, and other barriers at hundreds of corners. Adams said, 'We are ... keeping New Yorkers safe on our streets ... by improving road safety at hundreds of targeted traffic intersections.' State law bans parking within 20 feet of intersections, but New York City exempts itself, fueling deadly crashes—55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries happen at intersections. Council members and grassroots activists are pushing to end the city's carveout and require the Department of Transportation to add barriers to 1,000 intersections a year. Jackson Chabot of Open Plans said, 'Hardening is what makes daylighting actually work, so the budget item is really crucial to expanding it across the city.' The push follows the 2023 death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a poorly designed corner. The fight for safer streets is far from over.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the driver was not wearing a seatbelt and suffered head injuries and crush injuries, though he remained conscious at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The parked truck was unoccupied at the time. The impact crumpled metal and left the sedan’s front end destroyed. No other injuries were reported.

Streets stay dangerous. Promises broken.</p><p class=mb3>On December 27, 2024, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (District 28) condemned the Adams administration for failing to meet the 2019 Streets Plan’s legal requirements. The Department of Transportation installed only about five miles of protected bus lanes and 22 miles of protected bike lanes—far below the mandated 30 and 50 miles. The matter, titled 'Worst Mayor Ever for Bus Riders? Adams's Streets Plan Failure Means Longer Commutes for the Poorest New Yorkers,' highlights how DOT’s underperformance has slowed bus speeds and left vulnerable road users exposed. Speaker Adams, through spokesperson Mara Davis, called the Streets Plan benchmarks 'critical for street safety' and criticized DOT for 'consistently fall[ing] short of complying with the law.' Pending legislation seeks more transparency. The city’s neglect leaves riders and cyclists in danger, with no relief in sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
