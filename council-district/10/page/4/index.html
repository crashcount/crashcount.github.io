The driver struck a 29-year-old woman on her bike, then ran. The officers checked her, then left. The car sat empty. The street stayed the same. Neighbors watched. One said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 10 saw <strong>1,204 crashes</strong>. <strong>Sixteen people were seriously hurt</strong>. <strong>665 were injured</strong>. No one died this year—luck, not policy. Last year, two people died. The year before, more. The numbers do not rest.</p><h3 id=the-toll-on-the-vulnerable>The Toll on the Vulnerable</h3><p>The wounded are young and old. Forty children under 18 were hurt this year. Cyclists and walkers take the worst of it. The intersection at Cabrini is a funnel for bike traffic from the bridge. It is a trap. A man named Jordan said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem.&rdquo;</a></p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. <strong>388 injuries and deaths</strong> came from cars and SUVs. <strong>22</strong> from motorcycles and mopeds. <strong>13</strong> from bikes. The street is not safe for anyone without steel around them.</p><h3 id=council-member-de-la-rosa-action-and-delay>Council Member De La Rosa: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has signed on to a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, forcing the city to clear sightlines at 1,000 intersections a year. The <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill sits in committee</a>. The city moves slow. The cars do not. There is no record of De La Rosa leading on speed limits, protected bike lanes, or the worst repeat offenders. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another crash.</strong> Call Council Member De La Rosa. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead.</p><p><strong>The street remembers. So should we.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash happened around 10:10 a.m. on Broome Street near Centre Street. The van driver told the outlet, "I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident." The collision forced the cyclist into the path of a red delivery truck, which then struck him. The 54-year-old truck driver stayed at the scene. Police had not determined if charges would be filed.

The official matter summary states: 'The DOT unveiled three new microhubs to promote cleaner, greener, last-mile deliveries.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, applauded the initiative, saying, 'It is incredibly important to have these hubs where we can pull the trucks off the streets and get the delivery via bicycle.' The pilot aims to cut truck congestion, reduce double parking, and shift deliveries to low-emission modes. Delivery giants like Amazon and UPS will use the hubs.

Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On April 11, 2025, the City Council passed Intro 1105 and Intro 1114. Both bills require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create public trackers for capital projects tied to the Streets Master Plan. Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous.

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws.

The plan, not yet introduced as a formal bill, would cost $20 million, according to the Department of Transportation. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from e-bike users, advocates, and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The matter centers on Cuomo's claim that registration will address 'chaos and promote safety.' Critics, including Queens cycling advocate Jim Burke and safe streets organizer Noel Hidalgo, argue the measure 'demonizes' e-bike users and ignores the real danger: reckless driving by motorists. Advocates say the plan would harm families, seniors, and delivery workers who rely on e-bikes, especially in transit deserts. They urge lawmakers to focus on street design and car enforcement, not new restrictions.

In effect it’s not a bike lane quite honestly; no one uses it, they [drivers] park there. We would like to see the hard infrastructure removed." Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that building safe bike lanes requires support from local leaders.

The letter states: 'With sufficient staffing and funding, DOT could help New York City improve street safety, reduce car dependency, meet our climate goals, and bring reliable transit service to more neighborhoods.' Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives testified at a council hearing, warning, 'An underfunded DOT doesn’t just mean more dangerous streets—it also means a less liveable, vibrant, and thriving city.' Brooks-Powers and advocates argue that without more staff and money, life-saving projects like Open Streets will not expand.

The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
