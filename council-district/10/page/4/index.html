But they do not lie. <strong>Ten people killed. Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In three years, 3,688 crashes tore through these streets. <strong>One cyclist dead on West 181st, struck by a truck while riding at night. A 15-year-old thrown from a moped on Saint Nicholas Avenue, never to come home.</strong></p><p>The wounds are not just numbers. A mother waits for a son who will never walk through the door. A cyclist’s helmet lies cracked on the curb. <strong>SUVs and cars led the body count, with two pedestrian deaths and over a hundred serious injuries.</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Carmen De La Rosa has backed some measures that matter. She co-sponsored the push for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Sammy’s Law</a>, giving the city power to lower speed limits. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She fought for <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/washington-bridge-between-manhattan-and-bronx-gets-bus-and-protected-bike-lanes>protected bike lanes on the Washington Bridge</a>, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been so afraid to walk a bridge on foot&mldr; it was an accident waiting to happen.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/washington-bridge-between-manhattan-and-bronx-gets-bus-and-protected-bike-lanes>Washington Bridge upgrades</a></p><p>But not every move protects the vulnerable. De La Rosa introduced a bill to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/12/opinion-weakening-injury-insurance-coverage-for-cabbies-will-harm-victims-of-road-violence>slash injury insurance for taxi and app drivers</a>, a change that would leave crash victims with less. As nurse and crash survivor Lauren Pine <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/12/opinion-weakening-injury-insurance-coverage-for-cabbies-will-harm-victims-of-road-violence>warned</a>, &ldquo;The minimum $50,000 no fault insurance was exhausted within the first week or so of my hospitalization.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Speed and inattention still kill.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to redesign streets and keep cars away from crosswalks. But every delay means another family shattered. <strong>Contact Council Member De La Rosa. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand full insurance for victims. Demand streets where children can cross without fear.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Carmen De La Rosa of District 10 intervened, calling the Broadway detour 'pretty crazy' due to heavy traffic and parkway exits. De La Rosa pushed for alternatives, including a temporary protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway, which had support from Community Board 12. The matter, titled 'Parks Dept. Halts Greenway Repair to Mull Creating Safe Detour for Cyclists,' highlights the city’s repeated failure to provide safe detours during greenway closures. Cyclist Allegra Legrande praised De La Rosa’s advocacy and demanded real-time updates and safe routes for vulnerable road users.

The bill’s matter title reads: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle.” Council Member Althea V. Stevens led as primary sponsor, joined by 26 co-sponsors including Hudson, Williams, Restler, Krishnan, and others. The bill would have added 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a reporting category. It was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. This measure aimed to expose police vehicle violence by demanding full transparency in use-of-force reporting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
