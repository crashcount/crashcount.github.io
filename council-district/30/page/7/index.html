Six are dead; corners wide as runways. Defaced plates don’t stop steel. Demand concrete now: protected bike lanes, daylighted crossings, slower turns, junkers gone. Crashes are up about 12%. Don’t let City Hall stall.</p><p>What broke this summer
On Aug. 3, an SUV made a U-turn and hit a moped on Fresh Pond Road.</p><p>On June 13, a 70-year-old man was killed by a bus at Woodhaven Boulevard and Hoffman Drive. On March 19, a 23-year-old cyclist was killed at 63rd Drive and Queens Boulevard. On April 19, another cyclist died at Juniper Boulevard North and 80th Street. Last fall, a motorcyclist died at Eliot Avenue and 69th Street.</p><p>These are the places. These are the dead. The road goes on.</p><p>The count, not the spin
In District 30, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crashes are up about 12%</a> this year compared with last year to date, and deaths doubled from 3 to 6. Across the period since 2022, the district <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>logged</a> 4,116 crashes, 2,302 injuries, and 35 serious injuries.</p><p>The headlines elsewhere in Queens echo the same story. Near JFK last Wednesday, “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made.</a>” Police said, “<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man.</a>”</p><p>What Holden has done — and hasn’t
Council Member Robert F. Holden <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>backed</a> a bill to strip city parking permits for obscured or defaced plates (Int 1358-2025, in committee). He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored</a> a measure to verify plates and VINs and require NYPD parking data (Int 1252-2025, in committee). He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted yes</a> to speed removal of derelict vehicles (Int 0857-2024, passed).</p><p>Holden also supported <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/new-protected-bike-lanes-will-connect-to-ridgewood-reservoir>protected bike lanes</a> and new sidewalks on Cypress Avenue to the Ridgewood Reservoir. These steps help. But the deaths keep coming. Enforcement on plates won’t slow a turning truck at a wide corner. Reports won’t harden a crossing.</p><p>What must change now
Build and protect the lanes. Daylight the corners. Tame the speeds. Clear the junked cars fast. Then do it again, block by block.</p><p>Call to action
District 30 cannot wait. Call Council Member Holden. Demand concrete that saves lives: protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and real enforcement on plate tampering. Tell him the numbers are up and the names are piling. Do not accept delay.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
