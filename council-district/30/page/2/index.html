These are the district’s top hot spots in the city’s ledger (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Peak harm hits the afternoon push. From 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., injuries stack up and deaths spike, with the 4 p.m. hour alone tied to four deaths over the period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The leading listed factors are a junk drawer called “other,” followed by vulnerable road user error. Failure to yield, distraction, and unsafe speed appear too, but the counts hide inside the larger pile (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=names-reduced-to-rows>Names reduced to rows</h3><p>A 23‑year‑old on a bike died at Queens Blvd and 63rd Dr on March 19, 2025. The record shows “going straight.” He was pronounced dead (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4799953</a>).</p><p>On April 19, 2025, at Juniper Blvd North and 80th St, a 54‑year‑old cyclist was killed by a right‑turning box truck. The truck’s bumper is noted. The bike was “demolished” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4807280</a>).</p><p>June 13, 2025, Woodhaven Blvd and Hoffman Dr: a 70‑year‑old pedestrian was killed by a bus.

Occupants account for the largest injury load, but outside the vehicle is where fragile bodies meet heavy machines (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district rollup</a>).</p><p>Trucks and buses are overrepresented in fatal pedestrian harm here: 5 pedestrian deaths tied to trucks/buses against 22 total heavy‑vehicle pedestrian crashes in the rollup (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district rollup</a>).</p><p>Wrong‑way violence sits nearby in Queens. On the Clearview Expressway, a driver admitted he entered the highway “in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people.” A jury convicted him; the judge gave eight years. The DA said he “terrorized other drivers” and left two “badly hurt” (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>). The city feels that kind of impact long after the sirens fade.</p><h3 id=local-levers-we-have-not-pulled-hard-enough>Local levers we have not pulled hard enough</h3><ul><li>Harden turns and add daylighting at Grand Ave, Woodhaven Blvd, and Fresh Pond Rd. Protect the corners where trucks sweep wide. Give people on foot and on bikes a head start with LPIs. These tools match the crash types logged: turning trucks, crossing pedestrians, bikes “going straight” hit by turning vehicles (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Build physical protection where the city already showed its hand. DOT is installing a protected path on Cypress Ave to the Ridgewood Reservoir. Even cycling skeptics backed it for safety. Advocates cited 166 crashes and 99 injuries in three years. Extend that logic to our hot spots now (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/new-protected-bike-lanes-will-connect-to-ridgewood-reservoir>Streetsblog</a>).</li><li>Crack down on ghost plates and permit abuse. Council Member Robert F. Holden backed a bill to yank city parking permits for obscured plates and misuse. Masked plates block the cameras that catch speed and red‑light offenses (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file Int 1358‑2025</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-brakes-we-still-need>Citywide brakes we still need</h3><ul><li><strong>Lower the default speed limit.</strong> Albany passed the authority. The city can set safer speeds. The power exists in law; the question is will. Use it to slow the baseline on every block (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</li><li><strong>Stop the repeat speeders.</strong> Lawmakers pushed a bill to force habitual violators to install intelligent speed assistance after strings of camera tickets or points. Survivors and officials said these devices cut the deadly excess. The demand is on the record after killings tied to repeat offenders (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/25/greenpoint-woman-dies-from-injuries-sustained-in-crash>Streetsblog</a>).</li></ul><p>Lives end in the margins of the spreadsheets. A right turn. A missed head start. A plate you can’t read.</p><p>One thing you can do today: help force the city to use the tools it has. <strong>Ask leaders to set safer speeds and rein in repeat speeders</strong>.
