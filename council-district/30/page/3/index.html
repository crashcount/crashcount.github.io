He died on the street, his ride cut short. The NYPD is still investigating. No arrests. No relief. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>The cyclist was pronounced dead at the scene.</a></p><p>A motorcyclist, 55, struck by a BMW on Woodhaven Boulevard. The bike burst into flames. He died there. The driver had a record of speeding and reckless driving. Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>alleged</a>, &ldquo;As alleged, this defendant plowed his BMW SUV into a motorcyclist shortly after the two had a minor collision on the Long Island Expressway.

In District 30, trucks killed four. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two. Cars and SUVs left dozens more with broken bodies. The violence is relentless. The pain is local.</p><h3 id=what-has-holden-done>What Has Holden Done?</h3><p>Council Member Robert F. Holden has stood on both sides of the line. He co-sponsored bills for safer crossings and tougher penalties for blocked plates. He backed new greenways and supported protected bike lanes on Cypress Avenue, a rare move for him. But he also voted <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>against ending jaywalking enforcement</a>, a law that targeted the vulnerable and did nothing to stop drivers from killing. He pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/11/dot-council-e-bike-registration-bill-is-not-necessary-to-make-streets-safer>e-bike registration</a>, a move the city’s own DOT chief called wasteful and harmful: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/11/dot-council-e-bike-registration-bill-is-not-necessary-to-make-streets-safer>&ldquo;The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal cycling behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Holden cheered the federal rollback of congestion pricing, a policy proven to cut traffic and save lives. He called it &ldquo;unfair and burdensome for working families.&rdquo; The cost is measured in blood, not tolls.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The bodies keep coming. The laws move slow.</strong> Call Council Member Holden. Demand real change: lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and an end to policies that punish the vulnerable. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure, discussed in the article 'NYC residents slapped with congestion pricing ‘surcharge’ by fed-up companies paying new toll: ‘Hochul inflation’,' has sparked backlash. Queens Councilman Robert F. Holden, representing District 30, condemned the move, stating, 'It’s no surprise that businesses will pass the Congestion Scam Tax on to consumers.' Companies like CompuVoip and Dream Events & Decor now add surcharges for customers in the zone. Holden’s criticism joins that of Bronx Councilwoman Kristy Marmorato and others, who warn of higher costs and increased gridlock. Emergency unions claim response times will suffer. The bill’s impact on vulnerable road users was not assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, debated on December 12, 2024, sits before the City Council. It would require all e-mobility devices not covered by the state DMV to register with the city’s Department of Transportation. The bill’s summary states it aims to increase accountability for e-bike riders after fatal crashes. Holden, the sponsor, cited dangers from unregulated e-vehicles and hit-and-runs. Advocacy groups, including Los Deliveristas Unidos and Open Plans, argue the bill would unfairly criminalize immigrants and delivery workers, and increase police stops for people of color. The NYC Hospitality Alliance warns of new financial and administrative burdens for small businesses. Both sides agree cars cause far more deaths, but the bill’s critics say better street design, not registration, would protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is named after Priscilla Loke, killed by an electric Citi Bike rider. Legal experts Daniel Flanzig, Peter Beadle, and Brandon Chamberlin argue the bill violates state law, which bars cities from imposing fees that restrict the 'free use' of bicycles. They warn it would create barriers to e-bike use and could lead to inconsistent rules across cities. Holden defends the bill as a push for 'accountability and safety.' Critics say it discourages e-bike use and risks police harassment, especially for immigrants. The city Law Department declined comment. The bill’s legal standing and impact on vulnerable road users remain sharply contested.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the vehicle hit him head-on, crushing his back and leaving him conscious on the pavement. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing without a signal, but this is noted only after the primary driver errors. The vehicle's point of impact and damage were both at the center front end, underscoring the directness of the collision.

The plan, presented to Queens Community Board 5 in June, calls for a two-way cycle path protected by jersey barriers and sidewalk expansions between Cooper Avenue and Cypress Hills Street. The matter summary states: 'Protected bike lanes and built-out sidewalks are coming to Cypress Avenue to provide a safe connection to Highland Park.' Council Member Bob Holden, usually a cycling skeptic, supports the project. His spokesperson said, 'This particular lane benefits those biking to and from the Ridgewood Reservoir and addresses a broader quality of life issue along Cypress Avenue.' Advocates like Bree Mobley of Ridgewood Riders back the plan, citing the area's crash history—166 crashes, 99 injuries in three years.
