He died on the street, his ride cut short. The NYPD is still investigating. No arrests. No relief. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>The cyclist was pronounced dead at the scene.</a></p><p>A motorcyclist, 55, struck by a BMW on Woodhaven Boulevard. The bike burst into flames. He died there. The driver had a record of speeding and reckless driving. Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>alleged</a>, &ldquo;As alleged, this defendant plowed his BMW SUV into a motorcyclist shortly after the two had a minor collision on the Long Island Expressway.

The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A cyclist, a motorcyclist, a pedestrian. In District 30, trucks killed four. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two. Cars and SUVs left dozens more with broken bodies. The violence is relentless. The pain is local.</p><h3 id=what-has-holden-done>What Has Holden Done?</h3><p>Council Member Robert F. Holden has stood on both sides of the line. He co-sponsored bills for safer crossings and tougher penalties for blocked plates. He backed new greenways and supported protected bike lanes on Cypress Avenue, a rare move for him. But he also voted <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>against ending jaywalking enforcement</a>, a law that targeted the vulnerable and did nothing to stop drivers from killing. He pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/11/dot-council-e-bike-registration-bill-is-not-necessary-to-make-streets-safer>e-bike registration</a>, a move the city’s own DOT chief called wasteful and harmful: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/11/dot-council-e-bike-registration-bill-is-not-necessary-to-make-streets-safer>&ldquo;The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal cycling behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Holden cheered the federal rollback of congestion pricing, a policy proven to cut traffic and save lives. He called it &ldquo;unfair and burdensome for working families.&rdquo; The cost is measured in blood, not tolls.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The bodies keep coming. The laws move slow.</strong> Call Council Member Holden. Demand real change: lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and an end to policies that punish the vulnerable. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.

The plan, presented to Queens Community Board 5 in June, calls for a two-way cycle path protected by jersey barriers and sidewalk expansions between Cooper Avenue and Cypress Hills Street. The matter summary states: 'Protected bike lanes and built-out sidewalks are coming to Cypress Avenue to provide a safe connection to Highland Park.' Council Member Bob Holden, usually a cycling skeptic, supports the project. His spokesperson said, 'This particular lane benefits those biking to and from the Ridgewood Reservoir and addresses a broader quality of life issue along Cypress Avenue.' Advocates like Bree Mobley of Ridgewood Riders back the plan, citing the area's crash history—166 crashes, 99 injuries in three years.

Brannan (primary sponsor, District 47) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) lead the push. The bill targets drivers who cover or deface plates to evade speed, red-light, and bus-lane cameras. Data shows unreadable plates rose from 3.98% to 4.66% in one year. The city lost up to $38.7 million in unissued tickets between 2019 and 2022. The resolution calls for higher fines, confiscation of plate coverings, and registration suspensions.

Bill slaps fines and jail time on drivers who cover or deface tags. No more hiding from cameras. Law aims to strip shields from reckless motorists. Committee weighs next steps. Streets demand accountability.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0766-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced April 11, 2024, the bill bans parking, standing, stopping, or operating a vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the parking, standing, stopping, or operation of a motor vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates.' Council Member Oswald Feliz leads as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Bottcher, Gennaro, Marte, Restler, Ung, and Paladino. The bill hits violators with up to $1,000 fines, possible jail, and escalating penalties for repeat offenses. The measure aims to end the dodge—drivers hiding plates to evade enforcement. The committee now holds the bill for review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, underscoring the moped driver's dangerous actions.
