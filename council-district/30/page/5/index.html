He died on the street, his ride cut short. The NYPD is still investigating. No arrests. No relief. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>The cyclist was pronounced dead at the scene.</a></p><p>A motorcyclist, 55, struck by a BMW on Woodhaven Boulevard. The bike burst into flames. He died there. The driver had a record of speeding and reckless driving. Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>alleged</a>, &ldquo;As alleged, this defendant plowed his BMW SUV into a motorcyclist shortly after the two had a minor collision on the Long Island Expressway. As a result&mldr; the motorcycle burst into flames and the driver was killed.&rdquo;</p><p>In the last twelve months, District 30 saw <strong>6 deaths</strong> and <strong>623 injuries</strong> from traffic crashes. <strong>Six people suffered serious injuries.</strong> The streets are not safe. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A cyclist, a motorcyclist, a pedestrian. In District 30, trucks killed four. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two. Cars and SUVs left dozens more with broken bodies. The violence is relentless. The pain is local.</p><h3 id=what-has-holden-done>What Has Holden Done?</h3><p>Council Member Robert F. Holden has stood on both sides of the line. He co-sponsored bills for safer crossings and tougher penalties for blocked plates. He backed new greenways and supported protected bike lanes on Cypress Avenue, a rare move for him. But he also voted <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>against ending jaywalking enforcement</a>, a law that targeted the vulnerable and did nothing to stop drivers from killing. He pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/11/dot-council-e-bike-registration-bill-is-not-necessary-to-make-streets-safer>e-bike registration</a>, a move the city’s own DOT chief called wasteful and harmful: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/11/dot-council-e-bike-registration-bill-is-not-necessary-to-make-streets-safer>&ldquo;The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal cycling behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Holden cheered the federal rollback of congestion pricing, a policy proven to cut traffic and save lives. He called it &ldquo;unfair and burdensome for working families.&rdquo; The cost is measured in blood, not tolls.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The bodies keep coming. The laws move slow.</strong> Call Council Member Holden. Demand real change: lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and an end to policies that punish the vulnerable.

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash left one worker dead and another person injured, underscoring the lethal consequences of driver error.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The editorial, titled 'Hey, Donovan Richards: It’s actually way more racist to FAVOR congestion pricing,' criticized Queens Borough President Donovan Richards for labeling Holden’s opposition as racist. The piece argued, 'congestion pricing would be a disaster,' claiming it would harm diverse outer-borough residents and worsen air quality in The Bronx by diverting diesel trucks. The editorial cited MTA studies predicting only a 3.1% reduction in Manhattan traffic and framed the plan as an unfair tax on commerce. Holden’s stance reflects ongoing resistance to congestion pricing in the council, with equity and environmental impacts at the center of the debate. No formal council vote or bill was referenced in this editorial.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30) condemned the longstanding exemption shielding Governor Hochul’s state-owned SUVs from traffic camera enforcement. The matter, reported as 'Gov. Hochul’s SUVs are cloaked from traffic cameras,' reveals that these vehicles, used by Hochul and Lt. Governor Delgado, cannot be flagged by speed or red-light cameras—a security measure in place for fifty years. Holden called the exemption 'disgusting and disturbing,' highlighting the hypocrisy as Hochul champions camera expansion and congestion pricing for the public. The city’s Department of Transportation and other officials were unaware of the loophole. In contrast, Mayor Adams’ NYPD detail faces camera enforcement. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure and other critics demand accountability for all officials. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the lack of enforcement leaves vulnerable road users at risk while officials evade consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'Both drivers ran the light.' The motorcyclist, not wearing a helmet, was ejected and suffered fatal head injuries. He died at the scene. The SUV carried three occupants, including a 1-year-old and a 49-year-old passenger, who were not seriously hurt.

Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The matter, reported by the New York Post, highlights Levine’s history of 41 traffic violations, including speeding and blocking bike lanes. Holden said, “He’s the last person who should be advocating for more bike lanes, having been caught blocking one.” Despite the criticism, Levine continues to promote street redesigns and enforcement, aiming to convert a section of the West Side Highway into a bike lane and favor non-car owners in community board appointments. Levine’s spokesman stated that all tickets were paid promptly and steps have been taken to prevent future infractions. Street-safety groups back Levine’s agenda, which centers on protecting vulnerable road users by reducing car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden said, 'It’s not only illegal, but very dangerous. There’s nothing compassionate about letting people do this. Both the panhandlers and motorists are in danger.' The NYPD acknowledged the issue but stated their goal is voluntary compliance and connecting individuals to services, not arrests.
