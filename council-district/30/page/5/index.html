No loopholes.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0161-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 28, 2024, by Council Members Louis (primary), Carr, Ung, Holden, Ariola, Paladino, and Morano. The bill orders DOT to assess at least 100 speed camera locations each year for raised speed reducer feasibility. If feasible, DOT must install the bump within a year. The law demands annual reports on these checks and on shifts in dangerous driving at treated sites. The bill summary reads: 'requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' Council aims to force physical changes where cameras alone fail.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
