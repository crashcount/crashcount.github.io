These are the district’s top hot spots in the city’s ledger (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Peak harm hits the afternoon push. From 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., injuries stack up and deaths spike, with the 4 p.m. hour alone tied to four deaths over the period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The leading listed factors are a junk drawer called “other,” followed by vulnerable road user error. Failure to yield, distraction, and unsafe speed appear too, but the counts hide inside the larger pile (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=names-reduced-to-rows>Names reduced to rows</h3><p>A 23‑year‑old on a bike died at Queens Blvd and 63rd Dr on March 19, 2025. The record shows “going straight.” He was pronounced dead (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4799953</a>).</p><p>On April 19, 2025, at Juniper Blvd North and 80th St, a 54‑year‑old cyclist was killed by a right‑turning box truck. The truck’s bumper is noted. The bike was “demolished” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4807280</a>).</p><p>June 13, 2025, Woodhaven Blvd and Hoffman Dr: a 70‑year‑old pedestrian was killed by a bus. The record lists “crush injuries” and “apparent death” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4820244</a>).</p><p>Nov. 1, 2024, Eliot Ave at 69th St: a motorcyclist died after a Kia turned left. The rider was ejected. The bike’s front end is all that’s left in the box (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4768223</a>).</p><h3 id=the-repeat-pattern-steel-over-flesh>The repeat pattern: steel over flesh</h3><p>District tallies since 2022: pedestrians, 7 dead and 393 injured; cyclists, 4 dead and 238 injured. Occupants account for the largest injury load, but outside the vehicle is where fragile bodies meet heavy machines (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district rollup</a>).</p><p>Trucks and buses are overrepresented in fatal pedestrian harm here: 5 pedestrian deaths tied to trucks/buses against 22 total heavy‑vehicle pedestrian crashes in the rollup (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district rollup</a>).</p><p>Wrong‑way violence sits nearby in Queens. On the Clearview Expressway, a driver admitted he entered the highway “in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people.” A jury convicted him; the judge gave eight years. The DA said he “terrorized other drivers” and left two “badly hurt” (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>). The city feels that kind of impact long after the sirens fade.</p><h3 id=local-levers-we-have-not-pulled-hard-enough>Local levers we have not pulled hard enough</h3><ul><li>Harden turns and add daylighting at Grand Ave, Woodhaven Blvd, and Fresh Pond Rd. Protect the corners where trucks sweep wide. Give people on foot and on bikes a head start with LPIs. These tools match the crash types logged: turning trucks, crossing pedestrians, bikes “going straight” hit by turning vehicles (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Build physical protection where the city already showed its hand. DOT is installing a protected path on Cypress Ave to the Ridgewood Reservoir. Even cycling skeptics backed it for safety. Advocates cited 166 crashes and 99 injuries in three years. Extend that logic to our hot spots now (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/new-protected-bike-lanes-will-connect-to-ridgewood-reservoir>Streetsblog</a>).</li><li>Crack down on ghost plates and permit abuse. Council Member Robert F. Holden backed a bill to yank city parking permits for obscured plates and misuse. Masked plates block the cameras that catch speed and red‑light offenses (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file Int 1358‑2025</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-brakes-we-still-need>Citywide brakes we still need</h3><ul><li><strong>Lower the default speed limit.</strong> Albany passed the authority. The city can set safer speeds. The power exists in law; the question is will. Use it to slow the baseline on every block (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</li><li><strong>Stop the repeat speeders.</strong> Lawmakers pushed a bill to force habitual violators to install intelligent speed assistance after strings of camera tickets or points. Survivors and officials said these devices cut the deadly excess. The demand is on the record after killings tied to repeat offenders (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/25/greenpoint-woman-dies-from-injuries-sustained-in-crash>Streetsblog</a>).</li></ul><p>Lives end in the margins of the spreadsheets. A right turn. A missed head start. A plate you can’t read.</p><p>One thing you can do today: help force the city to use the tools it has. <strong>Ask leaders to set safer speeds and rein in repeat speeders</strong>. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact threw him to the ground. He lost his leg. The truck kept moving. The cyclist was left unconscious, bleeding, and alone.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a flatbed truck traveling north on Maspeth Avenue near Rust Street struck a 27-year-old male cyclist from behind at 9:05 a.m. The narrative states, 'A flatbed truck struck a 27-year-old cyclist from behind. He flew, hit the ground, lost his leg. No helmet. Unconscious. The truck kept moving. No damage.' The cyclist was ejected from his bike and suffered an amputation to his lower leg, leaving him unconscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor, but the primary event remains the truck striking the cyclist from behind. The truck driver continued on without stopping, and the vehicle sustained no reported damage. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s actions. The crash highlights the lethal consequences vulnerable road users face when struck by large vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The driver, Stanley Manel, had 26 speed camera tickets. He faced minor charges. Officials demand action: lower speed limits, force repeat offenders to install speed controls, and redesign deadly streets. The city’s inaction kills.</p><p class=mb3>"Assembly Member Gallagher carries legislation requiring drivers with six or more speeding tickets in a year – or with 11 or more points on their license in 18 months – to install an intelligent speed assistance device in their car that prevents speeding." -- Dennis P. Gallagher</p><p class=mb3>On February 25, 2024, after Danielle Aber was killed by a repeat speeding driver in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, a coalition of elected officials demanded sweeping changes. The group—Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez—called for passage of two state bills: one mandating intelligent speed assistance devices for drivers with six or more speeding tickets in a year, and 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let the City Council lower speed limits. Their statement read, 'We’re calling on the New York State legislature to pass two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence.' They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections, and to convert Nassau and Norman avenues to one-way streets. The officials’ push highlights the deadly gap in accountability and infrastructure that leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
