Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>alleged</a>, &ldquo;As alleged, this defendant plowed his BMW SUV into a motorcyclist shortly after the two had a minor collision on the Long Island Expressway. As a result&mldr; the motorcycle burst into flames and the driver was killed.&rdquo;</p><p>In the last twelve months, District 30 saw <strong>6 deaths</strong> and <strong>623 injuries</strong> from traffic crashes. <strong>Six people suffered serious injuries.</strong> The streets are not safe. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A cyclist, a motorcyclist, a pedestrian. In District 30, trucks killed four. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two. Cars and SUVs left dozens more with broken bodies. The violence is relentless. The pain is local.</p><h3 id=what-has-holden-done>What Has Holden Done?</h3><p>Council Member Robert F. Holden has stood on both sides of the line. He co-sponsored bills for safer crossings and tougher penalties for blocked plates. He backed new greenways and supported protected bike lanes on Cypress Avenue, a rare move for him. But he also voted <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>against ending jaywalking enforcement</a>, a law that targeted the vulnerable and did nothing to stop drivers from killing. He pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/11/dot-council-e-bike-registration-bill-is-not-necessary-to-make-streets-safer>e-bike registration</a>, a move the city’s own DOT chief called wasteful and harmful: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/11/dot-council-e-bike-registration-bill-is-not-necessary-to-make-streets-safer>&ldquo;The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal cycling behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Holden cheered the federal rollback of congestion pricing, a policy proven to cut traffic and save lives. He called it &ldquo;unfair and burdensome for working families.&rdquo; The cost is measured in blood, not tolls.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The bodies keep coming. The laws move slow.</strong> Call Council Member Holden. Demand real change: lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and an end to policies that punish the vulnerable. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, she was in a marked crosswalk when a northbound moped struck her head-on. The report states the rider was 'distracted' and lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The impact broke her hip and caused fatal injuries. The narrative notes the rider did not stop. No driver errors other than inattention are cited. The pedestrian was crossing at the intersection; the report does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor.

Critics say it targets delivery workers, mostly immigrants and people of color. The bill would hand police more power to stop, fine, and harass riders. The city’s most vulnerable would pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On December 20, 2023, Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30) published an op-ed opposing his own bill to require registration and licensing for e-bikes and e-scooters. The bill, introduced in the New York City Council, would impact the city’s 65,000 app-based delivery workers. The op-ed warns: 'What might sound benign at first would actually lead to a substantial increase in state surveillance and regulation of New York City's 65,000 app-based delivery workers.' Holden’s action—introducing the bill—has drawn sharp criticism for enabling more NYPD stops and fines, especially against Black, Latine, and immigrant riders. The piece details how similar enforcement has led to racial profiling and financial hardship for those least able to bear it. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the op-ed makes clear: more policing means more danger for the city’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
