Six are dead; corners wide as runways. Defaced plates don’t stop steel. Demand concrete now: protected bike lanes, daylighted crossings, slower turns, junkers gone. Crashes are up about 12%. Don’t let City Hall stall.</p><p>What broke this summer
On Aug. 3, an SUV made a U-turn and hit a moped on Fresh Pond Road.</p><p>On June 13, a 70-year-old man was killed by a bus at Woodhaven Boulevard and Hoffman Drive. On March 19, a 23-year-old cyclist was killed at 63rd Drive and Queens Boulevard. On April 19, another cyclist died at Juniper Boulevard North and 80th Street. Last fall, a motorcyclist died at Eliot Avenue and 69th Street.</p><p>These are the places. These are the dead. The road goes on.</p><p>The count, not the spin
In District 30, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crashes are up about 12%</a> this year compared with last year to date, and deaths doubled from 3 to 6. Across the period since 2022, the district <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>logged</a> 4,116 crashes, 2,302 injuries, and 35 serious injuries.</p><p>The headlines elsewhere in Queens echo the same story. Near JFK last Wednesday, “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made.</a>” Police said, “<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man.</a>”</p><p>What Holden has done — and hasn’t
Council Member Robert F. Holden <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>backed</a> a bill to strip city parking permits for obscured or defaced plates (Int 1358-2025, in committee). He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored</a> a measure to verify plates and VINs and require NYPD parking data (Int 1252-2025, in committee). He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted yes</a> to speed removal of derelict vehicles (Int 0857-2024, passed).</p><p>Holden also supported <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/new-protected-bike-lanes-will-connect-to-ridgewood-reservoir>protected bike lanes</a> and new sidewalks on Cypress Avenue to the Ridgewood Reservoir. These steps help. But the deaths keep coming. Enforcement on plates won’t slow a turning truck at a wide corner. Reports won’t harden a crossing.</p><p>What must change now
Build and protect the lanes. Daylight the corners. Tame the speeds. Clear the junked cars fast. Then do it again, block by block.</p><p>Call to action
District 30 cannot wait. Call Council Member Holden. Demand concrete that saves lives: protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and real enforcement on plate tampering. Tell him the numbers are up and the names are piling. Do not accept delay.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities.

The plan, presented to Queens Community Board 5 in June, calls for a two-way cycle path protected by jersey barriers and sidewalk expansions between Cooper Avenue and Cypress Hills Street. The matter summary states: 'Protected bike lanes and built-out sidewalks are coming to Cypress Avenue to provide a safe connection to Highland Park.' Council Member Bob Holden, usually a cycling skeptic, supports the project. His spokesperson said, 'This particular lane benefits those biking to and from the Ridgewood Reservoir and addresses a broader quality of life issue along Cypress Avenue.' Advocates like Bree Mobley of Ridgewood Riders back the plan, citing the area's crash history—166 crashes, 99 injuries in three years. The project targets a corridor marked by high injury and death rates, aiming to shield vulnerable road users from relentless traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
