He died on the street, his ride cut short. The NYPD is still investigating. No arrests. No relief. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>The cyclist was pronounced dead at the scene.</a></p><p>A motorcyclist, 55, struck by a BMW on Woodhaven Boulevard. The bike burst into flames. He died there. The driver had a record of speeding and reckless driving. Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>alleged</a>, &ldquo;As alleged, this defendant plowed his BMW SUV into a motorcyclist shortly after the two had a minor collision on the Long Island Expressway.

The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A cyclist, a motorcyclist, a pedestrian. In District 30, trucks killed four. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two. Cars and SUVs left dozens more with broken bodies. The violence is relentless. The pain is local.</p><h3 id=what-has-holden-done>What Has Holden Done?</h3><p>Council Member Robert F. Holden has stood on both sides of the line. He co-sponsored bills for safer crossings and tougher penalties for blocked plates. He backed new greenways and supported protected bike lanes on Cypress Avenue, a rare move for him. But he also voted <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>against ending jaywalking enforcement</a>, a law that targeted the vulnerable and did nothing to stop drivers from killing. He pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/11/dot-council-e-bike-registration-bill-is-not-necessary-to-make-streets-safer>e-bike registration</a>, a move the city’s own DOT chief called wasteful and harmful: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/11/dot-council-e-bike-registration-bill-is-not-necessary-to-make-streets-safer>&ldquo;The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal cycling behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Holden cheered the federal rollback of congestion pricing, a policy proven to cut traffic and save lives. He called it &ldquo;unfair and burdensome for working families.&rdquo; The cost is measured in blood, not tolls.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The bodies keep coming. The laws move slow.</strong> Call Council Member Holden. Demand real change: lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and an end to policies that punish the vulnerable. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article states, "Forcing horses to pound the pavement with heavy carriages in Midtown, where they compete with motor vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians, is inhumane." Seventeen council members, led by Robert Holden (bill sponsor) and Erik Bottcher (district includes stables), support the ban. Speaker Adrienne Adams has blocked a hearing and vote. The piece highlights recent incidents where bolting horses injured at least four people, including a pedicab driver.
