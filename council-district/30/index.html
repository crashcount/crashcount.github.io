He died on the street, his ride cut short. The NYPD is still investigating. No arrests. No relief. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>The cyclist was pronounced dead at the scene.</a></p><p>A motorcyclist, 55, struck by a BMW on Woodhaven Boulevard. The bike burst into flames. He died there. The driver had a record of speeding and reckless driving. Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>alleged</a>, &ldquo;As alleged, this defendant plowed his BMW SUV into a motorcyclist shortly after the two had a minor collision on the Long Island Expressway. As a result&mldr; the motorcycle burst into flames and the driver was killed.&rdquo;</p><p>In the last twelve months, District 30 saw <strong>6 deaths</strong> and <strong>623 injuries</strong> from traffic crashes. <strong>Six people suffered serious injuries.</strong> The streets are not safe. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A cyclist, a motorcyclist, a pedestrian. In District 30, trucks killed four. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two. Cars and SUVs left dozens more with broken bodies. The violence is relentless. The pain is local.</p><h3 id=what-has-holden-done>What Has Holden Done?</h3><p>Council Member Robert F. Holden has stood on both sides of the line. He co-sponsored bills for safer crossings and tougher penalties for blocked plates. He backed new greenways and supported protected bike lanes on Cypress Avenue, a rare move for him. But he also voted <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>against ending jaywalking enforcement</a>, a law that targeted the vulnerable and did nothing to stop drivers from killing. He pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/11/dot-council-e-bike-registration-bill-is-not-necessary-to-make-streets-safer>e-bike registration</a>, a move the city’s own DOT chief called wasteful and harmful: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/11/dot-council-e-bike-registration-bill-is-not-necessary-to-make-streets-safer>&ldquo;The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal cycling behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Holden cheered the federal rollback of congestion pricing, a policy proven to cut traffic and save lives. He called it &ldquo;unfair and burdensome for working families.&rdquo; The cost is measured in blood, not tolls.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The bodies keep coming. The laws move slow.</strong> Call Council Member Holden. Demand real change: lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and an end to policies that punish the vulnerable.

The bill stalls. Horses bolt, people get hurt. Speaker Adrienne Adams blocks a hearing. The city’s inaction leaves pedestrians, cyclists, and horses at risk. No change for street safety.</p><p class=mb3>On June 2, 2025, City & State NY published an opinion urging action on Ryder’s Law, the stalled NYC Council bill to ban horse-drawn carriages. The article states, "Forcing horses to pound the pavement with heavy carriages in Midtown, where they compete with motor vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians, is inhumane." Seventeen council members, led by Robert Holden (bill sponsor) and Erik Bottcher (district includes stables), support the ban. Speaker Adrienne Adams has blocked a hearing and vote. The piece highlights recent incidents where bolting horses injured at least four people, including a pedicab driver. Despite the vivid danger, the safety analyst notes: "The event text does not describe any policy or legislative change affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so there is no direct impact on their safety." The bill remains stalled in committee, with no relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers promise action but deliver delay.</p><p class=mb3>Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30) previously introduced a bill requiring e-bike registration, but it has not become law. On February 5, 2025, City Hall advanced a new proposal to regulate e-bikes used by food-delivery services. The plan would license delivery companies through the Department of Transportation, mandate certified batteries, assign rider ID cards, and require safety training. The mayor’s office calls this a 'new approach to regulating e-devices,' aiming to protect both pedestrians and e-bike riders. Transportation Alternatives supports the move, demanding comprehensive oversight of delivery apps. The proposal also sets fines for companies that fail safety standards. Holden’s earlier bill remains stalled, while the city promises stricter rules to curb chaos and injury on the streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight over Manhattan’s $9 entry fee now pits safety against politics.</p><p class=mb3>On January 30, 2025, Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30) welcomed reports that the Trump Administration may halt New York City’s congestion pricing plan. The policy, effective since January 5, charges drivers $9 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. The matter, titled 'New York officials, orgs denounce reports of Trump move to halt congestion pricing,' drew sharp lines. Holden called the toll a 'scam' and hoped the federal government would end it. Transit advocates and city officials, including MTA CEO Janno Lieber and Comptroller Brad Lander, warned that stopping the program would mean more traffic, dirtier air, and worse transit. Lieber said, 'Better bus service, faster drive times and safer streets are good for all New Yorkers.' The debate now centers on whether to keep or kill a measure credited with reducing cars and making streets safer for those outside vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'A taxi turned right. A bike turned left. Steel struck bone.' The 23-year-old cyclist was thrown to the pavement, suffering crush injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot. The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'his leg crushed. No helmet. No horn. Just pain, shock, and cold January light.' The only contributing factor cited in the report is 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion.' The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but lists no driver errors or additional contributing factors. The crash highlights the lethal consequences when turning vehicles and vulnerable road users cross paths in New York City’s chaotic streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
