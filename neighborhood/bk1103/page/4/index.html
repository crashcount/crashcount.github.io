Six seriously hurt.</strong> In Gravesend (West), the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have killed four people and left six with wounds that will not heal. Two of the dead were older New Yorkers, crossing with the light, doing nothing wrong. One was a 95-year-old woman, struck by a left-turning van as she walked with her aide. Her family remembered her as &ldquo;a very active lady&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Everybody knows her&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>said her daughter</a>. The NYPD did not charge the driver. The street stayed the same.</p><p>A mother and her two daughters died on a sidewalk. The driver had a suspended license, over 90 violations, and a taste for speed. She bragged about it. &ldquo;She always talked about driving fast,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/31/us-news/miriam-yarimi-accused-of-killing-nyc-mom-2-kids-allegedly-bragged-about-speeding/>an acquaintance told the press</a>. The city let her keep driving.

Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians pay the price. Cars and trucks do most of the harm: all four deaths, all but one serious injury. Bikes and motorcycles are not the killers here. The danger comes in steel and glass, moving fast, turning left, not stopping.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—and What They Haven&rsquo;t</h3><p>The city passed new laws. Speed cameras now run all day. The council can lower speed limits. But in Gravesend (West), the blood keeps flowing. Drivers with long records stay on the road. Police let killers walk. No statement from the council. No call from the board. No change at the corner where the old woman died.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-now><strong>Call to Action: Demand Action Now</strong></h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

Council Member Susan Zhuang arrested at a Gravesend shelter protest. City bans vendors on Brooklyn Bridge, citing pedestrian safety. BQE overhaul stalls until 2029. Bus lanes, train upgrades, and green space fights mark a city in flux.</p><p class=mb3>This roundup, published December 31, 2024, surveys Brooklyn’s major transportation and public safety stories for 2025. Council Member Susan Zhuang (District 43) was arrested and charged with assault during a protest against a Gravesend homeless shelter, highlighting fierce local opposition. The city’s new ban on vendors along the Brooklyn Bridge walkway took effect in January, aiming to reduce sidewalk congestion and improve pedestrian safety. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway’s long-awaited renovation faces further delays, with major construction not expected until 2029; short-term fixes are planned. The MTA upgraded the G train’s signal system, promising better service. Flatbush Avenue may see new bus lanes to speed up transit. The article quotes City Hall calling the bridge vendor ban a 'public safety issue due to the sprawling stalls taking up sidewalk space and causing congestion for pedestrians.' Zhuang’s arrest and the city’s actions underscore the ongoing tension between public safety, mobility, and community resistance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
