Six seriously hurt.</strong> In Gravesend (West), the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have killed four people and left six with wounds that will not heal. Two of the dead were older New Yorkers, crossing with the light, doing nothing wrong. One was a 95-year-old woman, struck by a left-turning van as she walked with her aide. Her family remembered her as &ldquo;a very active lady&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Everybody knows her&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>said her daughter</a>. The NYPD did not charge the driver. The street stayed the same.</p><p>A mother and her two daughters died on a sidewalk. The driver had a suspended license, over 90 violations, and a taste for speed. She bragged about it. &ldquo;She always talked about driving fast,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/31/us-news/miriam-yarimi-accused-of-killing-nyc-mom-2-kids-allegedly-bragged-about-speeding/>an acquaintance told the press</a>. The city let her keep driving. The law let her keep killing.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>680 injured. 1,172 crashes.</strong> In three years, the streets of Gravesend (West) have become a gauntlet. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians pay the price. Cars and trucks do most of the harm: all four deaths, all but one serious injury. Bikes and motorcycles are not the killers here. The danger comes in steel and glass, moving fast, turning left, not stopping.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—and What They Haven&rsquo;t</h3><p>The city passed new laws. Speed cameras now run all day. The council can lower speed limits. But in Gravesend (West), the blood keeps flowing. Drivers with long records stay on the road. Police let killers walk. No statement from the council. No call from the board. No change at the corner where the old woman died.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-now><strong>Call to Action: Demand Action Now</strong></h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets where children and elders do not die for crossing with the light. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city planned to move cyclists next to car traffic, but the court granted an emergency restraining order after advocates appealed. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the lane a 'critical safety project.' City Hall insists the reconfiguration is legal and claims the appeal delays 'easing the safety concerns plaguing Williamsburg parents.'
