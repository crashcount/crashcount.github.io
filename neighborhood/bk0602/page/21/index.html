Seven left with serious injuries.</strong> Six hundred sixty-five injured in three and a half years. The dead do not speak. The injured limp, or do not walk at all. The city moves on. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> One death, thirty-one moderate injuries, two serious injuries. Taxis killed and maimed. Bikes and motorcycles wounded, but the weight of steel and speed falls hardest from behind a wheel. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, thirteen children were hurt. Three people suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. No one died, but the cost is not measured only in funerals.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-plans-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Plans, and the Waiting</h3><p>The city says it will act. The Department of Transportation promises a new Flatbush Avenue. <strong>Two car lanes gone. Bus lanes in the center. Pedestrian islands.</strong> The plan is bold on paper. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city calls it a world-class corridor. The street calls it a delay.</p><p>Since 2019, <strong>fifty-five people have been killed or severely injured</strong> on Flatbush Avenue alone. The city knows this. &ldquo;City transportation officials said the changes would also improve street safety along the stretch, noting 55 people have been killed or severely injured in car crashes there since 2019&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-flatbush-avenue-gets-bus-lanes-pedestrian-islands-under-dot-plan>reported Gothamist</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-action-not-words>The Next Fight: Action, Not Words</h3><p><strong>Promises do not stop cars.</strong> Plans do not heal broken bones. The city must move faster. Residents must demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them: <strong>No more waiting. No more bodies. No more blood on the street.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Joseph expressed disappointment: 'New Yorkers deserve to know how the DOT is working to make school streets safer.' Councilmember Shahana Hanif also criticized DOT’s inability to track safety projects. Despite Commissioner Rodriguez’s promise of 100 safety projects, the agency denied a FOIL request, claiming costs are not tracked. Advocates and families condemned the lack of accountability.

The matter, titled 'How Much Does DOT Spend to Keep Kids Safe Outside of Schools? The Agency Won’t Say,' exposes DOT’s refusal to disclose project costs or salaries tied to school safety. Councilmember Shahana Hanif joined Joseph in criticizing DOT’s lack of transparency. Both called for clear tracking of safety improvements around schools. DOT denied a Freedom of Information Law request, claiming no records exist and that costs are not broken out from its $1.3-billion budget. Advocates and families voiced outrage. The Department of Education also refused to discuss spending. The city’s silence leaves children exposed on dangerous streets, with no accountability for safety investments.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection lacked a pedestrian crosswalk. Council Member Justin Brannan attended the vigil and tweeted, 'Confronting traffic violence also means taking personal responsibility [and] safe driving habits. It will take all of us.' The driver remained at the scene but faced no charges. Fruchter’s son Lev condemned the New York Automobile Insurance Plan for letting dangerous drivers stay insured. Community leaders, including NYC Comptroller Brad Lander and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, joined in mourning and frustration. Fruchter’s wife Rachel was also killed by a reckless driver in 1997, a tragedy that helped spark Vision Zero. Nearly three decades later, traffic laws remain weak. No systemic change.

The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install bollards at reconstructed sidewalks, curb extensions, and pedestrian ramps, especially where accessibility upgrades are made. It mandates a study on bollard effectiveness in high pedestrian areas and demands annual reporting on installations and requests. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no enactment.
