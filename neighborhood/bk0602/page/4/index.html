Seven left with serious injuries.</strong> Six hundred sixty-five injured in three and a half years. The dead do not speak. The injured limp, or do not walk at all. The city moves on. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> One death, thirty-one moderate injuries, two serious injuries. Taxis killed and maimed. Bikes and motorcycles wounded, but the weight of steel and speed falls hardest from behind a wheel. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, thirteen children were hurt. Three people suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. No one died, but the cost is not measured only in funerals.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-plans-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Plans, and the Waiting</h3><p>The city says it will act. The Department of Transportation promises a new Flatbush Avenue. <strong>Two car lanes gone. Bus lanes in the center. Pedestrian islands.</strong> The plan is bold on paper. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city calls it a world-class corridor. The street calls it a delay.</p><p>Since 2019, <strong>fifty-five people have been killed or severely injured</strong> on Flatbush Avenue alone. The city knows this. &ldquo;City transportation officials said the changes would also improve street safety along the stretch, noting 55 people have been killed or severely injured in car crashes there since 2019&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-flatbush-avenue-gets-bus-lanes-pedestrian-islands-under-dot-plan>reported Gothamist</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-action-not-words>The Next Fight: Action, Not Words</h3><p><strong>Promises do not stop cars.</strong> Plans do not heal broken bones. The city must move faster. Residents must demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them: <strong>No more waiting. No more bodies. No more blood on the street.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill remains pending, with no endorsement yet from Governor Hochul. The Streetsblog article, 'Helicopter Deaths, Fast and Slow,' highlights the recent fatal crash near Jersey City that killed six and draws a stark comparison to the ongoing economic and human toll of helicopter noise. Carroll’s bill is described as the 'gold-standard' for taxing helicopter noise, with estimates that it could reduce flights by 30 to 50 percent. Carroll urges action, calling on the public to pressure Hochul to support the measure. The article underscores that the distress over crash deaths should extend to the daily suffering caused by helicopter noise, which inflicts millions in damages and degrades quality of life for city residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gonzalez criticized New York’s laws, saying, 'The law is very restrictive in allowing district attorney’s to pursue murder charges in these types of cases.' He noted Yarimi’s 21 speeding and five red-light tickets did not trigger license points or insurance penalties. Gonzalez questioned why the NYPD cannot seize cars based on repeated violations and called for legislative change. He endorsed State Sen. Andrew Gounardes’s bill (S7621), which would require speed limiter technology for drivers with six or more automated enforcement tickets in a year, describing it as a way to fight 'violent car culture.'

Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death.

It permits New York City to use speed cameras not just for speeding, but also to enforce against license plate obstruction, concealment, and distortion. The measure also extends speed camera enforcement in school zones. Gounardes leads the charge, aiming to close loopholes that let reckless drivers dodge accountability.

Compromise and conflict shape Fifth Avenue’s future.</p><p class=mb3>Council Member Shahana Hanif (District 39) and Community Board 6 launched a survey on April 2, 2025, to collect resident and merchant feedback on the Park Slope Open Streets program. The matter, titled 'Merchants call for compromise as Park Slope Open Streets program faces scrutiny,' centers on the proposed closure of Fifth Avenue every Saturday from May to October. Hanif’s action: gathering input and relaying concerns to the Department of Transportation (DOT) before a final decision. The survey showed strong public support—455 out of 489 respondents favored the program—but merchant opinions split. Some praised increased foot traffic and sales; others reported steep losses. Critics cited business access, traffic, and e-bike safety. Merchants petitioned Hanif and DOT for a thorough review and recovery plan. Community Board 6’s Mike Racioppo recommended proper funding and expansion. The DOT has not yet ruled. The debate spotlights the tension between public space and business survival.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, stalled for years in Albany, gained urgency after a fatal Brooklyn crash on April 1, 2025. Gallagher, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes and city Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied at Borough Hall, urging swift passage. The bill targets drivers with 11 or more license points in 24 months, or six camera violations in a year. Gallagher said, 'A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.' Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.' The legislation mirrors past efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act, aiming to hold reckless drivers accountable and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
