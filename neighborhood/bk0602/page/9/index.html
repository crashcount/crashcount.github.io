Seven left with serious injuries.</strong> Six hundred sixty-five injured in three and a half years. The dead do not speak. The injured limp, or do not walk at all. The city moves on. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> One death, thirty-one moderate injuries, two serious injuries. Taxis killed and maimed. Bikes and motorcycles wounded, but the weight of steel and speed falls hardest from behind a wheel. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, thirteen children were hurt. Three people suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. No one died, but the cost is not measured only in funerals.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-plans-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Plans, and the Waiting</h3><p>The city says it will act. The Department of Transportation promises a new Flatbush Avenue. <strong>Two car lanes gone. Bus lanes in the center. Pedestrian islands.</strong> The plan is bold on paper. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city calls it a world-class corridor. The street calls it a delay.</p><p>Since 2019, <strong>fifty-five people have been killed or severely injured</strong> on Flatbush Avenue alone. The city knows this. &ldquo;City transportation officials said the changes would also improve street safety along the stretch, noting 55 people have been killed or severely injured in car crashes there since 2019&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-flatbush-avenue-gets-bus-lanes-pedestrian-islands-under-dot-plan>reported Gothamist</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-action-not-words>The Next Fight: Action, Not Words</h3><p><strong>Promises do not stop cars.</strong> Plans do not heal broken bones. The city must move faster. Residents must demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them: <strong>No more waiting. No more bodies.

The fight shapes the future for housing, space, and city life.</p><p class=mb3>On October 3, 2024, the City Council began reviewing Mayor Adams’s City of Yes zoning reform, focusing on the elimination of mandatory parking requirements for new developments. The proposal, under the Town Center Zoning plan, aims to boost small-scale, mixed-use housing. Council Members Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler voiced strong support, with Hanif stating, 'Parking mandates block housing, they block extra space for the folks living in communities, they block plazas, and the ability to live in a climate friendly city.' Restler called the policy vital for Brooklyn. Department of City Planning Director Dan Garodnick acknowledged the importance of removing parking mandates but noted the plan could proceed without it. The Council faces pushback from low-density, transit-poor areas. Progressive groups and experts argue that ending parking mandates is overdue and would reshape housing, public space, and climate policy citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police cite driver failure to yield right-of-way as cause.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 2021 Toyota sedan was making a right turn on 4 Avenue in Brooklyn at 8:15 when it collided with a bicyclist traveling straight ahead. The bicyclist, a 25-year-old male, was partially ejected from his bike and sustained contusions and injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot. The point of impact was the sedan's right front quarter panel and the bike's left front bumper. The report explicitly lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor, indicating the driver did not yield to the bicyclist. The bicyclist was not wearing any safety equipment. No other contributing factors related to the victim were noted. The collision caused visible damage to the sedan's right front bumper. The driver’s error in yielding right-of-way directly led to the bicyclist’s injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The law requires thirty. Riders wait. Buses crawl. Advocates rage. The city drags its feet. Streets stay dangerous. The promise of safer, faster transit goes unmet.</p><p class=mb3>On August 5, 2024, the Department of Transportation revealed it has proposed only seven miles of bus priority lanes for the year—less than a quarter of the thirty miles required annually by the Streets Master Plan law. This marks the lowest bus lane mileage since 2018. The matter, titled 'Adams Has Proposed Just 7 Miles of Bus Lanes This Year — Less Than 1/4 of Requirement,' has drawn sharp criticism. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie called it 'unacceptable that Mayor Adams has not prioritized improving bus speeds, service, and reliability.' Scott Stringer accused the administration of using 'community engagement as an excuse to not get things done.' Brad Lander pledged to push for more dedicated bus lanes. Riders like Alex Gean described daily gridlock. The DOT claims more lanes are coming, but offers no details. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain at risk as the city fails to meet its own safety and mobility targets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
