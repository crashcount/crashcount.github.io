Seven left with serious injuries.</strong> Six hundred sixty-five injured in three and a half years. The dead do not speak. The injured limp, or do not walk at all. The city moves on. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> One death, thirty-one moderate injuries, two serious injuries. Taxis killed and maimed. Bikes and motorcycles wounded, but the weight of steel and speed falls hardest from behind a wheel. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, thirteen children were hurt. Three people suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. No one died, but the cost is not measured only in funerals.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-plans-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Plans, and the Waiting</h3><p>The city says it will act. The Department of Transportation promises a new Flatbush Avenue. <strong>Two car lanes gone. Bus lanes in the center. Pedestrian islands.</strong> The plan is bold on paper. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city calls it a world-class corridor. The street calls it a delay.</p><p>Since 2019, <strong>fifty-five people have been killed or severely injured</strong> on Flatbush Avenue alone. The city knows this. &ldquo;City transportation officials said the changes would also improve street safety along the stretch, noting 55 people have been killed or severely injured in car crashes there since 2019&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-flatbush-avenue-gets-bus-lanes-pedestrian-islands-under-dot-plan>reported Gothamist</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-action-not-words>The Next Fight: Action, Not Words</h3><p><strong>Promises do not stop cars.</strong> Plans do not heal broken bones. The city must move faster. Residents must demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them: <strong>No more waiting. No more bodies.
