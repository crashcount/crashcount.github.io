Seven left with serious injuries.</strong> Six hundred sixty-five injured in three and a half years. The dead do not speak. The injured limp, or do not walk at all. The city moves on. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> One death, thirty-one moderate injuries, two serious injuries. Taxis killed and maimed. Bikes and motorcycles wounded, but the weight of steel and speed falls hardest from behind a wheel. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, thirteen children were hurt. Three people suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. No one died, but the cost is not measured only in funerals.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-plans-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Plans, and the Waiting</h3><p>The city says it will act. The Department of Transportation promises a new Flatbush Avenue. <strong>Two car lanes gone. Bus lanes in the center. Pedestrian islands.</strong> The plan is bold on paper. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city calls it a world-class corridor. The street calls it a delay.</p><p>Since 2019, <strong>fifty-five people have been killed or severely injured</strong> on Flatbush Avenue alone. The city knows this. &ldquo;City transportation officials said the changes would also improve street safety along the stretch, noting 55 people have been killed or severely injured in car crashes there since 2019&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-flatbush-avenue-gets-bus-lanes-pedestrian-islands-under-dot-plan>reported Gothamist</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-action-not-words>The Next Fight: Action, Not Words</h3><p><strong>Promises do not stop cars.</strong> Plans do not heal broken bones. The city must move faster. Residents must demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them: <strong>No more waiting. No more bodies. No more blood on the street.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure calls for redesigning streets to protect all users, not just drivers. The vote was not unanimous—several senators voted no, but the majority carried it through.

Both vehicles were traveling straight when the crash occurred. The report states, "Both drivers distracted." The impact left a 46-year-old male driver with severe crush injuries to his knee and lower leg. The police report lists "Driver Inattention/Distraction" as the contributing factor for both drivers. The injured man was not wearing a seatbelt, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. Additionally, a 41-year-old female front passenger suffered chest injuries and a concussion. The narrative describes the aftermath: "Metal folded. A 46-year-old man, unbelted, crushed at the knee. Both drivers distracted. The street fell quiet, holding the weight of what could not be undone."

Council Member Alexa Avilés, representing District 38, serves as vice chair of the Brooklyn Marine Terminal Taskforce, leading community engagement. The plan includes an $80 million city investment and a $15 million state investment in cold storage to reduce truck traffic. Rep.

Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.'

The collision injured a 39-year-old male front passenger in the SUV, who sustained a fractured and dislocated shoulder. The passenger was conscious and restrained by a lap belt. The report identifies the box truck driver’s error as "Following Too Closely," leading to the crash. Both drivers were licensed, with the truck driver operating a 2020 Hino box truck and the SUV driver in a 2014 Ford SUV. The impact occurred at the left front bumper of the SUV and the right front bumper of the truck.

No points. No suspensions. Gianaris backs a bill to yank registrations after five violations. Victims’ families and DOT demand action. The loophole leaves reckless drivers free to kill.</p><p class=mb3>Queens Senator Michael Gianaris, with Assemblymember William Magnarelli, introduced a bill to suspend vehicle registrations after five speed or red light camera violations in one year. The measure remains in committee. The bill responds to a fatal flaw: 'We have no mechanism right now, under law, to crack down on extremely reckless drivers,' said Brooklyn State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The current law lets drivers rack up dozens of camera tickets and keep driving, since no points are added to licenses. Gianaris’s bill aims to close this loophole. DOT and crash victims’ families, including Juliane Williams, whose daughter was killed by a speeding driver, press for stronger penalties and expansion of the red light camera program. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired with little effect. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while repeat offenders face few real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced March 19, 2024, the bill would require the Department of Transportation to paint and install overhead school safety signs on every street with a school entrance. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing safety signs near schools.' Council Member Susan Zhuang leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Gennaro, Won, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Louis, Cabán, Restler, Farías, Banks, and Riley as co-sponsors. The bill aims to alert drivers to the presence of school-aged children and pedestrians. It remains in committee, with no vote or enactment date set. The measure targets a simple truth: children cross streets, drivers often do not see them. Signs alone will not stop cars, but they mark danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident came days after Governor Hochul’s National Guard deployment in the transit system. Simon stated, 'The Governor's recent deployment of the National Guard was unwarranted and caused fear rather than a sense of safety.' Other officials, including Brian Cunningham and Lester Chang, debated the effectiveness of increased policing and called for more investment in mental health and gun safety. The matter, titled 'NYC subway shooting a ‘wake up call’,' underscores deep divides on how to protect riders. Simon’s stance highlights the risk of heavy-handed security measures fueling anxiety, not safety, for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
