Seven left with serious injuries.</strong> Six hundred sixty-five injured in three and a half years. The dead do not speak. The injured limp, or do not walk at all. The city moves on. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> One death, thirty-one moderate injuries, two serious injuries. Taxis killed and maimed. Bikes and motorcycles wounded, but the weight of steel and speed falls hardest from behind a wheel. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, thirteen children were hurt. Three people suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. No one died, but the cost is not measured only in funerals.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-plans-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Plans, and the Waiting</h3><p>The city says it will act. The Department of Transportation promises a new Flatbush Avenue. <strong>Two car lanes gone. Bus lanes in the center. Pedestrian islands.</strong> The plan is bold on paper. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city calls it a world-class corridor. The street calls it a delay.</p><p>Since 2019, <strong>fifty-five people have been killed or severely injured</strong> on Flatbush Avenue alone. The city knows this. &ldquo;City transportation officials said the changes would also improve street safety along the stretch, noting 55 people have been killed or severely injured in car crashes there since 2019&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-flatbush-avenue-gets-bus-lanes-pedestrian-islands-under-dot-plan>reported Gothamist</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-action-not-words>The Next Fight: Action, Not Words</h3><p><strong>Promises do not stop cars.</strong> Plans do not heal broken bones. The city must move faster. Residents must demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them: <strong>No more waiting. No more bodies. No more blood on the street.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

City pays more, gets less. Riders face fare hikes, no better service. State hoards surplus, starves transit. Lawmakers protest. Suburbs dodge taxes. The city shoulders the load. Riders pay the price. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Governor Hochul’s 2023 state budget proposal, analyzed March 3, 2023, keeps New York State’s long-running refusal to match MTA funding under law 18-b. The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt. The budget leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as transit stagnates and car dominance persists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency outlined two options: diverting traffic onto local streets or constructing a bypass road. The matter, described as 'a controversial possibility reminiscent of an earlier plan,' sparked outrage. Assembly Member Robert Carroll slammed the idea of sending trucks onto residential blocks as 'insane.' Lara Birnback of the Brooklyn Heights Association called the plan disruptive and wasteful. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez highlighted public calls for 'safer bike and pedestrian connections' and new green space. No bill number or committee was cited. The plan remains a proposal, with no set price or location.
