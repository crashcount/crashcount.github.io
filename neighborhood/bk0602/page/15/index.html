Their words cut through: New York’s streets belong to people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher (District 50) joined Robert Carroll in a public statement opposing Governor Hochul’s indefinite delay of congestion pricing. The op-ed, titled 'Two Assembly Pols: Congestion Pricing is Good Policy — Democrats Should Embrace It,' argues the governor’s action is 'effectively a cancellation.' Gallagher and Carroll stress that congestion pricing is essential for funding the MTA and improving public transit. They write, 'Congestion pricing does both and there is no fair or viable alternative way to fund the MTA’s capital needs at this juncture.' The statement warns that the delay will shelve critical projects and worsen conditions for all who rely on safe, accessible streets. Gallagher’s stance is clear: the city’s future depends on prioritizing transit and public space over traffic and private cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Carroll and Gallagher, both long-time supporters, stress that congestion pricing is vital for funding the MTA’s capital needs and for reducing traffic and pollution. They warn that the governor’s move will stall key transit projects and harm New Yorkers who rely on public transportation. The members urge Democrats to embrace the policy, stating, 'It is past time for New York to join such cities as London, Milan, Stockholm, and Singapore and implement congestion pricing without further delay.'

Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen.

Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'

The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when a 2007 Mercedes SUV, traveling west and making a left turn, struck him with the vehicle's left front bumper. The pedestrian sustained abrasions to his elbow and lower arm and remained conscious. The report cites the driver’s failure to yield right-of-way and improper turning as contributing factors. The pedestrian’s crossing with the signal is noted but not listed as a contributing factor. The SUV showed no damage, and the driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally. This crash highlights driver errors in yielding and turning that endangered a vulnerable pedestrian.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Both drivers distracted. Metal folded. A 46-year-old man, unbelted, crushed at the knee. The street fell silent, bearing the cost of inattention.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, two sedans collided head-on at the corner of 8th Avenue and Union Street in Brooklyn at 20:14. Both vehicles were traveling straight when the crash occurred. The report states, "Both drivers distracted." The impact left a 46-year-old male driver with severe crush injuries to his knee and lower leg. The police report lists "Driver Inattention/Distraction" as the contributing factor for both drivers. The injured man was not wearing a seatbelt, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. Additionally, a 41-year-old female front passenger suffered chest injuries and a concussion. The narrative describes the aftermath: "Metal folded. A 46-year-old man, unbelted, crushed at the knee. Both drivers distracted. The street fell quiet, holding the weight of what could not be undone." The collision underscores the danger when drivers lose focus behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
