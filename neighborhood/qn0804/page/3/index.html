Five serious injuries. Four hundred forty-nine hurt.</strong> These are not numbers from a war zone. They are the cost of moving through Jamaica Estates-Holliswood since 2022, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in scars and limps. The pain is quiet, but it does not stop.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians are struck at intersections and in the crosswalk.</strong> An 83-year-old woman killed by a box truck turning right at Union Turnpike and 193rd Street. A 29-year-old man, crossing with the signal, left with deep wounds to his legs. A 74-year-old man, not even in the roadway, cut down by a backing sedan. The street does not care about age or reason. It only takes.</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the harm.</strong> No cyclist has died here in three years, but the threat is always present. Trucks, sedans, SUVs—these are the weapons. The victims are often walking, sometimes just standing. The violence is routine. The shock is not.</p><p><strong>Crashes are not rare.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 224 crashes. One hundred fifty-nine injured. One left with injuries so severe they may never heal. The numbers do not fall. They hold steady, year after year. The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. The city can act now, but has not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Local leaders talk of safety, but the street remains the same.

The bill, introduced January 8, 2025, in the New York State Assembly, is titled: "Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles." Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage. Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes. The measure signals strong legislative support for systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA board is set to vote on the $9 toll to enter Manhattan’s business district, effective January 5. The matter, described as 'NYC congestion toll would hit neighborhoods with some of worst vacancy rates in city,' has drawn fire from both Republicans and Democrats. Rozic said, 'Affordability is really the most important thing that voters, that constituents, that people on the street, talk to us about... keep the pause.' Opponents argue the toll will worsen economic pain in areas with high storefront vacancy. Despite the uproar, the policy’s impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety remains unaddressed in this debate.

The rear vehicle, a 2008 Nissan sedan, impacted the center back end of the front vehicle, a 2017 Honda sedan. The driver of the rear vehicle, a 48-year-old man, sustained a back injury and was in shock. He was wearing a lap belt and harness and was not ejected. The report explicitly lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor twice for the rear driver. Both drivers were licensed in New York and were going straight ahead at the time of the crash.

The bill slashes bounties, lets the city ban whistleblowers, and carves out new loopholes for polluters. Critics warn it will silence the public and let engines poison streets unchecked.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 941, sponsored by Council Member James Gennaro and drafted with the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), is under City Council debate as of September 13, 2024. The bill, titled 'Council Bill Could Chill Citizen Reporting That Dramatically Boosted Idling Enforcement,' would give the city broad power to disqualify public participants from reporting idling, reduce fines for vehicles with anti-idling tech, and halve citizen bounties. It also allows school buses to idle up to 15 minutes and imposes a new code of conduct for enforcers. The Adams administration supports capping bounties but wants higher fines. Opponents, including the New York Clean Air Collective, say the bill 'weaponizes rules that chill participation' and will 'watch while companies like Con Ed, Verizon, and Amazon steal New York’s breath.' The Council is preparing for a hearing as debate intensifies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets will change.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0746-2024, now Local Law 94 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 12, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
