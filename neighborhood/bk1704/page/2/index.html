One left with wounds so deep they count as serious.</strong> These are not numbers from a war zone. They are from the last twelve months, on the blocks where children walk to school and elders cross for groceries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Sedans and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In the last year, cars killed one person and left dozens battered.

The violence is lopsided, and it is relentless.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost-a-name-a-sound-a-call-for-help>The Human Cost: A Name, A Sound, A Call for Help</h3><p>On May 14, Maurette Lafleur, 68, crossed Rutland Road with the light. A Mercedes driver turned left and struck her. She died in the crosswalk. A neighbor heard it all. “I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>said Lorna Johnson</a>. The city moved on. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>What have local leaders done?</strong> The silence is heavy. No new bills. No public fight for safer crossings. No push for lower speed limits here. The city has the power to set 20 mph limits after Sammy’s Law. They have not used it. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany stalls. The council and the mayor could act. They have not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-choice-is-yours>What Comes Next: The Choice Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, another family risks the call. <strong>Demand action.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Tell them to build streets that protect people, not just cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution, introduced April 24, 2025, calls for 'requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits.' Council Member Lincoln Restler leads, joined by Salaam, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Banks, and Brannan. The bill would force drivers with eleven or more points in eighteen months, or six speed/red light camera tickets in a year, to install speed-limiting tech. The Council cites data: 265 killed, 52,949 injured on city streets in 2023. The measure aims to put a brake on reckless driving. The committee has not yet advanced the resolution. Vulnerable road users wait for action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure calls on Albany to let police list a car’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on a Notice of Violation when the license plate is missing, concealed, obscured, or distorted. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation to amend the vehicle and traffic law to permit a motor vehicle’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to be listed in a Notice of Violation, instead of license plate number, in circumstances when a license plate of such vehicle is missing, concealed, obscured, or distorted.' Council Members Chris Banks (primary sponsor, District 42) and Yusef Salaam (co-sponsor, District 9) back the bill. The law now demands a plate number on tickets, letting violators escape if plates are unreadable. The bill would let cops use the VIN, closing a loophole that shields reckless drivers from accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
