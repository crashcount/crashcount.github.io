No new bills. No public fight for safer crossings. No push for lower speed limits here. The city has the power to set 20 mph limits after Sammy’s Law. They have not used it. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany stalls. The council and the mayor could act. They have not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-choice-is-yours>What Comes Next: The Choice Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, another family risks the call. <strong>Demand action.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Tell them to build streets that protect people, not just cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year.
