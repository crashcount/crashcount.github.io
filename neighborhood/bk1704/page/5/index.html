A Mercedes driver turned left and struck her. She died in the crosswalk. A neighbor heard it all. “I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>said Lorna Johnson</a>. The city moved on. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>What have local leaders done?</strong> The silence is heavy. No new bills. No public fight for safer crossings. No push for lower speed limits here. The city has the power to set 20 mph limits after Sammy’s Law. They have not used it. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany stalls. The council and the mayor could act. They have not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-choice-is-yours>What Comes Next: The Choice Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, another family risks the call. <strong>Demand action.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Tell them to build streets that protect people, not just cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill orders the Commissioner of Transportation, with the Chancellor of New York City Public Schools, to conduct yearly studies to find non-operational schools. The matter title reads: 'Annual study to identify non-operational schools and the subsequent removal of speed cameras from eliminated school speed zones.' Council Members Chris Banks (District 42, primary sponsor) and Kamillah Hanks (District 49, co-sponsor) back the measure. If passed, speed cameras must be removed from zones tied to closed schools. The bill’s plain language summary confirms cameras will be pulled from these areas. No safety analyst has weighed in, but the removal of cameras means less oversight where children and families once crossed. The bill awaits further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Now, every case number, status, and decision must be public. The move cracks open city data, exposing delays and denials that shape street danger.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0468-2024, now enacted, came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The Council passed it on October 23, 2024; it became law November 22, 2024, as Local Law 113. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the department of transportation posting information on traffic-control device and speed reducer requests on its website.” Council Member Kalman Yeger led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law orders DOT to publish every request for traffic signals and speed humps—case number, subject, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial, and timeline if approved. The public can now track what the city does, or fails to do, when streets need taming. This transparency exposes the machinery behind every crosswalk, signal, and speed bump—vital for anyone who walks, bikes, or rides in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The e-bike was traveling south and making a right turn when the collision occurred, impacting the center front end of the bike. The rider suffered a head injury and was unconscious at the scene. The report lists no contributing factors or driver errors explicitly, but the violent ejection and injury severity indicate a failure in controlling the vehicle during the maneuver. The rider held a permit license from New York but no other contributing factors such as helmet use or pedestrian actions were noted.

The bill was laid over by committee on February 10, 2025. The measure would take effect immediately if passed.
