A Mercedes driver turned left and struck her. She died in the crosswalk. A neighbor heard it all. “I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>said Lorna Johnson</a>. The city moved on. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>What have local leaders done?</strong> The silence is heavy. No new bills. No public fight for safer crossings. No push for lower speed limits here. The city has the power to set 20 mph limits after Sammy’s Law. They have not used it. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany stalls. The council and the mayor could act. They have not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-choice-is-yours>What Comes Next: The Choice Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, another family risks the call. <strong>Demand action.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Tell them to build streets that protect people, not just cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure would let New York City set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets in the Open Streets program. The matter title reads: 'authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Carlina Rivera. The committee approved the resolution with strong support. The bill targets streets where pedestrians and cyclists mix with traffic. Lower speeds mean fewer crashes and less severe injuries. The council’s action puts pressure on Albany to give the city the power to protect people where they are most exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered," would force all e-bikes, e-scooters, and similar vehicles not already covered by DMV rules to register with the Department of Transportation and display a visible plate. Council Member Inna Vernikov led as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Farías, Riley, Brannan, and many others. The bill was laid over in committee on December 11, 2024. The measure aims to track these vehicles, but its impact on vulnerable road users remains unassessed.

Introduced March 7, 2024, it urges Albany to pass and sign a law creating unlimited subway and bus transfers within two hours for pay-per-ride users. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation, which would create unlimited transfers within the two-hour period of paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority subway or bus fare for pay-per-ride users.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez leads as primary sponsor, joined by Riley, Stevens, Hanif, Won, Feliz, Salaam, Hanks, Farías, De La Rosa, Cabán, Williams, Hudson, Ung, Ossé, Banks, and Holden. The sponsors argue the current one-transfer rule hits hardest for riders with long, complex trips, often in transit deserts. They demand fare equity for all, not just those with short, easy rides.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
