Eight seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months, 252 people have been injured in traffic crashes across East Flatbush-Remsen Village. The deadliest blows fall on the old and the young. A 65-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Rutland Road and E 95th Street this spring. She was crushed by a sedan making a left turn. She never made it to the other side. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Crashes come steady, not sudden.</strong> In just the first half of this year, crashes are up.
