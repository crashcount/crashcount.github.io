In the last twelve months, <strong>120 neighbors were injured in 175 crashes</strong>. Not one death, but five left with wounds so deep they count as serious. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A man loses his leg on East 183rd. A child, not yet old enough to speak, is crushed by a sedan on Grand Concourse. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-toll-of-machines>The Toll of Machines</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs strike most often.</strong> Sedans alone left at least ten pedestrians hurt, two with serious injuries. SUVs, buses, mopeds—they all take their share. No bikes killed or maimed, but the threat is constant. The roll call of pain is long: 463 injured since 2022, five with wounds that will not heal. The numbers are cold, but the truth is colder.</p><h3 id=leaders-speak-but-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Speak, But Streets Stay Deadly</h3><p>The city says it is fighting back. &ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-looking-for-suspect-in-fatal-hit-and-run-on-major-deegan-expressway-nypd-says>said Police Commissioner Edward Caban</a>.

Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes. The measure signals strong legislative support for systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It targets drivers who block bike lanes. Cameras will catch violators. Streets choke with cars. Cyclists swerve, risk death. Lawmakers push for clear lanes. The city’s riders wait for action.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill 803 was introduced on January 6, 2025, in the New York State Assembly. The bill sits in the sponsorship stage. It aims to 'establish in the city of New York a bicycle lane safety program to enforce certain restrictions on the use of bicycle lanes and/or protected bicycle lanes by means of bicycle lane photo devices.' Primary sponsor Zohran Mamdani leads a coalition of fourteen co-sponsors, including Brian Cunningham, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, and Harvey Epstein. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. If passed, it would allow automated cameras to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, a move designed to keep lanes clear for cyclists and prevent deadly crashes. Lawmakers back the measure, but the city’s vulnerable road users still face daily danger until enforcement begins.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
