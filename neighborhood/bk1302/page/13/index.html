Three more are left with serious injuries. <strong>One child did not make it home.</strong> In the last year alone, 187 people were hurt in 373 crashes. One was killed. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty chairs, and families who will never be whole again. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and children pay first.</strong> In the last twelve months, 18 people under 18 were hurt. One died. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. Trucks and buses added to the toll. No one on a bike died, but that is luck, not safety. The street does not forgive. Review the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>collision records</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But in Coney Island-Sea Gate, the blood dries faster than the promises. <strong>Speed still kills.</strong> The council can lower the limit to 20 mph. They have not. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud. The clock ticks. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> It is policy. It is choice. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to keep the cameras on.

The intersection, despite a history of crashes, has not been redesigned. No charges were filed against the driver, even though evidence suggested a failure to yield. Days earlier, Monica Chen, a pedestrian, was killed by a turning driver in Bay Ridge. Again, no charges. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and City Council Member Justin Brannan expressed outrage, stating, "We are both outraged that the epidemic of traffic violence continues and as a result, a 67 year old woman is dead." They pledged to press the Department of Transportation for more safety measures. The NYPD declined comment. The Bronx faces a surge in road deaths. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to amend city law to 'restrict the use of bus lanes by sight-seeing buses.' It would have prohibited sightseeing buses from using bus lanes between 7–10 a.m. and 4–7 p.m. on weekdays. The Department of Transportation would also be barred from authorizing sightseeing bus stops in bus lanes during those hours.
