The pedestrian was emerging from in front of or behind a parked vehicle when the collision happened. The point of impact was the sedan’s right front bumper. The pedestrian sustained a fracture and dislocation to his elbow, lower arm, and hand, classified as injury severity level 3. The report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor, repeated twice, indicating the driver failed to maintain proper attention. There are no contributing factors listed for the pedestrian. This crash highlights the dangers posed by distracted driving in urban settings, especially where pedestrians enter traffic from behind parked vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Lower speed limits. Rights for crash victims. Safe passing for cyclists. Complete streets. City demands action as deaths rise. Streets remain deadly. Lawmakers must act.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0090-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 28, 2024, it calls on the state to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law') and A.1901, part of the SAFE Streets Act. The matter title: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422... allowing New York city to establish a lower speed limit, and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif leads, joined by Gutiérrez, Hudson, Nurse, and others. The resolution demands lower speed limits, crash victim rights, safe passing for cyclists, and complete street design. It cites rising traffic deaths and the failure of current measures. The Council wants Albany to give the city real power to protect people on its streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
