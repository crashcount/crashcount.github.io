Three more are left with serious injuries. <strong>One child did not make it home.</strong> In the last year alone, 187 people were hurt in 373 crashes. One was killed. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty chairs, and families who will never be whole again. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and children pay first.</strong> In the last twelve months, 18 people under 18 were hurt. One died. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. Trucks and buses added to the toll. No one on a bike died, but that is luck, not safety. The street does not forgive. Review the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>collision records</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But in Coney Island-Sea Gate, the blood dries faster than the promises. <strong>Speed still kills.</strong> The council can lower the limit to 20 mph. They have not. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud. The clock ticks. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> It is policy. It is choice. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to keep the cameras on.

Enforcement aims to slow drivers and cut risk on vital routes.</p><p class=mb3>Patch reported on May 8, 2025, that New York lawmakers approved an expansion of a speed camera pilot program for MTA bridges and tunnels. The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031. The move targets driver speed, a key factor in crash severity, and signals a shift toward automated enforcement on major city crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year.

Her car struck a mother and two young children. All three died. The driver faced manslaughter charges. The street bore the weight of loss and metal.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (April 6, 2025) reports that Miriam Yarimi, driving with a suspended license for lapsed insurance, sped through a red light in Brooklyn on March 29. Her Audi struck a family, killing a mother and two small children. Police said Yarimi was 'reportedly speeding, ran a red light, and struck the family.' Prosecutors allege she told first responders she was possessed at the time. The article details Yarimi’s history as a victim of sexual abuse by a former NYPD officer, but the crash itself highlights systemic failures: a suspended license, unchecked speed, and a fatal intersection. The incident underscores persistent dangers for pedestrians and families on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
