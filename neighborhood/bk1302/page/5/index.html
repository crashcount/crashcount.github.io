Five seriously hurt.</strong> In Coney Island-Sea Gate, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have struck down children, elders, and cyclists. <strong>A child is dead. An elder is dead.</strong> The living carry wounds that do not heal. In the last year alone, 218 people were injured here. Three were hurt so badly they may never walk the same.</p><p>On June 22, a 26-year-old cyclist was hit by an SUV at Stillwell and Neptune. He left the scene with his head bleeding, the road marked with his pain. On May 7, an 88-year-old man was struck by a taxi while crossing at W 5th Street. He survived, but not without shock and blood loss. The driver was making a U-turn. The old man was crossing. The street did not forgive either of them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-voices-left-behind>The Voices Left Behind</h3><p><strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.
