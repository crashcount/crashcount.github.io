Three more are left with serious injuries. <strong>One child did not make it home.</strong> In the last year alone, 187 people were hurt in 373 crashes. One was killed. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty chairs, and families who will never be whole again. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and children pay first.</strong> In the last twelve months, 18 people under 18 were hurt. One died. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. Trucks and buses added to the toll. No one on a bike died, but that is luck, not safety. The street does not forgive. Review the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>collision records</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But in Coney Island-Sea Gate, the blood dries faster than the promises. <strong>Speed still kills.</strong> The council can lower the limit to 20 mph. They have not. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud. The clock ticks. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> It is policy. It is choice. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Tell them to build streets that protect the child, not the car. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The lane, installed in October, had reduced crashes, according to DOT data. Plaintiffs argued removal would increase danger and violated city rules on public notice. The city’s lawyers dismissed its own safety data, claiming it was unreliable. Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives warned, “Mayor Adams is exposing the City of New York...to significant financial and legal liability.” Attorney Peter Beadle urged Adams to let DOT implement safer alternatives.

The move follows a court ruling allowing the change. City Hall claims the redesign addresses 'serious safety concerns.' Legal precedent (Turturro v.
