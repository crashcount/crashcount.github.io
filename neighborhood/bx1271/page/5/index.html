The pain is steady, unbroken, silent.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-metal-against-flesh>The Pattern: Metal Against Flesh</h3><p>Cars and SUVs dominate the carnage. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds—they all play their part. A truck hit a pedestrian on Webster Avenue. A moped rider was thrown from his seat. A cyclist was struck by an SUV turning left. The stories repeat. The names change. The outcome does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city has the power to slow the bloodshed.

Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. The city can lower the speed limit. The state can keep cameras running.

Assembly Member Dinowitz and Senator Gounardes push for more cameras. DOT data shows fewer violations and crashes. Advocates demand action. The cap leaves neighborhoods exposed. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Bills A5259 and S2812 face debate in the New York State legislature. If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action. Vulnerable road users face risk if the program lapses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, which would grant New York City local control over its speed limits, remains stalled in the Assembly. The rally, led by Families for Safe Streets, called out lawmakers for refusing to bring the measure to a vote. Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry. The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Belmont and Fordham Business Improvement Districts, along with the Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Garden, Fordham University, Monroe College, and St. Barnabas Hospital, argue the changes would 'significantly impact crucial traffic flow' and burden side streets. State Sen. Gustavo Rivera voiced support for transit equity but awaits a traffic study. DOT claims to work with the community.

Rivera paid the price.</p><p class=mb3>On December 31, 2022, Edwin Rivera was struck and killed by a pick-up truck driver at Broadway and W. 238th Street in Council District 11. The driver fled. The intersection sits in Councilmember Eric Dinowitz’s district. Dinowitz recently opposed a proposal to make Riverdale Avenue safer. The article states, 'Council District 11, which is represented by Eric Dinowitz, who recently opposed an effort to make Riverdale Avenue in his district safer.' The Department of Transportation installed safety measures north of Van Cortlandt Park, but not at the site of Rivera’s death. In 2022, Dinowitz’s district saw 1,659 reported crashes, injuring 135 pedestrians and 27 cyclists. The city’s inaction left a deadly gap. Rivera is the latest victim.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
