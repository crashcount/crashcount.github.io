The letter stated, 'While the MTA carries 43 percent of the nation's mass transit riders, its share of federal transit formula funding is only 17 percent.' In response, President Trump’s transportation chief, Sean Duffy, condemned the request, calling the MTA 'horribly run' and blaming New York’s financial mismanagement. Duffy insisted the federal government would not provide a 'blank check' and demanded a plan to make the subway 'reliable, secure, and clean' before any funding changes.

The letter urges, 'Mass transit must be federally funded at a level commensurate to its importance.' Stewart-Cousins, mentioned as a key signatory, previously rejected the capital plan due to a $35 billion shortfall. The group asks for $14 billion in federal support, up from $13 billion in the last plan. The MTA warns that without this funding, critical infrastructure—power, signaling, accessibility—remains at risk. The request is urgent.

The clock ticks.</p><p class=mb3>On March 21, 2025, the Citizens Budget Commission (CBC) released a warning about the MTA’s $33.4-billion capital budget gap for 2025–2029. The CBC recommends slashing $17 billion, scrapping expansion plans like the Interborough Express, and boosting city and state contributions by $9 billion. The CBC calls for a 6 percent hike in fares, tolls, and vehicle fees—higher than the planned 4 percent. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said tax hikes are on the table. Governor Hochul’s office backs a payroll tax hike, but the CBC wants it regionalized. The CBC’s Andrew Rein said, “We have to prioritize state-of-good-repair, basic modernization, and delay some of the system expansions.” The report warns that failing to fund maintenance will gut service, repeating past crises.

The measure aims to close a $35 billion hole in the MTA’s five-year capital plan, which covers subway and bus upgrades. The bill has no number yet and remains under negotiation. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, 'The discussion on revenue raisers is definitely going to have to be a part of the MTA.' Senator Steve Chan, District 17, criticized the tax hike, calling it 'a slap on the Brooklyn businesses struggling for survival in my district.' The talks also floated surcharges on for-hire vehicles and online deliveries. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The budget deadline looms.

Assemblymember Steven Raga leads the push for a $35 million pilot, aiming to install 150 cameras targeting double parking and illegal stops. The bill, not yet assigned a committee or number, seeks to automate enforcement where manual efforts fall short. Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead. The Department of Transportation supports the expansion, stating, 'Automated enforcement has proven to change driver behavior and make our streets safer for everyone.' The debate centers on whether automation or police presence best protects pedestrians and cyclists from blocked lanes and traffic hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The $68-billion plan, approved by the MTA Board, has only $35 billion secured. State leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, rejected the plan’s funding gap, insisting it be resolved in the state budget. Lieber argued, 'the MTA capital budget is totally predictable... no different than Medicaid and education.' He called for the state to treat transit infrastructure as a core, recurring expense. Advocates like Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany echoed this, demanding the state guarantee timely payments and accountability. Governor Hochul and legislative leaders voiced support but offered no concrete solutions. The debate leaves the city’s transit riders waiting for action and exposes them to the risks of delayed repairs and unreliable service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hochul dodged the $35 billion hole in the MTA’s capital plan. She told the MTA to revise and resubmit. Riders wait. Lawmakers point fingers. The city and state offer less than promised. The gap grows. Transit hangs in limbo.</p><p class=mb3>On January 22, 2025, Governor Kathy Hochul announced the state’s budget approach, sidestepping the $33–$35 billion shortfall in the MTA capital plan. The plan, previously vetoed by Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, now faces deeper uncertainty. Hochul’s budget proposes $3 billion each from the state and city, less than the $4 billion the MTA expected. Hochul stated, "The MTA is developing an updated capital plan to propose to me and the legislature, and once we receive it, we will determine the best way to fund it." Advocates, including Reinvent Albany, called this an abdication of responsibility, warning it puts millions of transit riders at risk. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the funding gap threatens the system they rely on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
