State Comptroller DiNapoli warns of stalled upgrades, crumbling service, and years of pain for riders. Transit faces deep cuts. Streets stay clogged. Safety and air suffer.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2024, State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli issued a report blasting Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause on congestion pricing. The program, set to charge drivers $15 to enter Manhattan’s core, was expected to raise $15 billion for the MTA’s $55-billion capital plan. DiNapoli’s report, titled 'Loss of Congestion Pricing Revenue Leaves MTA With No Good Options,' warns that the MTA 'will be forced to put off badly needed investment in expansion and improvements to the system.' He stressed, 'Those choices will directly affect riders ... for years to come.' NYC Comptroller Brad Lander echoed support for congestion pricing, urging the governor to reconsider price points if it means moving forward. Activists plan to pressure the MTA board to resist the governor’s decision, citing the need to avoid transit cuts and deliver 'major traffic safety, air quality, and cost of living improvements for all New Yorkers.' The loss of funding threatens basic maintenance, reliability, and frequency, with no clear replacement in sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Power Outage: Schumer, Heastie Won’t Fight Hochul’s Congestion Pricing ‘Pause’,' highlights both leaders’ support for congestion pricing and MTA funding, but neither will challenge the Governor’s decision. Heastie said, 'If you want me to attack the Governor for making a call, I’m sorry I’m not going to do that. I want to get the MTA funded.' Schumer, pressed by a constituent, affirmed his support but refused to publicly pressure Hochul, claiming she 'doesn’t react well to public pressure.' With the MTA board’s plan stalled and federal action pending, the program’s future is uncertain.

The bill or action, discussed in committee and at press conferences by Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, left the MTA warning of capital cuts. The matter summary states, 'Modernization and improvement projects like electric buses, accessible stations and new signals will likely need to be deprioritized.' Hochul defended her decision, claiming to protect working-class New Yorkers, but advocates and reporters questioned her reversal. With no new funding, critical upgrades for transit safety and accessibility are at risk, leaving vulnerable road users exposed as state leaders fail to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers for all outside a car.</p><p class=mb3>"If congestion pricing at this moment is not going to be what funds it, you have to raise revenue." -- Carl Heastie</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, New York’s legislature ended its session without plugging the MTA’s multi-billion-dollar budget hole. The gap opened when Governor Hochul halted Manhattan’s congestion pricing. The bill, discussed but not passed, would have replaced lost revenue—$1 billion a year meant for transit upgrades. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, mentioned in the debate, said, 'Our conference is reticent to commit a billion dollars annually for the next 15 years without having some understanding in place as to how we're going to deal with congestion as well.' Lawmakers could not agree on new taxes or a legislative IOU. The inaction leaves critical MTA projects—like electric buses and accessible stations—at risk. Vulnerable road users lose most: less transit means more cars, more danger, and fewer safe options for those on foot, bike, or bus.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced June 6, 2024, it urges the State Legislature to let cities raise the cap on commercial overnight parking fines. The matter title reads: "Resolution calling on the State legislature to increase the cap on commercial overnight fines for cities." Council Members Eric Dinowitz (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, and Robert F. Holden back the measure. They argue that capped fines are too low—companies absorb them, streets clog with trucks, and residents pay the price. The Council wants authority to set fines that actually deter illegal parking. The resolution points to nearly 27,000 complaints in 2021 and notes that current enforcement tools are weak.

The bill would shift funds from highways to transit, biking, and walking. Electeds from Brooklyn to Buffalo back the move. Streets could change. Fewer cars. More space for people. Lives at stake.</p><p class=mb3>Bill A4120/S1981 aims to cut vehicle miles traveled in New York by 20% by 2050. On May 15, 2024, more than a dozen local officials sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, urging passage before session’s end in June. The letter, organized by Local Progress, states: 'This means projects that expanded cycling infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, and public transit were prioritized over outdated highway expansions and lane widening.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill. Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.' The bill would force planners to consider car miles in every project, shifting focus from car movement to safer, people-first streets. The policy could help undo decades of harm from highways that split communities and reinforce segregation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
