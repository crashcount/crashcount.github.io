Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car."

Hochul, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins all voiced support but offered no funding solutions. Hochul rejected raising personal taxes and delayed the cap-and-invest program. Heastie pinned hopes on federal aid, while Stewart-Cousins admitted, 'we didn't have an answer.'

Lawmakers consider exemptions or repeals to congestion pricing, undermining the MTA’s financial foundation. Andrew Rein, a key voice, warns that withholding funds is 'a recipe for disaster and an abdication of responsibility.'

Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins blocked approval, citing incomplete funding. The plan, described as funding 'crucial state-of-good-repair track work,' now hangs in limbo. MTA CEO Janno Lieber called the move a 'Catch-22' that could cause cascading failures and delay urgent repairs. The Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA urged lawmakers to withdraw their objection, warning of long-term delays and higher costs. Stewart-Cousins’s spokesperson, Mike Murphy, dismissed the urgency, pointing to unfinished projects from the last plan. The standoff leaves essential transit upgrades—and the safety of millions—at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move followed public outrage over Gov. Hochul’s congestion pricing scheme and a planned 4% fare hike for transit riders. The editorial, titled 'Gov. Hochul is the face of the MTA’s congestion-toll madness: Don’t let her fool you,' blasted the $9 toll and warned that the agency’s legal power to raise prices remains. Stewart-Cousins and Heastie’s last-minute action signals deeper political games, not reform. The article quotes Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli: 'Consolidation, efficiency, and savings in this area was promised years ago, but has yet to be fully realized.' No safety analyst weighed in, but the capital plan’s collapse means no new investment in safer streets or transit. Vulnerable road users remain at risk. The system’s failures continue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA Board had approved the plan 10-0 on September 25 and submitted it to the Capital Plan Review Board (CPRB) on October 1. The matter, described as 'the MTA's $68 billion budget to fix mass transit,' was rejected by Stewart-Cousins and Heastie with a letter sent on Christmas Eve. Their action blocks dozens of projects, including subway accessibility, station repairs, and new transit lines like the Interborough Express. The veto leaves the future of these upgrades—and the safety of millions of riders—uncertain. The MTA warns this could threaten federal funding and delay critical improvements. The city’s transit system, already battered by delays and breakdowns, now faces more risk and instability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, as described, funds 'essential work'—new trains, accessibility, power, and station repairs. Riders Alliance called on Albany to 'fix the subway.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance warned, 'the least-visible projects are the most vulnerable to cuts – but also often the most essential, like new signals and upgrades to power systems and structures.' Neither Heastie nor Stewart-Cousins responded to requests for comment. The rejection delays contract awards for new electric rail cars and locomotives, leaving millions of riders—and vulnerable road users—at risk from crumbling infrastructure and unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
