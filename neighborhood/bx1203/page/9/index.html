The left front bumper folded. The driver suffered a severe leg laceration. Unsafe speed and lane changing caused the crash, leaving multiple passengers injured.</p><p class=mb3>A 2011 Hyundai sedan crashed near 500 Abbot Street in the Bronx at 21:11, carrying five occupants. According to the police report, the vehicle was 'making right turn' and 'turned too fast,' causing the left front bumper to fold on impact. The 27-year-old male driver sustained a severe leg laceration but remained conscious. Four passengers, ages 17 to 26, were also injured, suffering abrasions, fractures, and dislocations. All occupants were restrained with lap belts and harnesses and were not ejected. The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Unsafe Lane Changing' as contributing factors. The narrative emphasizes the driver's excessive speed and erratic lane change as the cause of the crash. No other road users or victim behaviors were noted as contributing factors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way. The bill targets that risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Twenty-nine dead last year. Highest ever. Reckless drivers surge post-pandemic. City report demands more cameras—jump from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Officials back the bill. Victims’ families demand action. Cameras cut crashes. But the most dangerous drivers remain loose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2024, the Department of Transportation released a report urging passage of a bill to expand New York City’s red-light camera program. The bill, supported by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and sponsored by State Senator Andrew Goundardes, would boost camera coverage from 150 to 1,325 intersections—about 10% of the city’s 13,700 signals. The report states: “Expanding the number of intersections with red light cameras... could substantially enhance the deterrent effect of the program and return New York City to the consistently downward trend of red light-running behavior we had seen prior to the pandemic.” Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz also supports expansion, calling for cameras at every intersection. The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains. Relatives of crash victims joined the call, demanding the city confront driver negligence and protect the community.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Grief and anger mount.</p><p class=mb3>On March 13, 2024, the New York State Assembly declined to advance Sammy’s Law (no bill number cited), which would let New York City set its own speed limit. The measure was left out of the Assembly’s budget, despite support from the State Senate, Governor Hochul, Mayor Adams, and the City Council. The bill’s sponsor, Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal, did not comment. The Assembly’s move angered advocates and families, including Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets, who said, 'We are very disappointed that the Assembly didn’t follow suit.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called the decision a failure to join 'more than 130 unions, hospitals, business leaders, and community-led organizations that recognize the urgent need for this common-sense legislation.' The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. A rally is planned to push for the bill’s passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill demands weather-proof shelters and storage, aiming to meet the city’s cycling surge. Lawmakers want fewer cars, more bikes, and safer streets for all.</p><p class=mb3>On February 29, 2024, Council Member Chris Marte introduced a bill in the New York City Council requiring covered bike parking in parks and city-owned buildings. The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Eric Dinowitz, is under committee review. The legislation states, 'the city would have to install between one and five weather-proof enclosures with six to eight spaces apiece, depending on the size of the park.' Parks over 2.5 acres must have at least one shelter; parks over 250 acres need five. City buildings over 10,000 square feet, including public schools, must provide bike storage for workers and visitors. Marte said, 'If we want to get off the reliance of people commuting by car, we have to offer them alternative ways to get there.' The Parks Department and city agencies must report on implementation or explain impracticality. This bill targets safer, more accessible bike infrastructure for New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They condemned the use of Outer Borough Transit Account (OBTA) funds for toll rebates instead of transit improvements. The OBTA, created in 2018 from a surcharge on Manhattan taxi and for-hire rides, was meant to boost transit service or lower fares outside Manhattan. Yet, $22.2 million has gone to toll rebates for drivers in the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. Only one transit project—the Far Rockaway City Ticket—has seen funding. Riders Alliance Director Danny Pearlstein said, “The Outer Borough Transit Account should clearly also help the millions of people outside Manhattan who don't have cars and who depend on public transit.” Lawmakers have not responded.

Sponsored by Timothy M. Kennedy with support from Jake Ashby, Jamaal Bailey, and others, the bill mandates street designs that protect everyone—not just drivers. The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The bill marks a shift away from car-first planning, forcing cities to build streets for people, not just traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Bills A5259 and S2812 face debate in the New York State legislature. If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action. Vulnerable road users face risk if the program lapses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
