Police say a 21‑year‑old tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck two bikes. Both riders were thrown and died at hospitals. The driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, then released without bail while the case moves ahead, according to family and court coverage. “He was drunk. Think about how he took two lives,” a sister said. “How could they let him go?” said a mother. The defense lawyer said, “My client is prepared to contest these charges.”</p><ul><li>Read the initial police account and charges in the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/11/bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>Daily News</a>, follow‑up family quotes in the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Daily News</a>, and the charge details in <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>.
