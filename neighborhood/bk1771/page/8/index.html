A driver turns right. The man goes down. In Holy Cross Cemetery and the blocks around it, this is not rare. It is routine. <strong>Five people injured in five crashes in the last year.</strong> None died. But the numbers do not show the limp, the hospital bills, the fear that lingers at the curb.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, adults, the old. In the last twelve months, injuries struck every age: a teenager, a man in his thirties, a woman in her forties. No one was killed. But the luck will not hold. The street does not care.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the damage.</strong> In this patch of Brooklyn, they are the only ones to injure pedestrians. No bikes. No motorcycles. Just steel and glass, moving too fast, turning too quick. The data is plain: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>sedans, vans, SUVs</a> are the weapons. The people on foot are the targets.</p><h3 id=the-silence-of-power>The Silence of Power</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passes laws. But here, in Holy Cross Cemetery, the blood dries and the leaders stay quiet. <strong>No bold redesigns. No new protections.</strong> The numbers tick up, the bodies mend or do not. The crisis moves slow, but it moves. Each crash is a warning. Each injury is a failure.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crosswalks can be rebuilt. But only if leaders act. Only if neighbors demand it. The cost of waiting is counted in broken bones and lost days.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand slower speeds, safer crossings, and streets that do not maim.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill is currently a legislative proposal. Parker argues, 'we need an NYPD residency requirement, which the force had until 1962.' He highlights that over half of NYPD officers now live outside the city, undermining trust and accountability. Parker’s record includes laws on police misconduct, body cameras, and transparency. He cites a 2021 DePaul University study showing residency brings faster response times, better complaint handling, more diversity, and stronger community ties. Mayor Adams called the proposal 'a smart idea.' Parker urges Albany to act, stressing that most city civil servants already live in the five boroughs. He pledges to work on affordable housing for officers.

Sixty days’ notice. Four weeks for comments. Two weeks for answers. Streets can’t shift without neighbors knowing. The bill died at session’s end. Streets stay uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0172-2022, filed by the NYC Council and handled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, aimed to amend city law on open streets. Introduced April 14, 2022, the bill required the Department of Transportation to give 60 days’ notice to council members, boards, and local groups before any permanent open street changes. The bill’s summary reads: “notification and community input regarding designation of, removal of and changes to open streets.” Sponsors included Tiffany Cabán (primary), Crystal Hudson, Kamillah Hanks, Oswald Feliz, Farah N. Louis, Kalman Yeger, Sandy Nurse, Shahana K. Hanif, and Althea V. Stevens. The bill mandated a four-week comment window and a two-week response period, plus annual reporting and advance notice for temporary changes. The bill was filed at the end of session, leaving open streets policy unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They want special permits to drop parking. They say parking rules drive up costs, block affordable homes, and fuel car use. The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
