A driver turns right. The man goes down. In Holy Cross Cemetery and the blocks around it, this is not rare. It is routine. <strong>Five people injured in five crashes in the last year.</strong> None died. But the numbers do not show the limp, the hospital bills, the fear that lingers at the curb.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, adults, the old. In the last twelve months, injuries struck every age: a teenager, a man in his thirties, a woman in her forties. No one was killed. But the luck will not hold. The street does not care.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the damage.</strong> In this patch of Brooklyn, they are the only ones to injure pedestrians. No bikes. No motorcycles. Just steel and glass, moving too fast, turning too quick. The data is plain: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>sedans, vans, SUVs</a> are the weapons. The people on foot are the targets.</p><h3 id=the-silence-of-power>The Silence of Power</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passes laws. But here, in Holy Cross Cemetery, the blood dries and the leaders stay quiet. <strong>No bold redesigns. No new protections.</strong> The numbers tick up, the bodies mend or do not. The crisis moves slow, but it moves. Each crash is a warning. Each injury is a failure.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crosswalks can be rebuilt. But only if leaders act. Only if neighbors demand it. The cost of waiting is counted in broken bones and lost days.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand slower speeds, safer crossings, and streets that do not maim.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Audi's driver, Miriam Yarimi, 32, was arrested and charged with manslaughter. Police said she was driving on a suspended license.
