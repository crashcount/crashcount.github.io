A driver turns right. The man goes down. In Holy Cross Cemetery and the blocks around it, this is not rare. It is routine. <strong>Five people injured in five crashes in the last year.</strong> None died. But the numbers do not show the limp, the hospital bills, the fear that lingers at the curb.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, adults, the old. In the last twelve months, injuries struck every age: a teenager, a man in his thirties, a woman in her forties. No one was killed. But the luck will not hold. The street does not care.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the damage.</strong> In this patch of Brooklyn, they are the only ones to injure pedestrians. No bikes. No motorcycles. Just steel and glass, moving too fast, turning too quick. The data is plain: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>sedans, vans, SUVs</a> are the weapons. The people on foot are the targets.</p><h3 id=the-silence-of-power>The Silence of Power</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passes laws. But here, in Holy Cross Cemetery, the blood dries and the leaders stay quiet. <strong>No bold redesigns. No new protections.</strong> The numbers tick up, the bodies mend or do not. The crisis moves slow, but it moves. Each crash is a warning. Each injury is a failure.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crosswalks can be rebuilt. But only if leaders act. Only if neighbors demand it. The cost of waiting is counted in broken bones and lost days.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand slower speeds, safer crossings, and streets that do not maim.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill targets drivers hiding their plates from red light and speed cameras. Reports must show where, when, and how plates go unseen. Data goes public, every quarter.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0712-2022, now enacted as Local Law 155 of 2023, passed the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the full Council on October 19, 2023. The law, sponsored by Gale A. Brewer with co-sponsors including Erik D. Bottcher, Lincoln Restler, and others, amends the city code to require the Department of Transportation to report on vehicles with license plates unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems. The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The reports must be public and sent to the Mayor and Council Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C. Riley (primary), with Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Hanif, Brewer, Restler, and Rivera as co-sponsors, the bill demands DOT report, by neighborhood, on safety infrastructure investment, crash rates, and demographics. It shines a light on which districts get safety upgrades and which are left exposed.

The law was introduced on October 27, 2022, passed on May 29, 2023, and returned unsigned by the mayor. The bill amends the administrative code to require the Department of Transportation to conduct a comprehensive study of all pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries every three years, instead of every five. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian safety reporting.' Sponsors include Alexa Avilés (primary), Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Crystal Hudson, Amanda Farías, Tiffany Cabán, Lynn C. Schulman, Kalman Yeger, Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, Darlene Mealy, Eric Dinowitz, Linda Lee, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Carlina Rivera, Mercedes Narcisse, and Rita C. Joseph. The law mandates that crash reports and recommendations be sent to council members, community boards, and made public. This change increases transparency and keeps the focus on the deadly toll of cars in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight for safer streets continues.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 417, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, was discussed at a City Council hearing on April 26, 2023. The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the Council, 'We love Lincoln Restler's bill,' and called the old law 'unnecessarily burdensome.' The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster. Bike advocates and DOT say the change is vital to meet safety targets and reduce cyclist injuries, which drop by over 30 percent where bike lanes are built.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
