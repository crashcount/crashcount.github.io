A driver turns right. The man goes down. In Holy Cross Cemetery and the blocks around it, this is not rare. It is routine. <strong>Five people injured in five crashes in the last year.</strong> None died. But the numbers do not show the limp, the hospital bills, the fear that lingers at the curb.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, adults, the old. In the last twelve months, injuries struck every age: a teenager, a man in his thirties, a woman in her forties. No one was killed. But the luck will not hold. The street does not care.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the damage.</strong> In this patch of Brooklyn, they are the only ones to injure pedestrians. No bikes. No motorcycles. Just steel and glass, moving too fast, turning too quick. The data is plain: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>sedans, vans, SUVs</a> are the weapons. The people on foot are the targets.</p><h3 id=the-silence-of-power>The Silence of Power</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passes laws. But here, in Holy Cross Cemetery, the blood dries and the leaders stay quiet. <strong>No bold redesigns. No new protections.</strong> The numbers tick up, the bodies mend or do not. The crisis moves slow, but it moves. Each crash is a warning. Each injury is a failure.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crosswalks can be rebuilt. But only if leaders act. Only if neighbors demand it. The cost of waiting is counted in broken bones and lost days.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand slower speeds, safer crossings, and streets that do not maim.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the Council, 'We love Lincoln Restler's bill,' and called the old law 'unnecessarily burdensome.' The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster. Bike advocates and DOT say the change is vital to meet safety targets and reduce cyclist injuries, which drop by over 30 percent where bike lanes are built.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
