Six more suffered injuries so grave they were marked as serious. <strong>768 people have been hurt</strong>—bodies broken, lives changed. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry the story in scars and limps. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-of-harm>The Pattern of Harm</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, and riders of small vehicles pay the highest price.</strong> Trucks and SUVs strike hardest. In one crash, a 75-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal, hit by a turning pickup truck. A cyclist crushed by a box truck. A moped rider thrown and left bleeding. The pattern repeats. The names change. The pain does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p><strong>City leaders have the power to act.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the right to lower speed limits. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But in Maspeth, the pace of change is slow. No record of bold action from local officials. No public push for safer crossings or protected bike lanes. <strong>The silence is its own answer.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren, the next family shattered. The tools exist: lower speed limits, redesign dangerous intersections, enforce the laws that save lives. <strong>But tools unused are as useless as promises unkept.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets. Do not wait for another obituary.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Holden (District 30) condemned the longstanding exemption shielding Governor Hochul’s state-owned SUVs from traffic camera enforcement. The matter, reported as 'Gov. Hochul’s SUVs are cloaked from traffic cameras,' reveals that these vehicles, used by Hochul and Lt. Governor Delgado, cannot be flagged by speed or red-light cameras—a security measure in place for fifty years. Holden called the exemption 'disgusting and disturbing,' highlighting the hypocrisy as Hochul champions camera expansion and congestion pricing for the public. The city’s Department of Transportation and other officials were unaware of the loophole. In contrast, Mayor Adams’ NYPD detail faces camera enforcement. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure and other critics demand accountability for all officials. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the lack of enforcement leaves vulnerable road users at risk while officials evade consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

Holden said, “He’s the last person who should be advocating for more bike lanes, having been caught blocking one.” Despite the criticism, Levine continues to promote street redesigns and enforcement, aiming to convert a section of the West Side Highway into a bike lane and favor non-car owners in community board appointments. Levine’s spokesman stated that all tickets were paid promptly and steps have been taken to prevent future infractions. Street-safety groups back Levine’s agenda, which centers on protecting vulnerable road users by reducing car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident, which killed 74-year-old Be Tran at Myrtle and Seneca Avenues, triggered public outcry. Gianaris criticized the city’s process, saying, 'They have to wait until that happens to get the score high enough to realize that an intersection needs protection.' He joined activists from the Ridgewood Tenants Union and Transportation Alternatives, demanding new signals and better street design. Gianaris said he contacted the Department of Transportation a year earlier with no result. The city claims over 20 traffic control approvals in Ridgewood, but residents and advocates say it’s not enough. The call comes as pedestrian deaths and injuries continue to climb citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Ardila backs safer streets, mass transit, and bike lanes. Critics see hypocrisy. StreetsPac still endorses Ardila. The clash exposes tension between personal conduct and public pledges.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2022, Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30) publicly criticized Juan Ardila, candidate for the 37th Assembly District, over more than two dozen traffic and parking violations since 2019. The controversy centers on Ardila’s support for the Green New Deal, mass transit, expanded bike lanes, and reducing car culture—policies he has championed in public forums. Holden accused Ardila of hypocrisy, highlighting the gap between Ardila’s driving record and his policy positions. Despite this, StreetsPac, a safe streets advocacy group, endorsed Ardila, noting his support for 24/7 speed cameras and safer biking infrastructure. Ardila stated, 'We need to ensure that every New Yorker has the opportunity to bike and... reduce car culture within our communities.' The episode underscores the scrutiny faced by candidates who pledge to protect vulnerable road users while their personal actions draw criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
