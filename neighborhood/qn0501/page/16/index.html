Six more suffered injuries so grave they were marked as serious. <strong>768 people have been hurt</strong>—bodies broken, lives changed. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry the story in scars and limps. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-of-harm>The Pattern of Harm</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, and riders of small vehicles pay the highest price.</strong> Trucks and SUVs strike hardest. In one crash, a 75-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal, hit by a turning pickup truck. A cyclist crushed by a box truck. A moped rider thrown and left bleeding. The pattern repeats. The names change. The pain does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p><strong>City leaders have the power to act.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the right to lower speed limits. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But in Maspeth, the pace of change is slow. No record of bold action from local officials. No public push for safer crossings or protected bike lanes. <strong>The silence is its own answer.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren, the next family shattered. The tools exist: lower speed limits, redesign dangerous intersections, enforce the laws that save lives. <strong>But tools unused are as useless as promises unkept.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets. Do not wait for another obituary.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The legislation was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. With enforcement paused, bus lanes would have lost their shield. Riders and pedestrians would face more cars in bus lanes, more chaos, and less safety when streets are busiest.
