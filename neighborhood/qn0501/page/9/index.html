Trucks and buses are tied to pedestrian harm: 2 of the pedestrian deaths involved trucks, per the rollup (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The listed causes are blunt. Failure to yield. Improper passing. Inattention. Unsafe speed shows up too. “Other” is the largest bucket in the city’s coding, which hides more than it tells, but the bodies are real (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-could-change-on-these-blocks>What could change on these blocks</h3><p>Start with turns. Harden the right turns on Fresh Pond Road and Grand Avenue. Give walkers a head start with LPIs. Clear sightlines with daylighting. These basics answer the failure‑to‑yield pattern the data shows on local corners (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Cut truck risk. Target truck routes to keep the biggest vehicles off neighborhood streets. Enforce yielding at Maurice and Fresh Pond during peak injury hours. The dataset’s “trucks/buses” share in pedestrian harm makes the case (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=accountability-that-sticks>Accountability that sticks</h3><p>Obscured plates block cameras and block justice. A new Council bill would revoke city permits for drivers caught with covered or defaced plates. Council Member Robert Holden is listed as a sponsor on <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1358‑2025</a>. The bill says it aims at “revocation of city‑issued parking permits” for “obscured or defaced license plates” (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>).</p><p>Repeat speeders do outsized harm citywide. Albany is moving a bill to force speed‑limiting tech on drivers who rack up violations. State Sen. Michael Gianaris voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>, which would require intelligent speed assistance for repeat offenders, per the bill summary and vote logs (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</p><h3 id=slower-streets-save-lives>Slower streets save lives</h3><p>The worst damage in Maspeth piles up at truck routes and fast corridors like the LIE, Maurice, Fresh Pond, and Grand. The fixes are simple and known: slower turns, clear corners, real truck management, speed kept in check. Citywide, lower default speeds and stopping repeat speeders will reach every block here.

The crash occurred as both vehicles traveled south. The report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error in the moments before impact. The motorcycle’s operator was unlicensed and, as noted in the report, wore no helmet at the time of the crash. The rider suffered a severe arm injury, with the narrative stating his arm 'split open on impact' and 'blood pooled on the pavement.' The police report makes no mention of any contributing victim behavior beyond the lack of helmet use, which is noted only after the cited driver error.

The protest, organized by Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives, took place under the 7 train. Jaqi Cohen of Tri-State Transportation Campaign declared, “She can't ignore the needs of New York's eight million transit riders.” Restaurant owner Michael Fuquay said, “You want to know how my employees get to work? They walk, they bike, they take the bus.” State Assembly candidate Claire Valdez called the move “a slap in the face to millions who use public transit.” The MTA’s capital plan, including long-awaited elevator upgrades at 46 St-Bliss St and 33 St-Rawson, now hangs in the balance. Protesters condemned the governor’s action as a blow to vulnerable New Yorkers who depend on safe, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Legislature rejected Hochul’s push for a payroll tax hike, then considered a vague $1 billion IOU for the MTA, with no funding source. Gianaris told reporters the proposal would simply promise a billion dollars for the next year’s budget, but offered no details. The bill has not been introduced or assigned to committee. Betsy Plum of the Riders Alliance warned, 'The proposal on the table will not fix the subway. A billion dollar IOU is not nearly enough money nor is it nearly secure enough to build trust and rebuild our critical infrastructure.' With no new revenue, the MTA’s ability to fund repairs and upgrades remains in doubt. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders—face continued danger as safe, reliable alternatives to driving are left unfunded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'
