Six more suffered injuries so grave they were marked as serious. <strong>768 people have been hurt</strong>—bodies broken, lives changed. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry the story in scars and limps. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-of-harm>The Pattern of Harm</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, and riders of small vehicles pay the highest price.</strong> Trucks and SUVs strike hardest. In one crash, a 75-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal, hit by a turning pickup truck. A cyclist crushed by a box truck. A moped rider thrown and left bleeding. The pattern repeats. The names change. The pain does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p><strong>City leaders have the power to act.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the right to lower speed limits. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But in Maspeth, the pace of change is slow. No record of bold action from local officials. No public push for safer crossings or protected bike lanes. <strong>The silence is its own answer.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren, the next family shattered. The tools exist: lower speed limits, redesign dangerous intersections, enforce the laws that save lives. <strong>But tools unused are as useless as promises unkept.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets. Do not wait for another obituary.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The $15 toll, set to hit drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street, became a political weapon. State Sen. Michael Gianaris, mentioned in the debate, dismissed Republican attacks as ineffective. The measure, approved in 2019 by Democrats, aims to raise $1 billion for mass transit and reduce traffic. GOP figures like Nicole Malliotakis and Michael Lawler call it a 'burdensome tax' and 'outrageous cash grab.' Mayor Eric Adams seeks exemptions for medical trips. The bill’s matter title frames it as a major election issue: 'NY GOP eager to pin $15 congestion tax on Democrats in 2024 elections.' No safety analyst has assessed its impact on vulnerable road users.

The bill, before the Transportation Committee, would require licensing and visible plates for all e-bikes, scooters, and legal motorized vehicles not already registered with the DMV. The board opposed the measure, passing a resolution 21-15 (with five abstentions), calling it 'overly broad and ineffective at addressing safety concerns.' The matter summary reads: 'Require registration and licensing for all e-bikes and legal motorized vehicles.' Board members Brian Van Nieuwenhoven and Jason Froimowitz criticized the bill as incomplete and unrealistic, noting it would not solve dangerous operation or enforcement issues. Holden dismissed the board’s opposition as unrepresentative.

The event, covered on September 18, 2023, drew over 200 residents and was organized by Western Queens elected officials. The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal. No formal bill number or committee was cited; the event focused on immediate community engagement and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
