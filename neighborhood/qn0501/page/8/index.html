The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But in Maspeth, the pace of change is slow. No record of bold action from local officials. No public push for safer crossings or protected bike lanes. <strong>The silence is its own answer.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren, the next family shattered. The tools exist: lower speed limits, redesign dangerous intersections, enforce the laws that save lives. <strong>But tools unused are as useless as promises unkept.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member.

The narrative states the cyclist was thrown, crushed, and killed, suffering head trauma. The police report notes the truck 'kept straight' as it struck the cyclist, who lay still after impact. The contributing factor listed by police is 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion,' but no specific driver error is cited in the data. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, as recorded in the report, but this is not listed as a contributing factor to the crash.

Brooks-Powers (District 31), chair of the City Council’s Transportation Committee, came under fire after media reports revealed her family car received 25 traffic tickets in 16 months, including 20 for speeding near schools. The controversy centers on officials’ personal compliance with traffic laws while publicly supporting measures like speed cameras and congestion pricing. Brooks-Powers, who has promoted speed cameras and legislation to reward reporting hit-and-run drivers, claims her husband was responsible for the violations and that she has not used the car in over a year. Councilman Robert Holden called her a 'hypocrite,' while safe streets advocate Adam White stressed, 'Public officials and their families need to abide by speed cameras and red lights... people’s lives are at risk.' The incident highlights the gap between public safety advocacy and personal conduct, raising questions about accountability and public trust.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their proposal seeks $45 million in this year’s budget to boost bus frequency, with another $45 million to triple free buses citywide. The lawmakers’ push follows a successful fare-free pilot, which Mamdani says increased ridership by over 20%. Gianaris admitted, 'It should have been done sooner.' Critics argue the move is too late, as congestion pricing was approved in 2019. Some unions warn of possible driver shortages, but Mamdani insists existing buses and operators can handle the expansion. The funding proposal comes as the congestion toll faces lawsuits and could launch by mid-June.

Holden (District 30) joined a lawsuit challenging the MTA’s $15 congestion pricing policy. The legal action, filed by Lower East Side residents, business owners, and elected officials, claims the toll will create a traffic nightmare and worsen pollution by diverting cars to the FDR Drive. The suit argues the MTA and federal government failed to conduct an adequate environmental review and did not consider impacts on local businesses or vulnerable residents. The matter summary reads: 'Lower East Side residents sue MTA over $15 congestion toll, claiming it will create a traffic nightmare.' Holden’s involvement signals council opposition. The MTA maintains the program, approved in 2019, will cut congestion and fund transit upgrades.

Holden (District 30) published an op-ed opposing his own bill to require registration and licensing for e-bikes and e-scooters. The bill, introduced in the New York City Council, would impact the city’s 65,000 app-based delivery workers. The op-ed warns: 'What might sound benign at first would actually lead to a substantial increase in state surveillance and regulation of New York City's 65,000 app-based delivery workers.' Holden’s action—introducing the bill—has drawn sharp criticism for enabling more NYPD stops and fines, especially against Black, Latine, and immigrant riders. The piece details how similar enforcement has led to racial profiling and financial hardship for those least able to bear it. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the op-ed makes clear: more policing means more danger for the city’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30) supported raising fines for drivers using fake or obscured plates. The matter, reported by Gothamist, highlights a surge in 'ghost cars'—vehicles with covered, defaced, or phony plates—dodging tolls and speed cameras. Holden stated, "If somebody can save a lot of money by obscuring their plates, they'll do it." The NYPD has increased enforcement, but many offenders remain undeterred. Advocates and experts, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, warn that without strict enforcement, congestion pricing goals and street safety will suffer. The city has banned camera-blocking covers and encourages public reporting, but unresolved complaints and repeat violations persist. Holden's push aims to make penalties outweigh the savings from toll evasion, seeking legislative action to protect the program's integrity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
