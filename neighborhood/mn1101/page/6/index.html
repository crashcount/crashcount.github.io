The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project had paused after Hochul halted congestion pricing, leaving a $15 billion gap in the MTA’s budget. State Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Jeremy Cooney said, "I continue to believe this is an issue that can’t wait until next year’s session." The legislature ended its session without a plan to replace lost toll revenue. Hochul promised to address the shortfall in the 2025 budget. Assemblyman Eddie Gibbs praised Hochul’s commitment to East Harlem, while Rep. Adriano Espaillat thanked her for the funding. Critics warned the $54 million is a drop in the bucket. The MTA’s $70 billion capital plan hangs in the balance. No immediate relief for transit riders or vulnerable road users.
