The law orders the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections each year, up from 100. The city must also run outreach and education. The bill aims to keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike. No more hiding behind parked cars.

The taxi driver, a 59-year-old man, was injured with full-body trauma and was semiconscious upon arrival. He was restrained by a lap belt and complained of pain and nausea. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for the crash, specifically pointing to the bus driver. Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead when the bus struck the taxi's center back end with its center front end. The taxi driver was not ejected and was the sole occupant of his vehicle.
