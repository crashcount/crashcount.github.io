Eleven left with serious injuries.</strong> Eight hundred thirty-nine hurt since 2022. The dead include a child, an elderly woman, a cyclist, a pedestrian at a crosswalk. The living carry scars. The street does not care who you are. It takes the young and the old, the walker and the rider.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed. Motorcycles killed. Bikes killed.</strong> No one is spared. A sedan strikes a child. A moped hits an elderly woman at the intersection. A cyclist dies at the hands of a truck. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, and families left behind.</p><h3 id=the-leaders-and-their-words>The Leaders and Their Words</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk. The street keeps taking.</strong> In the last year, city officials have pointed to new laws and programs. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the pace is slow. The carnage is not.</p><p>&ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/cyclist-fell-hit-head-swerving-avoid-pedestrian-central-park-has-died/16785901/>said Police Commissioner Edward Caban</a>.

The injuries do not stop. <strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push.

The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to towing vehicles that are an encumbrance on the street.' It requires the Department of Sanitation to remove vehicles blocking the street within 72 hours of notice. The NYPD must tow cars with missing, obscured, or improper plates and stickers. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Salamanca, Brannan, Feliz, Ayala, Louis, Brewer, Avilés, Mealy, Ung, Restler, Farías, Hudson, Riley, and Schulman. The bill targets vehicles that endanger pedestrians and cyclists by blocking sightlines and crossings.
