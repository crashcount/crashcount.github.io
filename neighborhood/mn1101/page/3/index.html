A man was killed at the corner of 1st and 106th. An elderly woman was struck crossing 104th. In three and a half years, six people lost their lives to traffic violence in East Harlem (South). Eleven more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In the last twelve months, 272 people were injured, five of them seriously. Three did not survive. The dead include the old, the young, and those just trying to cross the street. The living carry scars and hospital bills.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs led the count.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left bodies behind. In the last three years, cars and trucks killed one, seriously injured one, and left forty-one with moderate wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, seriously injured one, and left twelve more hurt. Bikes killed one, seriously injured one, and left eleven with lesser injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Vehicle and person data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let them lower speed limits. They say speed cameras cut speeding by more than half. But the cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The law sits in limbo. The city could drop the speed limit to 20 mph today. It has not. Each day of delay is another risk, another family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Redesign the crossings. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. The dead cannot speak, but you can. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The collision occurred at the taxi's left front bumper and the e-bike's center front end. The injured party was a 23-year-old male passenger on the e-bike, who sustained a head contusion and remained conscious. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a primary contributing factor, indicating the taxi driver failed to maintain proper attention. Additionally, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' was noted, reflecting some confusion on the part of the bicyclist passenger. The taxi was unoccupied by the driver at the time but was licensed and traveling straight ahead.
