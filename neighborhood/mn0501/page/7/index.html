He woke up in the ambulance. The driver was caught, but the street stayed the same.</p><p>A woman, 24, lost her life at Union Square station. She tried to climb back to the platform. She could not. “Witnesses said the woman stepped onto the tracks shortly before the collision, but then attempted to climb back onto the platform,” <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/woman-struck-by-l-train-while-trying-to-climb-back-onto-platform-DX4725757>reported West Side Spirit</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have talked of Vision Zero.</strong> They have backed more speed cameras, lower speed limits, and intersection redesigns. The city now has the power to set 20 mph limits under Sammy’s Law. But the pace is slow. Cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Promised barriers in the subway have not arrived. The blood dries before the next press release.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-who-gets-heard>Who Gets Hurt, and Who Gets Heard</h3><p><strong>Taxis, SUVs, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left people broken.</strong> But the deadliest wounds come from speed and inattention. Policies that blame the walker or the cyclist miss the point. The street is the weapon. The silence of leaders is the accomplice.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-change>Act Now: Demand Change</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action today.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure creates a pilot program to install speed cameras near schools, aiming to catch drivers who exceed posted limits. The authorization for the program expires December 31, 2028. Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push.

The bill’s summary reads: "Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2028." No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the measure targets driver speed in zones where children walk, bike, and cross.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Robert Carroll and business leader Kathy Wylde criticized the governor’s floated payroll tax hike as unfair to city businesses.

The bill’s summary warns: 'No plan B for transit investments should congestion pricing not go through.' Senator Liz Krueger, mentioned in the debate, criticized the lack of alternative funding, saying, 'She is not aware of what she is referring to or where she believes that money will come from.' The delay leaves critical projects—like subway accessibility, new signals, and electric buses—unfunded. Without this money, vulnerable riders face more delays, breakdowns, and unsafe conditions.

Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk.

Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.'
