Twenty-one seriously hurt.</strong> That is the price Midtown South-Flatiron-Union Square has paid since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>one person died and eight more suffered serious injuries</strong>. Cyclists, pedestrians, workers—no one is spared.</p><p>Just last month, a 21-year-old cyclist was left with severe head wounds after colliding with a parked sedan on Fifth Avenue. In April, four pedestrians were crushed and bleeding after a taxi and sedan tangled on 5th Avenue near 17th Street. The sidewalk ran red.</p><h2 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h2><p>The city’s wounds are not silent. After another crash, a resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> The crowding and the signals are broken. Another voice cut through: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying,&rdquo;</a> a neighbor told reporters. The fear is constant. The danger is routine.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> Assembly Member Tony Simone has <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills to expand speed camera enforcement</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>hold reckless drivers accountable</a>. State Senator Liz Krueger <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted to require speed limiters for repeat speeders</a>. Council Member Erik Bottcher <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks</a>. These are steps, not leaps. The blood keeps coming.</p><p>But the city drags its feet on lowering the speed limit to 20 mph, even though the law now allows it. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. The city’s hands are not tied. They are idle.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

Vulnerable riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, State Sen. Jessica Ramos and colleagues sent a letter to city and state DOTs urging action against the 'demonization' of e-bikes and e-scooters. The letter, signed by Ramos and State Sen. Liz Krueger, demanded more education on safe riding and battery use, warning, 'We cannot allow a narrative to build against a vital, green, and growing mode of transportation.' Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries. The senators warned that inaction could lead to blanket bans, hitting delivery workers hardest. The city’s plan for safe charging hubs faces local opposition. DOT claims a 'holistic approach,' but vulnerable riders remain at risk as agencies drag their feet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State lawmakers pushed back. Hochul wants the city to cover more. The fight over who funds transit leaves riders in limbo. No new money means service cuts or fare hikes loom.</p><p class=mb3>On February 16, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams traveled to Albany to oppose Governor Hochul’s proposal for New York City to contribute an extra $500 million annually to the MTA. Adams argued, “MTA is a statewide obligation. We’re doing our share.” State lawmakers, including Assembly Member Ed Braunstein and State Senator Liz Krueger, countered that the city should help. Hochul’s budget would shift more costs—like Access-A-Ride and student Metrocards—to the city. Progressive lawmakers suggested taxing the wealthy and freezing fares. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins warned, “To increase fares would be detrimental.” The debate continues as the legislature drafts its own budget. No direct safety analysis was provided, but funding gaps threaten transit service, putting vulnerable riders at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
