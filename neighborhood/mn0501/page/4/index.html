A car turns. The street does not forgive. In Midtown South-Flatiron-Union Square, <strong>673 people have been injured and 3 killed</strong> since 2022. Twenty more left with wounds that will not heal—<strong>serious injuries</strong> that change a life in a blink. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. In the last year alone, <strong>226 people were hurt, 12 seriously, and one did not come home</strong>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians take the worst of it. Taxis, SUVs, trucks, bikes—each has left its mark. A taxi jumps the curb on Sixth Avenue, plows into a crowd. Four sent to the hospital, a nine-year-old boy among them. The driver stays at the scene. Police say there is no crime. The sidewalk is stained, but the law shrugs. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/young-boy-two-women-hospitalized-after-taxi-hits-pedestrians-in-midtown-manhattan>Gothamist</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city talks of safety. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many&rdquo; and vows to keep pushing for Vision Zero. <a href=#citations>NYC briefing notes</a> But the streets do not wait for speeches. The NYPD cracks down on cyclists and delivery workers, handing out criminal summonses for minor infractions. &ldquo;When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional,&rdquo; says Commissioner Jessica Tisch. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/cyclists-protest-nypd-criminalization-push-against-bikers-for-traffic-infractions-AD4665020>West Side Spirit</a> The crackdown falls hardest on those with the least power.

It is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, the toll grows. Call your council member. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. Tell Albany to keep speed cameras running. Join the fight. Stand with those who walk and ride. Do not let another family become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now.
