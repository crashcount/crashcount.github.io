A cyclist thrown bleeding on the curb. A pedestrian’s life ended by a turning SUV. In Midtown South-Flatiron-Union Square, the violence is constant. <strong>In the last twelve months, 228 people were injured and 12 suffered serious injuries. One person died.</strong></p><p>The numbers do not flinch. Since 2022, there have been <strong>681 injuries, 20 serious injuries, and 3 deaths</strong> in this district. Most of the wounded are not drivers. They are people on foot, on bikes, on mopeds. They are the ones who bleed first.</p><h3 id=the-human-toll>The Human Toll</h3><p>A cyclist in his fifties, memory wiped, bones broken, after a driver ran a red light and fled. “All my body was blood and the sweater,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-arrested-hit-run-52-year-old-bicyclist-west-village-last-month/16705843/>he said</a>. He woke up in the ambulance. The driver was caught, but the street stayed the same.</p><p>A woman, 24, lost her life at Union Square station. She tried to climb back to the platform. She could not. “Witnesses said the woman stepped onto the tracks shortly before the collision, but then attempted to climb back onto the platform,” <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/woman-struck-by-l-train-while-trying-to-climb-back-onto-platform-DX4725757>reported West Side Spirit</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have talked of Vision Zero.</strong> They have backed more speed cameras, lower speed limits, and intersection redesigns. The city now has the power to set 20 mph limits under Sammy’s Law. But the pace is slow. Cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Promised barriers in the subway have not arrived. The blood dries before the next press release.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-who-gets-heard>Who Gets Hurt, and Who Gets Heard</h3><p><strong>Taxis, SUVs, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left people broken.</strong> But the deadliest wounds come from speed and inattention. Policies that blame the walker or the cyclist miss the point. The street is the weapon. The silence of leaders is the accomplice.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-change>Act Now: Demand Change</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action today.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled "Citigroup Renews NYC Bike-Share Sponsorship — Is It Time For Public Funding?", highlighted the gap in service for low-income and outer-borough neighborhoods. Council Member Justin Brannan (District 47) criticized Citi Bike’s limited reach, saying, "Ya gotta love @CitiBikeNYC systematically icing out the 'outer' borough transit deserts." Advocates and labor leaders echoed calls for public funding, arguing the for-profit model fails vulnerable New Yorkers. Mayor Adams’s campaign promise to expand Citi Bike with city funding remains unfulfilled. The debate underscores a systemic failure: without public investment, bike-share stays out of reach for those who need it most. No formal safety analysis was provided, but advocates stress that lack of access keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The deal keeps the system afloat but relies on private money, not public funds. The matter, described as a debate on public funding for bike-share expansion, highlights the city’s outlier status among major bike-share cities. Council Member Erik Bottcher and others voiced concerns over poor service and limited reach. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called for city funding to expand access and lower prices.

It was introduced April 11, 2023, and pushed by Council Member Shahana K. Hanif as primary sponsor, with Jennifer Gutiérrez and over twenty others co-sponsoring. The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ ... and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.'
