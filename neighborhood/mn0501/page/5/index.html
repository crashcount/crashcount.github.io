On January 6, 2025, Council Member Tony Simone announced a legislative push to require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years.

The bill summary states: 'My legislation will require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years.' Simone urges the use of congestion pricing revenue for these safety upgrades, arguing, 'No priority is higher on any rider's mind, including mine, than safety on the system.'

The bill is under council review as of December 10, 2024. The measure seeks to overhaul regulations that force NYCHA to keep up over 400 sidewalk sheds—spanning 25 miles—often long after repairs finish. The matter summary states, 'reforming parts of the city’s broader shedding regulations that are a poor fit for NYCHA and a nuisance citywide.' Powers and co-sponsor Erik Bottcher aim to reduce shed length, extend inspection cycles, and allow more art and color on scaffolds. Jamie Rubin, NYCHA board head, supports the bill, noting that current rules rob residents of sunlight, safety, and outdoor space.

Erik Bottcher led the charge. The law forces owners to post contact info and lets DOT set strict standards. The goal: clear sidewalks, fewer obstacles, safer passage for all.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2024, the City Council approved a bill regulating sidewalk newsracks. The measure, sponsored by Council Member Erik Bottcher (District 3), passed through committee and aims to address neglected, broken, and obstructive newspaper boxes. The bill summary states it will 'establish clear guidelines and help ensure that our local publications get to maintain their newsracks while also helping to alleviate sidewalk congestion.' Bottcher’s action brings new requirements: owners must display contact information, and the Department of Transportation gains authority to set size, shape, and material standards. Sandra Ung, another council member, noted that without oversight, newsracks become a blight. The law seeks to reduce sidewalk clutter, making streets less hazardous for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece, titled 'Eliminating ‘parking minimums’ in NYC can help ease the housing crisis,' argues that required parking spaces in new developments block affordable housing and favor cars over people. Bottcher writes, 'By eliminating parking minimums, we can unlock the potential for more housing units in buildings across the city.' He highlights that parking mandates raise construction costs, limit design, and disrupt street life. Bottcher’s call joins a national trend: cities like Minneapolis and Buffalo have already scrapped these rules. The op-ed claims that ending parking minimums will promote walking, cycling, and transit, making streets safer and more welcoming for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
