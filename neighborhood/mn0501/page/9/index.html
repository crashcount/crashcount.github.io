She could not. “Witnesses said the woman stepped onto the tracks shortly before the collision, but then attempted to climb back onto the platform,” <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/woman-struck-by-l-train-while-trying-to-climb-back-onto-platform-DX4725757>reported West Side Spirit</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have talked of Vision Zero.</strong> They have backed more speed cameras, lower speed limits, and intersection redesigns. The city now has the power to set 20 mph limits under Sammy’s Law. But the pace is slow. Cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Promised barriers in the subway have not arrived. The blood dries before the next press release.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-who-gets-heard>Who Gets Hurt, and Who Gets Heard</h3><p><strong>Taxis, SUVs, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left people broken.</strong> But the deadliest wounds come from speed and inattention. Policies that blame the walker or the cyclist miss the point. The street is the weapon. The silence of leaders is the accomplice.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-change>Act Now: Demand Change</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The report cites 'Alcohol Involvement' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors to the collision. The sedan's right front bumper impacted multiple parked vehicles, including SUVs and sedans, causing damage primarily to their rear and side panels. The driver was wearing a lap belt and harness and was not ejected from the vehicle. The crash involved no pedestrians or cyclists. The driver's impairment and distraction directly led to the collision with stationary vehicles, highlighting systemic dangers posed by impaired driving in urban settings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads as primary sponsor, joined by Stevens, Marmorato, Brooks-Powers, and others. The bill would let institutions apply to use outdoor space for community events.

No more hiding behind vague reports. The city must count each incident. Data will show the toll. Vulnerable New Yorkers deserve the truth.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0255-2024 sits in the Committee on Public Safety after introduction on February 28, 2024. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle," forces the NYPD to add 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a specific reporting category in quarterly and annual use of force reports. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Won, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Avilés, Abreu, Ossé, Krishnan, Williams, Cabán, Nurse, Sanchez, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force. This change brings police violence by car into the light, exposing patterns that endanger pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill seeks to amend city law to "establish a reward for individuals who provide information leading to the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person who seriously injures or kills another individual in a hit-and-run accident." Council Member Rita C. Joseph leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, Louis, Bottcher, Hudson, Gennaro, and Williams. The bill authorizes the mayor, on the police commissioner's recommendation, to offer up to $1,000 for actionable tips. Law enforcement and city or state employees are excluded. The bill responds to the grim fact that many hit-and-runs go unsolved, leaving victims and families without answers. It aims to break the code of silence and help bring reckless drivers to justice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Civil penalties range from $250 to $400 per day, with impoundment for repeat violations. The bill excludes car dealerships and carsharing organizations. Council Members Nantasha M. Williams (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Erik D. Bottcher, and Vickie Paladino back the measure.

Introduced February 28, 2024, the bill reads: 'prohibiting the issuance of private vehicle parking permits and revoking such existing permits.' Council Members Julie Won (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, Gale Brewer, Christopher Marte, Erik Bottcher, Alexa Avilés, and the Brooklyn Borough President back the measure. They seek to stop city agencies from issuing parking permits to private vehicles unless the car belongs to an elected official. Permits for people with disabilities and those required by collective bargaining agreements are not affected. The bill repeals several administrative code sections tied to private parking privileges. Action aims to strip away special access, reduce curb abuse, and put public space back in public hands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
