No helmet, but the street did not forgive.</p><p class=mb3>A 29-year-old woman riding a bike westbound on West 27th Street in Manhattan collided with a parked sedan, according to the police report. The report states she suffered severe facial lacerations after striking the left side doors of the stationary vehicle. The sedan, registered in New Jersey, was parked and did not move before or during the crash. The police report cites 'Driver Inexperience' as a contributing factor in the collision. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, a detail included in the narrative, but only after the primary driver error. The report describes the aftermath in stark terms: 'Her face split open on the steel. Blood pooled on the pavement. The car never moved. She did, and then didn’t.' The crash underscores the lethal consequences of inexperience and the unforgiving nature of city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The police report highlights that the driver was unlicensed, a critical factor in the crash. No driver errors beyond the lack of a license are specified in the report. The victims’ actions are listed only as 'other actions in roadway,' with no indication from the report that these contributed to the collision. The focus remains on the unlicensed operation and the resulting harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
