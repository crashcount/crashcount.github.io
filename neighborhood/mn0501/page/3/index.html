A cyclist thrown bleeding on the curb. A pedestrian’s life ended by a turning SUV. In Midtown South-Flatiron-Union Square, the violence is constant. <strong>In the last twelve months, 228 people were injured and 12 suffered serious injuries. One person died.</strong></p><p>The numbers do not flinch. Since 2022, there have been <strong>681 injuries, 20 serious injuries, and 3 deaths</strong> in this district. Most of the wounded are not drivers. They are people on foot, on bikes, on mopeds. They are the ones who bleed first.</p><h3 id=the-human-toll>The Human Toll</h3><p>A cyclist in his fifties, memory wiped, bones broken, after a driver ran a red light and fled. “All my body was blood and the sweater,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-arrested-hit-run-52-year-old-bicyclist-west-village-last-month/16705843/>he said</a>. He woke up in the ambulance. The driver was caught, but the street stayed the same.</p><p>A woman, 24, lost her life at Union Square station. She tried to climb back to the platform. She could not. “Witnesses said the woman stepped onto the tracks shortly before the collision, but then attempted to climb back onto the platform,” <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/woman-struck-by-l-train-while-trying-to-climb-back-onto-platform-DX4725757>reported West Side Spirit</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have talked of Vision Zero.</strong> They have backed more speed cameras, lower speed limits, and intersection redesigns. The city now has the power to set 20 mph limits under Sammy’s Law. But the pace is slow. Cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Promised barriers in the subway have not arrived. The blood dries before the next press release.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-who-gets-heard>Who Gets Hurt, and Who Gets Heard</h3><p><strong>Taxis, SUVs, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left people broken.</strong> But the deadliest wounds come from speed and inattention. Policies that blame the walker or the cyclist miss the point. The street is the weapon. The silence of leaders is the accomplice.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-change>Act Now: Demand Change</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action today.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary states: 'New laws are set to finally tackle the scourge of unsightly sidewalk construction sheds and scaffolding structures around the city.' Powers said, 'This package of legislation puts forward reforms to fundamentally change our approach to scaffolding while ensuring safety is still the top priority.' Bottcher added, 'It’s time we cut back the endless sidewalk sheds that block our light.'

The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.

The 2023 Council bill banned street-side dining from December to March, restoring thousands of spaces to private car storage. The bill’s summary notes, 'outdoor dining is shrinking back to wealthier neighborhoods.' Mayor Adams signed the regulations. Assembly Member Tony Simone called the process 'overburdensome.' Advocates like Sara Lind and Christine Berthet slammed the rules as inequitable and harmful to pedestrians, saying sidewalk cafes now crowd walking space while car parking is prioritized. The Department of Transportation and Council trade blame for the system’s failures. Small businesses face high fees and complex applications, locking out many restaurants.

The matter, titled 'Hochul will defy Trump deadline to stop NYC congestion pricing — but insists president still backs her Penn Station revamp plan,' centers on Governor Hochul’s refusal to halt congestion pricing despite federal pressure. Simone, representing the Penn Station area, voiced support for both congestion pricing and a bold Penn Station overhaul, saying, 'It’s time to build a big bold Penn Station. I’m glad that she’s talking to the president about it.' He opposed linking the two projects, stating, 'I don’t think they should be connected.' Simone also welcomed Hochul’s resistance to Amtrak’s expansion plans that would raze neighborhoods.
