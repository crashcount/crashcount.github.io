A cyclist thrown bleeding on the curb. A pedestrian’s life ended by a turning SUV. In Midtown South-Flatiron-Union Square, the violence is constant. <strong>In the last twelve months, 228 people were injured and 12 suffered serious injuries. One person died.</strong></p><p>The numbers do not flinch. Since 2022, there have been <strong>681 injuries, 20 serious injuries, and 3 deaths</strong> in this district.

They are the ones who bleed first.</p><h3 id=the-human-toll>The Human Toll</h3><p>A cyclist in his fifties, memory wiped, bones broken, after a driver ran a red light and fled. “All my body was blood and the sweater,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-arrested-hit-run-52-year-old-bicyclist-west-village-last-month/16705843/>he said</a>. He woke up in the ambulance. The driver was caught, but the street stayed the same.</p><p>A woman, 24, lost her life at Union Square station. She tried to climb back to the platform. She could not. “Witnesses said the woman stepped onto the tracks shortly before the collision, but then attempted to climb back onto the platform,” <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/woman-struck-by-l-train-while-trying-to-climb-back-onto-platform-DX4725757>reported West Side Spirit</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have talked of Vision Zero.</strong> They have backed more speed cameras, lower speed limits, and intersection redesigns. The city now has the power to set 20 mph limits under Sammy’s Law. But the pace is slow. Cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Promised barriers in the subway have not arrived. The blood dries before the next press release.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-who-gets-heard>Who Gets Hurt, and Who Gets Heard</h3><p><strong>Taxis, SUVs, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left people broken.</strong> But the deadliest wounds come from speed and inattention. Policies that blame the walker or the cyclist miss the point. The street is the weapon. The silence of leaders is the accomplice.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-change>Act Now: Demand Change</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The street waits for change.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on June 15, 2025, that the NYC Department of Transportation’s plan to convert 34th Street into a busway drew mixed reactions at a Community Board 6 meeting. The board voted 31-5 in favor. Supporters called current bus speeds 'painfully slow' and urged the city to 'prioritize pedestrians and transit users.' Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.' The DOT says the busway could boost bus speeds by 15 percent. The proposal would force cars to exit 34th Street quickly or face tickets, echoing rules on 14th Street. The debate highlights the tension between transit improvements and neighborhood traffic concerns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article details heated opposition from local residents and bus riders, who argued the plan was rushed and lacked proper traffic analysis. Stacy Rauch, a daily bus rider, said, 'The bigger problem is we don’t have enough buses.' Critics worried diverted car traffic would overwhelm nearby streets. The city compared the move to the 14th Street car ban, but residents noted differences in bus frequency. The article highlights accusations of conflicts of interest involving community board members and advocacy groups. The policy aims to prioritize buses and vulnerable road users, but leaves open questions about implementation and neighborhood impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
