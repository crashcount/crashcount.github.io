Over one thousand injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>one person died and 297 were hurt</strong> in 566 crashes. One was a child. One was someone’s parent. The street does not care who you are.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians take the worst of it.</strong> Trucks, SUVs, bikes, mopeds—each has left bodies broken or dead. A 43-year-old woman, crossing with the light, was killed by a turning dump truck on 80th Street. A 75-year-old man died after a bike hit him at Broadway and Roosevelt. A 78-year-old woman was struck by a moped in a crosswalk. A man was crushed by an SUV on Broadway. The list goes on. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=promises-and-delays>Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. But the deaths keep coming. The city has new powers under Sammy’s Law to lower speed limits to 20 mph. The law is on the books. The streets are not yet safer. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Each delay is another risk, another family left to mourn.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>The most vulnerable pay first.</strong> In Elmhurst, the old and the young are hit hardest. Cars and trucks killed and maimed. Bikes and mopeds, too. The street is a gauntlet. The city counts the bodies. The politicians count the votes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. <strong>Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras.

The measure, discussed in the council and supported by the NYC Department of Transportation, aims to ticket drivers who double park or block critical spaces. The bill summary states: 'Double parking and curb violations aren’t just a nuisance – they’re a public safety hazard.' Raga and DOT officials argue that manual enforcement cannot keep up with rising car numbers, leaving pedestrians and cyclists at risk. Raga led the push, highlighting blocked hydrants and crosswalks as threats. DOT said automated enforcement 'helps keep streets clear, reduces congestion, and protects New Yorkers.' Delivery drivers voiced concern about work impacts, but the bill’s focus remains on clearing space for vulnerable road users. The proposal awaits further council action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assemblymember Steven Raga leads the push for a $35 million pilot, aiming to install 150 cameras targeting double parking and illegal stops. The bill, not yet assigned a committee or number, seeks to automate enforcement where manual efforts fall short. Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead. The Department of Transportation supports the expansion, stating, 'Automated enforcement has proven to change driver behavior and make our streets safer for everyone.' The debate centers on whether automation or police presence best protects pedestrians and cyclists from blocked lanes and traffic hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article quotes Holden: 'She knows the congestion scam tax is bad for New York—she’s admitted as much before—but, as always, her decisions are purely political, not based on what’s right for the people.' Holden’s opposition aligns with critics who say Hochul’s support for the $9 congestion fee contradicts her earlier positions.

Surveillance footage showed the Mercedes 'barreled through an East Elmhurst intersection' at 4:15 a.m. Diaz, headed to work at LaGuardia, died at the scene. Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail.

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment.

The U.S. Department of Transportation revoked federal approval for the Central Business District Tolling Program, which charged vehicles to enter Manhattan below 60th Street.

Holden (District 30) praised the federal intervention, calling congestion pricing 'unfair and burdensome for working families.' The MTA, Governor Hochul, and transit advocates condemned the move and pledged legal action.
