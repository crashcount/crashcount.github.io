Over one thousand injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>one person died and 297 were hurt</strong> in 566 crashes. One was a child. One was someone’s parent. The street does not care who you are.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians take the worst of it.</strong> Trucks, SUVs, bikes, mopeds—each has left bodies broken or dead. A 43-year-old woman, crossing with the light, was killed by a turning dump truck on 80th Street. A 75-year-old man died after a bike hit him at Broadway and Roosevelt. A 78-year-old woman was struck by a moped in a crosswalk. A man was crushed by an SUV on Broadway. The list goes on. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=promises-and-delays>Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. But the deaths keep coming. The city has new powers under Sammy’s Law to lower speed limits to 20 mph. The law is on the books. The streets are not yet safer. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Each delay is another risk, another family left to mourn.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>The most vulnerable pay first.</strong> In Elmhurst, the old and the young are hit hardest. Cars and trucks killed and maimed. Bikes and mopeds, too. The street is a gauntlet. The city counts the bodies. The politicians count the votes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. <strong>Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras.

Holden (District 30) publicly criticized Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine for supporting policies to reduce car usage, including more bike lanes and congestion pricing. The matter, reported by the New York Post, highlights Levine’s history of 41 traffic violations, including speeding and blocking bike lanes. Holden said, “He’s the last person who should be advocating for more bike lanes, having been caught blocking one.” Despite the criticism, Levine continues to promote street redesigns and enforcement, aiming to convert a section of the West Side Highway into a bike lane and favor non-car owners in community board appointments. Levine’s spokesman stated that all tickets were paid promptly and steps have been taken to prevent future infractions. Street-safety groups back Levine’s agenda, which centers on protecting vulnerable road users by reducing car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The toll mounts.</p><p class=mb3>On August 17, 2022, State Senator Michael Gianaris called for urgent pedestrian safety improvements after a deadly hit-and-run in Queens. The incident, which killed 74-year-old Be Tran at Myrtle and Seneca Avenues, triggered public outcry. Gianaris criticized the city’s process, saying, 'They have to wait until that happens to get the score high enough to realize that an intersection needs protection.' He joined activists from the Ridgewood Tenants Union and Transportation Alternatives, demanding new signals and better street design. Gianaris said he contacted the Department of Transportation a year earlier with no result. The city claims over 20 traffic control approvals in Ridgewood, but residents and advocates say it’s not enough. The call comes as pedestrian deaths and injuries continue to climb citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The vehicle involved was a 2018 Honda sedan traveling east. The driver was unlicensed and distracted, contributing to the crash. The point of impact was the center front end of the sedan.
