Over one thousand injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>one person died and 297 were hurt</strong> in 566 crashes. One was a child. One was someone’s parent. The street does not care who you are.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians take the worst of it.</strong> Trucks, SUVs, bikes, mopeds—each has left bodies broken or dead. A 43-year-old woman, crossing with the light, was killed by a turning dump truck on 80th Street. A 75-year-old man died after a bike hit him at Broadway and Roosevelt. A 78-year-old woman was struck by a moped in a crosswalk. A man was crushed by an SUV on Broadway. The list goes on. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=promises-and-delays>Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. But the deaths keep coming. The city has new powers under Sammy’s Law to lower speed limits to 20 mph. The law is on the books. The streets are not yet safer. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Each delay is another risk, another family left to mourn.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>The most vulnerable pay first.</strong> In Elmhurst, the old and the young are hit hardest. Cars and trucks killed and maimed. Bikes and mopeds, too. The street is a gauntlet. The city counts the bodies. The politicians count the votes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. <strong>Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras.

Councilmember Shekar Krishnan, who campaigned for this change, voiced strong support: 'This design improves pedestrian safety and expands accessibility for all people.' DOT officials committed to ongoing collaboration. Some Community Board 3 leaders raised concerns about transparency, scooters, disability access, and environmental review, but DOT called these minor and solvable. The plan has broad support from local advocates and is set to begin implementation in June, with more improvements in 2023.

The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began.

The bill sought to limit the sidewalk area that residential or commercial property owners must maintain to thirty feet from the property line. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to limiting the amount of sidewalk area that private property owners are responsible for maintaining.' Council Members Robert F. Holden (primary sponsor), Kalman Yeger, and Francisco P. Moya backed the bill. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage. The bill would have shifted some sidewalk responsibility away from private owners, but left gaps in accountability. The city retains liability for areas beyond the thirty-foot limit, but the fractured system remains. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, wheelchair users—still face hazards from uneven, neglected sidewalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a 'broken promise and failure of the prior administration,' centers on the city’s failure to ban cars from the full length of 78th Street between 34th Avenue and Northern Boulevard. Council Member Shekar Krishnan led the charge, criticizing the city for allowing Koeppel Mazda to use park space as a service entrance. Krishnan called this 'offensive to the notion of parks equity' and demanded urgent action to remove car access. Parks Commissioner Susan Donoghue acknowledged the issue and committed to working with DOT and City Hall to resolve it.

Introduced March 24, 2022, it urges Albany to pass S.5004. The resolution’s title: 'calling upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.5004, to enhance the fitness and safety requirements for certain licensed individuals.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor, District 44) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) led the push. The bill responds to the death of Madeline Sershen, 17, killed by an 88-year-old driver who ran a red. S.5004 would require drivers to prove medical fitness with a physician’s exam after their seventh license renewal. New York’s current rules only demand a vision test every eight years, far less strict than many states. The council’s action highlights a gap in protections for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She deferred to DOT. Council Member Krishnan pushed for a linear park and more parks funding. The city’s most vulnerable wait as agencies talk.</p><p class=mb3>On March 23, 2022, the City Council held a hearing on open streets and parks funding. Parks Commissioner Susan Donoghue called the 34th Avenue open street 'absolutely amazing,' but said she cannot unilaterally convert it into a linear park. She stressed the need for interagency cooperation, especially with the Department of Transportation. Council Member Shekar Krishnan, a supporter of the park conversion, said, 'We are so excited to work on transforming it into a linear park for a community that needs it so badly.' Krishnan also called for the Parks budget to be raised to 1 percent of the city budget. Donoghue made no firm commitment, repeating the administration’s focus on collaboration. Budget talks with the mayor continue. No direct safety assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
