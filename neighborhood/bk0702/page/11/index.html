But bikes and mopeds are not spared. In the last three years, SUVs and cars killed two pedestrians and left four with serious injuries. Trucks and buses, one moderate injury.

The council can act. The mayor can act. But the limit stands. <strong>Speed cameras</strong> save lives, but their future is always in doubt. Albany holds the switch. Every delay is a gamble with someone else’s life.</p><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They promise safer crossings, more cameras, better design. But the work is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit.
