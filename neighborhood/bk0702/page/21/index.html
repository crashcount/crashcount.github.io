They had the light. A BMW ran the red, hit them, and kept going. Both men died in the crosswalk. Their names were Kex Un Chen and Faqui Lin. The street is wide. The cars go fast. The city has known this for years. Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch, according to <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>Gothamist</a>.</p><h3 id=the-toll-grows>The Toll Grows</h3><p>In the last twelve months, Sunset Park (West) saw 2 deaths and 528 injuries from traffic crashes.

The living cross nine lanes to get to school.</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk.

At a rally, Restler said, "It is wrong how deadly this strip is." The officials demand mid-block crossings, daylighted intersections, raised crosswalks, curb extensions, and safer pedestrian space near BQE ramps. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized city resistance to reallocating street space, saying, "They drag their feet because they don’t want to do the inevitable." The Department of Transportation has agreed only to study new crosswalks. The bill is not yet formal legislation but marks a push for action after years of delay.

The bill failed to enter the 2023 state budget, shifting responsibility to the City Council. In 2021, the Council backed a home rule message 42-6, but the Assembly blocked it. Last year, the Council reversed course and failed to pass the message. This session, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, with 10 sponsors. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers must hold a hearing before a vote. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Brooks-Powers have not signed on, citing negotiations. The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.' Data show slower speeds save lives. Advocates and victims’ families keep pushing.
