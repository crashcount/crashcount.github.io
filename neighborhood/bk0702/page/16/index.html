The city has lowered speed limits, built bike lanes, and put up cameras. But the work is not done. The law that forces repeat dangerous drivers to take safety courses has lapsed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done it everywhere. Cameras that catch speeding may go dark if Albany does not act.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day someone else bleeds. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits. Demand Albany keep the cameras on.

The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, targets drivers with six or more automated speed or red light tickets, or eleven license points in 18 months. The measure would force these drivers to install devices that cap speed at five miles per hour above the limit. Gounardes said, 'There is a persistent cohort of drivers... driving on our streets recklessly without any consequences.' The bill was unveiled at the site of a fatal pedestrian crash in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which mandates safety courses for repeat offenders, has faced criticism for weak enforcement.

New Jersey sues. Assemblymember Carroll calls the suit a stunt. Officials defend the plan’s review. The fight is sharp. Streets remain dangerous. Vulnerable road users wait for real change.</p><p class=mb3>On July 21, 2023, Assemblymember Robert Carroll (District 44) responded to New Jersey’s lawsuit against New York’s congestion pricing plan. The matter, titled “New York Doubles Down on Congestion Pricing After New Jersey Sues,” saw Carroll label the suit a 'stunt' and accuse Governor Murphy of ignoring environmental and quality-of-life concerns. State Senator Andrew Gounardes called the lawsuit a cynical move to control New York’s roads. MTA officials, including John McCarthy, defended the environmental review, citing extensive outreach and public hearings. The bill’s status is an official response to legal challenge, not a council vote or committee action. No direct safety impact assessment for vulnerable road users was provided. The debate underscores the ongoing struggle to make streets safer for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes called the suit 'a cynical attempt' by New Jersey to interfere. Carroll labeled it 'a stunt.' MTA spokesperson John McCarthy said the environmental assessment 'covered every conceivable potential traffic, air quality, social and economic effect.' The MTA also pledged mitigation for environmental justice communities. The bill’s status is active, with strong support from New York’s leadership and ongoing opposition from New Jersey.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bike lanes appear, but real safety gains remain unclear.</p><p class=mb3>On July 7, 2023, the Department of Transportation unveiled redesign concepts for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway’s Atlantic Avenue interchange. The plans, discussed in committee, propose new highway off-ramps on Hicks Street. The matter summary states: 'DOT proposals rely on outdated approaches by building new highway ramps instead of eliminating them.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon criticized the plan for increasing traffic and pollution near homes, urging a new approach: 'They need to go back to the drawing board.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called out the reliance on old infrastructure, saying, 'The proposals should not be doubling down on the infrastructure and transportation of the past.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said, 'They don't improve safety, they don't improve traffic, and they certainly don't improve any of the surrounding communities.' All concepts include a buffered or protected bike lane on Atlantic Avenue, but the impact on vulnerable road users remains uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their bulk crushes bodies and streets. Lawmakers want heavier vehicles to pay more. Revenue would fund safer roads. The bill follows a grim rise in deaths, especially among children. The city bleeds. The council moves. The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill to increase registration fees for heavy vehicles and SUVs in New York. The proposal, announced June 23, 2023, aims to direct new revenue toward street safety projects. The report behind the bill states: 'Injuries from crashes involving large vehicles increased by 91 percent and fatalities by 75 percent between 2016 and 2019.' Mamdani said, 'This is an initiative to make our streets safer for our children.' Gounardes called out the public cost of 'mini-tanks.' The bill responds to data showing nearly half of children killed on city streets were struck by drivers of large vehicles, rising to 80 percent in 2022. Lawmakers call this common-sense action to address the deadly toll of oversized cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
