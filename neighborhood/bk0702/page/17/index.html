Delivery workers’ safety and livelihoods hung in the balance. Lawmakers targeted sellers, not riders. The bills aimed to stop deadly fires without punishing those who rely on e-bikes to survive.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, the New York City Council advanced a package of lithium-ion battery safety bills. Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event was not a council bill but a public response to traffic violence. State Senator Andrew Gounardes, mentioned in the event, spoke of the need for government action to make streets safer, saying, 'There’s work to do on every level of government to make the streets safer.' Mayor Eric Adams emphasized Vision Zero and the need for mental health resources, stating, 'Vision Zero [should be] an actualization as we make our streets safe.' Steve Mei, of the Chinese-American Planning Council, called for more city-funded mental health services, especially for seniors. The vigil underscored the community’s grief and the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.

The bill, now before the council, seeks to amend zoning laws to require special permits for new facilities. The measure aims to stop warehouse clustering near schools, parks, and homes, and mandates studies on truck traffic and air quality. The proposal, described as a response to 'an epidemic of truck traffic,' targets companies like Amazon whose rapid delivery model floods streets with trucks. Avilés declared, 'This is environmental racism. Last-mile facilities follow the same pattern, dumping environmental burdens on low-income communities of color.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez joined, demanding companies 'be responsible, take our communities into account so that we can breathe cleaner air.' The Adams administration expressed concern about economic impacts but supports electrification and cargo bike incentives.

State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymembers Robert Carroll and Zohran Mamdani also participated, urging Albany to boost state funding and implement congestion pricing. The lawmakers oppose fare hikes and the rider-funded model, calling for public dollars to improve frequency and reliability.
