The city has lowered speed limits, built bike lanes, and put up cameras. But the work is not done. The law that forces repeat dangerous drivers to take safety courses has lapsed.

Cameras that catch speeding may go dark if Albany does not act.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day someone else bleeds. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits.

Gounardes slammed the current rules as too lenient, saying, "For some drivers, the first time they take the wheel [as a licensed driver] they are in sole control of their car." Carroll called the requirement "reasonable." Stephen Walling, president of the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools, said the bill would "go a long way towards keeping all New Yorkers safer on our roads." The NYC Department of Transportation called driver education "crucial" for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users, and is reviewing the proposal.

He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year. The mayor pressed for 24/7 camera operation and renewed NYPD focus.

State Senator Andrew Gounardes echoed Adams, questioning why lawmakers outside the city control local street safety. Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement has dropped and pledged to prioritize it.

The move aimed to open transit, cut car trips, and ease city movement. The resolution gathered broad support but stalled, filed at session’s end. No action. No change.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0008-2022, filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, called on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to make subways and buses fare-free on major holidays. Introduced February 10, 2022, and filed December 31, 2023, the measure read: "Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to make subways and buses fare-free on major holidays." Council Member Darlene Mealy led as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Menin, Louis, Yeger, Hanif, Joseph, Ossé, Nurse, Gutiérrez, Avilés, Cabán, Richardson Jordan, and Brooks-Powers. The bill cited global fare-free transit efforts and past local fare suspensions. Despite wide co-sponsorship, the resolution ended the session without passage or impact. No safety analyst reviewed its effect on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates want $500 million yearly to keep subways and buses moving. Riders face fare hikes and service cuts if lawmakers stall. The fight is urgent. Riders wait. Cars kill. Transit saves lives.</p><p class=mb3>This funding debate centers on Gov. Hochul’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget, which allocates $6.6 billion in operating aid for the MTA but lacks new dedicated revenue. The proposal, discussed on January 28, 2022, has not advanced to a formal committee or bill stage. The matter: 'Who Wants To Give The MTA Half A Billion Dollars?' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backs progressive funding, saying, 'Funding high-ridership bus routes and the subway such that transit options would be arriving every six minutes is something we need to be pushing for.' Comptroller Brad Lander and advocates like the Riders Alliance demand $500 million per year to avoid fare hikes and boost service. The push is clear: more frequent, affordable transit keeps vulnerable New Yorkers out of harm’s way. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the stakes for pedestrians and riders are life and death.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
