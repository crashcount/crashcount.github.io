They had the light. A BMW ran the red, hit them, and kept going. Both men died in the crosswalk. Their names were Kex Un Chen and Faqui Lin. The street is wide. The cars go fast. The city has known this for years. Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch, according to <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>Gothamist</a>.</p><h3 id=the-toll-grows>The Toll Grows</h3><p>In the last twelve months, Sunset Park (West) saw 2 deaths and 528 injuries from traffic crashes. Four people were seriously hurt. Pedestrians, cyclists, children—no one is spared. The dead do not get second chances. The living cross nine lanes to get to school.</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk. Streets Stay Deadly.</h3><p>After the latest deaths, local leaders stood on the corner and spoke. &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy.

What is going on? We got word last fall that there was a pause, but an indefinite pause and I don&rsquo;t know what that means. There&rsquo;s been no conversation, no updates.&rdquo;</p><p>The city promised a redesign. The plan stalled. The street stayed the same. The deaths kept coming.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p>Speed cameras work. Lower speed limits save lives. Local leaders have voted to extend school speed zones and backed bills to curb repeat speeders. But on Third Avenue, the city delays. The cost is paid in blood.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city finish the job. Streets are for people.

Seabrook allegedly crashed a Kia Sportage into a Toyota Yaris carrying Wallace and friends, then fled the scene on foot. Wallace died; two others were critically injured. The Toyota’s driver was also charged with driving without a license. Seabrook faces charges including manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and leaving the scene. The article quotes Wallace’s aunt: “He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered.” The case highlights the deadly consequences of reckless driving and fleeing crash scenes in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

"This means no new station elevators for elderly and disabled riders, and no new subway signals to speed up commutes for working New Yorkers."" -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration withdrew federal approval for New York City's congestion pricing program. U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy cited burdens on working-class drivers and questioned the legality of using toll revenue for transit. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit to challenge the move, arguing the program is settled law and already reduces congestion. State Senators Andrew Gounardes and Zellnor Myrie condemned the action, warning, 'Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system.' The withdrawal aligns with New Jersey's opposition and threatens transit upgrades like elevators for elderly and disabled riders. Local officials and advocates say ending congestion pricing will harm vulnerable road users and worsen street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, covering 750 school zones, needs state approval before June. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls speed cameras 'one of the most effective tools' to stop deadly driving. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who sponsored the last reauthorization, says, 'my bill to expand the speed camera program has saved lives.' The city wants stronger penalties for repeat offenders and action on license plate fraud, which lets millions of violations go unpunished. The report shows cameras cut speeding by 94 percent and reduce injuries and deaths. The program faces political hurdles, but the evidence is clear: speed cameras protect people on foot and bike.
