Multiple vehicles, including sedans, SUVs, and a taxi, were traveling northbound when the collision happened. The primary contributing factor cited was driver inattention or distraction. One occupant, a 39-year-old female passenger, was injured with neck trauma and whiplash but was not ejected and was conscious at the scene. She was restrained by a lap belt. The impact points included the right rear quarter panel of an SUV and the left side doors of a Tesla sedan.
