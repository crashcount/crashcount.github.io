The city has lowered speed limits, built bike lanes, and put up cameras. But the work is not done. The law that forces repeat dangerous drivers to take safety courses has lapsed.

Cameras that catch speeding may go dark if Albany does not act.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day someone else bleeds. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits.

The pedestrian, a 43-year-old male, was crossing with the signal when the collision occurred. The point of impact was the vehicle's left front bumper, causing abrasions to the pedestrian's face. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a primary contributing factor. The pedestrian's role was noted as 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian at Intersection,' and he was conscious after the crash. While the report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, the critical driver error was distraction. The vehicle was going straight ahead, and the damage was limited to the left front bumper. This incident underscores the persistent danger posed by distracted driving in urban intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
