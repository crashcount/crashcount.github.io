Nearly four hundred injured in the last year.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. In Bay Ridge, the violence comes steady—pedestrians, cyclists, riders, and children. No one is spared. In the last twelve months, 513 crashes tore through these streets. The dead: a 35-year-old, a 65-year-old, an 18-year-old. The living: left with broken bones, lost work, empty chairs at dinner.</p><p>A moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother said, &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did,&rdquo; as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>. The driver was drunk and unlicensed. The passenger survived with fractures. The driver was arraigned and released without bail, at least for now.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks—these are the weapons.</strong> In Bay Ridge, cars and trucks caused the most pain: 3 deaths, 161 injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds: 6 injuries. Bikes: 1 serious injury, 10 more hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero. The city boasts of new laws.</strong> But in Bay Ridge, the carnage does not stop. Speed cameras work, but only where they are allowed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done so here. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders. No press conferences. No promises kept.</p><p>A brother waits for justice. &ldquo;We’ll see how it goes forth. Hopefully we get to be there for the trial, if there is a trial, and be able to talk on my brother’s behalf. But other than that, just on my behalf, there’s no hate,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>his brother told the NY Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every block. Demand streets that put people first.

Borelli, Justin L. Brannan, Robert F. Holden, and Kalman Yeger sponsored. The bill required DOT to investigate illegal curb cut complaints within 30 days, mark illegal cuts with green paint, and force owners to restore or legalize them. If owners failed, DOT would repair and recover costs. Community boards would get notice of new curb cut permits and sixty days to comment. The bill did not pass.

The bill remains in committee. The measure would give whistleblowers 25% of the ticket, up to $75. The matter targets drivers who obscure or remove plates to dodge automated enforcement. As city and state agencies rely more on cameras to catch speeders and red-light runners, more drivers hide their plates. The Department of Transportation says cameras failed to ticket over 4% of violators last fall, up from 1% in 2019. Advocates accuse police of lax enforcement and even breaking the law themselves. Gounardes’s bill, still stalled, aims to close this loophole and put power in the hands of citizens.

The matter arose after attorney Adam White was arrested for removing plastic from an obscured license plate; charges were later dropped by Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, citing 'insufficient evidence.' The bill, discussed at a press conference, aims to crack down on license plate defacement and illegal parking, which Restler says is rampant among city workers and police. State Sen.

The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Community Board’s Transportation and Public Safety Committee, chaired by Sid Meyer, voted to support the change and insisted DOT maintain and protect the Bond Street bike lane with a physical barrier. Restler said, 'We believe that this proposal will improve traffic flow and enhance the public’s access to essential services, deliveries, and residences.' DOT is reviewing the proposal.

Restler, who once failed to ride the stretch without leaving the lane due to illegal parking, called the redesign 'real safety in downtown Brooklyn.' DOT data shows 29 cyclists injured and one killed on this stretch since 2012. The overhaul separates cyclists from moving vehicles, reducing risk for Brooklyn’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists now ride behind parked cars, shielded from traffic. The old, chaotic street saw 29 cyclist injuries and one death. Councilmember Restler pushed for this change.</p><p class=mb3>On October 12, 2022, the Department of Transportation held a ribbon-cutting for the new protected bike lane on Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn's District 33. The overhaul converted the street to one-way eastbound and installed a two-way, parking-protected bike lane. The matter summary reads: 'DOT cuts ribbon on newly fortified Schermerhorn Street bike lane.' Councilmember Lincoln Restler, who championed the redesign, attended the event and called it 'a great friggin day for Brooklyn.' The old lanes were unprotected and blocked by double-parked cars, forcing cyclists into traffic. Since 2012, 29 cyclists have been injured and one killed along this stretch. The new design separates cyclists from vehicles, aiming to end the danger that plagued this busy corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
