Nearly four hundred injured in the last year.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. In Bay Ridge, the violence comes steady—pedestrians, cyclists, riders, and children. No one is spared. In the last twelve months, 513 crashes tore through these streets. The dead: a 35-year-old, a 65-year-old, an 18-year-old. The living: left with broken bones, lost work, empty chairs at dinner.</p><p>A moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother said, &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did,&rdquo; as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>. The driver was drunk and unlicensed. The passenger survived with fractures. The driver was arraigned and released without bail, at least for now.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks—these are the weapons.</strong> In Bay Ridge, cars and trucks caused the most pain: 3 deaths, 161 injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds: 6 injuries. Bikes: 1 serious injury, 10 more hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero. The city boasts of new laws.</strong> But in Bay Ridge, the carnage does not stop. Speed cameras work, but only where they are allowed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done so here. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders. No press conferences. No promises kept.</p><p>A brother waits for justice. &ldquo;We’ll see how it goes forth. Hopefully we get to be there for the trial, if there is a trial, and be able to talk on my brother’s behalf. But other than that, just on my behalf, there’s no hate,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>his brother told the NY Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every block. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another family to lose a son. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, introduced by Inez Barron, requires the Department of Transportation to install traffic control devices at every intersection next to a school by September 30, 2024. Council Member Justin Brannan, representing District 47, called the law a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn't be some huge colossal victory.' The law aims to bypass restrictive federal guidelines that block safety fixes. Council members and residents blasted DOT for slow, arbitrary action and years of denied requests, sometimes only reversed after tragedy. The Adams administration promises to redesign 1,000 more intersections, but families and advocates demand faster, decisive protection for children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics, like StreetsPAC's Eric McClure, argue the bill subsidizes SUV use and endangers city streets, stating, 'We shouldn’t be bending over backwards to further subsidize someone’s choice to drive an SUV or pickup truck in New York City.'
