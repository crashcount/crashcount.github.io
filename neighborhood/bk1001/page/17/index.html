Nearly four hundred injured in the last year.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. In Bay Ridge, the violence comes steady—pedestrians, cyclists, riders, and children. No one is spared. In the last twelve months, 513 crashes tore through these streets. The dead: a 35-year-old, a 65-year-old, an 18-year-old. The living: left with broken bones, lost work, empty chairs at dinner.</p><p>A moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother said, &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did,&rdquo; as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>.

The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, centered on fears that eliminating bus stops would harm those with few transit options. The matter, titled 'Southern Brooklynites blast MTA’s proposed bus redesign at Coney Island protest,' drew attention to the impact on seniors, people with disabilities, and low-income riders. Brannan launched a petition urging the MTA to reconsider, stating, 'I'm going to make sure the MTA knows this plan won't fly with me.'

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Governor Hochul’s 2023 state budget proposal, analyzed March 3, 2023, keeps New York State’s long-running refusal to match MTA funding under law 18-b. The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt. The budget leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as transit stagnates and car dominance persists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, expected before lawmakers next month, keeps sidewalk dining year-round but limits curbside 'streeteries' to warmer months. Council Member Justin Brannan said, 'The plan is not to make permanent the current outdoor dining sheds you see on our streets ... but to create a better program with new rules, new standards, clear design guidelines and operating requirements.' Speaker Adrienne Adams leads the Council in fine-tuning the bill, while Mayor Adams supports Department of Transportation oversight. Council Member Marjorie Velázquez’s original bill would have shifted control to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans argue, 'A year-round option is an absolute must.' The bill responds to complaints about noise, rats, and lost parking, but also credits the program with saving 100,000 jobs.

The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.

The project, described as bringing 'a full suite of safety upgrades and fully repair[ing] the roadbed,' will include concrete curb extensions, pedestrian islands, raised crosswalks, new crosswalks, and traffic signals. Brannan, who advocated for the funding, said, 'Why is the city allowing this to happen on New Utrecht Avenue?' and pushed for an earlier construction start.

Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by thirty other members. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst reviewed the impact, but torn-up streets are a known threat to pedestrians and cyclists. The bill is dead. The hazard lives on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He promised to crack down on reckless drivers and electrify for-hire vehicles by 2030. But he skipped transit upgrades, parking reform, and deeper equity. Critics called the vision incomplete.</p><p class=mb3>On January 26, 2023, Mayor Adams delivered his State of the City address, outlining new transportation and public space plans. The speech promised a $375-million investment in public spaces, permanent open streets, and a push for zero-emission for-hire vehicles by 2030. Adams also highlighted bills targeting reckless drivers and announced a new Director of the Public Realm. The mayor said, 'We will require the 100,000-plus high-volume for-hire vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2030.' Council Member Andrew Gounardes praised the ROADS Act, saying it 'could save hundreds of lives each year.' But advocates like Open Plans and Betsy Plum criticized the lack of action on transit equity, parking reform, and access for low-income New Yorkers. The address left out bus lane expansion, Fair Fares growth, and city fleet reduction, drawing fire for missing bold, systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
