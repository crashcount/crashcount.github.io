Demand Action Before Another Family Mourns.</h1></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Bay Ridge: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 23, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-toll-in-bay-ridge>The Toll in Bay Ridge</h3><p><strong>Three dead. Nearly four hundred injured in the last year.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. In Bay Ridge, the violence comes steady—pedestrians, cyclists, riders, and children. No one is spared. In the last twelve months, 513 crashes tore through these streets. The dead: a 35-year-old, a 65-year-old, an 18-year-old. The living: left with broken bones, lost work, empty chairs at dinner.</p><p>A moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother said, &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did,&rdquo; as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>. The driver was drunk and unlicensed. The passenger survived with fractures. The driver was arraigned and released without bail, at least for now.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks—these are the weapons.</strong> In Bay Ridge, cars and trucks caused the most pain: 3 deaths, 161 injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds: 6 injuries. Bikes: 1 serious injury, 10 more hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero. The city boasts of new laws.</strong> But in Bay Ridge, the carnage does not stop. Speed cameras work, but only where they are allowed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done so here. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders. No press conferences. No promises kept.</p><p>A brother waits for justice. &ldquo;We’ll see how it goes forth. Hopefully we get to be there for the trial, if there is a trial, and be able to talk on my brother’s behalf. But other than that, just on my behalf, there’s no hate,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>his brother told the NY Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every block. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another family to lose a son. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Reckless drivers face real consequences.</p><p class=mb3>On August 2, 2023, State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher announced new legislation targeting recidivist reckless drivers. The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure targets those with a record of speeding and red-light violations. It aims to slow down the worst offenders and curb the rising toll of traffic deaths.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2023, lawmakers introduced a bill requiring speed-limiting devices for repeat reckless drivers. The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, targets drivers with six or more automated speed or red light tickets, or eleven license points in 18 months. The measure would force these drivers to install devices that cap speed at five miles per hour above the limit. Gounardes said, 'There is a persistent cohort of drivers... driving on our streets recklessly without any consequences.' The bill was unveiled at the site of a fatal pedestrian crash in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which mandates safety courses for repeat offenders, has faced criticism for weak enforcement. This new bill seeks to close those gaps and directly slow down the most dangerous drivers on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Politicians and experts slam the move. They say it copies old mistakes, ignores safety, and brings pollution closer to homes. Bike lanes appear, but real safety gains remain unclear.</p><p class=mb3>On July 7, 2023, the Department of Transportation unveiled redesign concepts for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway’s Atlantic Avenue interchange. The plans, discussed in committee, propose new highway off-ramps on Hicks Street. The matter summary states: 'DOT proposals rely on outdated approaches by building new highway ramps instead of eliminating them.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon criticized the plan for increasing traffic and pollution near homes, urging a new approach: 'They need to go back to the drawing board.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called out the reliance on old infrastructure, saying, 'The proposals should not be doubling down on the infrastructure and transportation of the past.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said, 'They don't improve safety, they don't improve traffic, and they certainly don't improve any of the surrounding communities.' All concepts include a buffered or protected bike lane on Atlantic Avenue, but the impact on vulnerable road users remains uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
