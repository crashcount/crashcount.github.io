Nearly four hundred injured in the last year.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. In Bay Ridge, the violence comes steady—pedestrians, cyclists, riders, and children. No one is spared. In the last twelve months, 513 crashes tore through these streets. The dead: a 35-year-old, a 65-year-old, an 18-year-old. The living: left with broken bones, lost work, empty chairs at dinner.</p><p>A moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother said, &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did,&rdquo; as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>.

Riders with disabilities and seniors need fast, flexible trips. Demand surges. The program means fewer waits, more freedom. The city urges permanence. Vulnerable New Yorkers depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0695-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced December 19, 2024, it urges the MTA to make the Access-A-Ride On-Demand E-Hail Pilot Program permanent. The resolution states: 'The Council of the City of New York calls on the MTA to make permanent the Access-A-Ride On-Demand E-Hail Pilot Program.' Council Member Nantasha M. Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Riley, Cabán, Brannan, and Hanif. The program, launched in 2017, lets people with disabilities and seniors book paratransit rides on demand, not days in advance. Ridership jumped from 7,386 to 22,372 monthly trips in one year. The council wants the MTA to expand access and improve service. The resolution centers vulnerable riders, demanding transit that meets their needs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A taxi traveling north with three occupants collided with a sedan also traveling north but making a U-turn. The point of impact was the taxi’s right front bumper striking the sedan’s left side doors. The report identifies 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor, indicating the taxi driver did not yield appropriately to the sedan. A 68-year-old male passenger in the sedan was injured, sustaining contusions and injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot. He was conscious and not ejected from the vehicle.

Vulnerable road users wait for relief.</p><p class=mb3>On November 8, 2024, State Senator Andrew Gounardes responded to Governor Hochul’s revised congestion pricing plan. The new proposal drops the peak toll from $15 to $9. The plan’s status is pending, with urgency to implement before a new presidential administration. Gounardes stressed, “It’s more important than ever that we start congestion pricing immediately, before Trump can block it.” The bill aims to fund the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan, but economist Charles Komanoff warns, “You don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.” The measure is meant to reduce traffic and improve transit, but the lower toll means less impact. The MTA has already paused $16 billion in work. The focus is on starting the program, but advocates note the diluted toll will not deliver the same safety and quality-of-life gains for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move aims to beat a federal block but guts traffic reduction. Streets will see less relief. The plan leaves vulnerable road users exposed. The city trades speed and safety for political timing.</p><p class=mb3>On November 8, 2024, Governor Hochul proposed lowering New York City’s congestion pricing toll from $15 to $9. The plan, a policy proposal to adjust congestion pricing, comes as officials rush to implement it before a new presidential administration can intervene. The original $15 toll, crafted by the Traffic Mobility Review Board and approved by the MTA Board, promised strong traffic reduction and included credits and caps. The $9 version, previously reviewed in environmental assessments, may lack those protections. Economist Charles Komanoff warns, 'You lose other benefits. Most noticeably, you don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes urges swift action, saying, 'The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now.' The lower toll is projected to improve traffic speeds by only 6.4 percent, far less than the 17 percent expected from the original plan. With less traffic reduction, streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The vehicle showed no damage. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle alone. The report does not list any contributing factors related to the pedestrian’s behavior.
