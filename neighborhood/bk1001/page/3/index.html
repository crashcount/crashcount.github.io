Nearly four hundred injured in the last year.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. In Bay Ridge, the violence comes steady—pedestrians, cyclists, riders, and children. No one is spared. In the last twelve months, 513 crashes tore through these streets. The dead: a 35-year-old, a 65-year-old, an 18-year-old. The living: left with broken bones, lost work, empty chairs at dinner.</p><p>A moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother said, &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did,&rdquo; as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>.

Gonzalez criticized New York’s laws, saying, 'The law is very restrictive in allowing district attorney’s to pursue murder charges in these types of cases.' He noted Yarimi’s 21 speeding and five red-light tickets did not trigger license points or insurance penalties. Gonzalez questioned why the NYPD cannot seize cars based on repeated violations and called for legislative change. He endorsed State Sen. Andrew Gounardes’s bill (S7621), which would require speed limiter technology for drivers with six or more automated enforcement tickets in a year, describing it as a way to fight 'violent car culture.' Gonzalez urged lawmakers to make it easier to prosecute and prevent reckless driving, centering the deadly risk to families and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One driver collected 563 speed-camera tickets in Sheepshead Bay; another, 474 in Manhattan. The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low.

It permits New York City to use speed cameras not just for speeding, but also to enforce against license plate obstruction, concealment, and distortion. The measure also extends speed camera enforcement in school zones. Gounardes leads the charge, aiming to close loopholes that let reckless drivers dodge accountability. The bill gives the city sharper teeth to catch those who hide from the law.

The bill would require speed-limiting technology for drivers with repeated offenses—those with 11 or more points in 24 months, or six camera tickets in a year. Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, citing the crash, demand action: 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair... it’s time for us to act.' The incident highlights gaps in enforcement and the stalled progress of safety legislation meant to curb reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers promise change.</p><p class=mb3>On April 1, 2025, Council Member Shahana Hanif joined a rally at Brooklyn Borough Hall demanding passage of the Stop Super Speeders bill. The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws. Some opposition remains, but supporters say the measure is urgent and practical.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, stalled for years in Albany, gained urgency after a fatal Brooklyn crash on April 1, 2025. Gallagher, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes and city Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied at Borough Hall, urging swift passage. The bill targets drivers with 11 or more license points in 24 months, or six camera violations in a year. Gallagher said, 'A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.' Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.' The legislation mirrors past efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act, aiming to hold reckless drivers accountable and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
