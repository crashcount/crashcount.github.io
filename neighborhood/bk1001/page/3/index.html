Twelve seriously injured.</strong> In Bay Ridge, from 2022 to June 2025, the road keeps taking. The dead include an 81-year-old man, a 74-year-old man, a 48-year-old woman, and a 24-year-old man. The list is longer than it should be. <strong>Over 1,000 people have been hurt in 1,764 crashes.</strong> The pain does not fade. It spreads—through families, through streets, through time.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed first.</strong> SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In the last year alone, four people died and 394 were injured in 520 crashes. Children are not spared—51 under 18 were hurt. The old are not spared—deaths at 65, 74, and 81. The young are not spared—deaths at 18, 24, 35. The numbers do not lie.

No new program has replaced it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the return of the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program.

He died there in the dark, alone, the road lit only by headlights and the hush before dawn.' The report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor. No driver errors such as 'Failure to Yield' or 'Distraction' are cited in the data. The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail appears after the description of the collision and is not listed as a contributing factor.
