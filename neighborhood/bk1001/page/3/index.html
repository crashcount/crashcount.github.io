Nearly four hundred injured in the last year.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. In Bay Ridge, the violence comes steady—pedestrians, cyclists, riders, and children. No one is spared. In the last twelve months, 513 crashes tore through these streets. The dead: a 35-year-old, a 65-year-old, an 18-year-old. The living: left with broken bones, lost work, empty chairs at dinner.</p><p>A moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother said, &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did,&rdquo; as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>. The driver was drunk and unlicensed. The passenger survived with fractures. The driver was arraigned and released without bail, at least for now.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks—these are the weapons.</strong> In Bay Ridge, cars and trucks caused the most pain: 3 deaths, 161 injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds: 6 injuries. Bikes: 1 serious injury, 10 more hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero. The city boasts of new laws.</strong> But in Bay Ridge, the carnage does not stop. Speed cameras work, but only where they are allowed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done so here. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders. No press conferences. No promises kept.</p><p>A brother waits for justice. &ldquo;We’ll see how it goes forth. Hopefully we get to be there for the trial, if there is a trial, and be able to talk on my brother’s behalf. But other than that, just on my behalf, there’s no hate,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>his brother told the NY Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every block. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another family to lose a son. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Gonzalez criticized New York’s laws, saying, 'The law is very restrictive in allowing district attorney’s to pursue murder charges in these types of cases.' He noted Yarimi’s 21 speeding and five red-light tickets did not trigger license points or insurance penalties. Gonzalez questioned why the NYPD cannot seize cars based on repeated violations and called for legislative change. He endorsed State Sen. Andrew Gounardes’s bill (S7621), which would require speed limiter technology for drivers with six or more automated enforcement tickets in a year, describing it as a way to fight 'violent car culture.'

It permits New York City to use speed cameras not just for speeding, but also to enforce against license plate obstruction, concealment, and distortion. The measure also extends speed camera enforcement in school zones. Gounardes leads the charge, aiming to close loopholes that let reckless drivers dodge accountability. The bill gives the city sharper teeth to catch those who hide from the law.

The street bore the weight of loss and metal.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (April 6, 2025) reports that Miriam Yarimi, driving with a suspended license for lapsed insurance, sped through a red light in Brooklyn on March 29. Her Audi struck a family, killing a mother and two small children. Police said Yarimi was 'reportedly speeding, ran a red light, and struck the family.' Prosecutors allege she told first responders she was possessed at the time. The article details Yarimi’s history as a victim of sexual abuse by a former NYPD officer, but the crash itself highlights systemic failures: a suspended license, unchecked speed, and a fatal intersection. The incident underscores persistent dangers for pedestrians and families on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
