But the wounds keep coming. In the last twelve months, 39 people were hurt in 73 crashes. Five of them were children. Not one week passes without someone’s body breaking against steel or glass. The numbers do not bleed, but people do.</p><p>SUVs hit more pedestrians here than any other vehicle. In three years, SUVs and cars left at least 30 people injured, including one with serious wounds. Buses, trucks, bikes, and mopeds all played their part. The pain is spread wide, but it is not shared equally. The most vulnerable—those on foot, on bikes, the young—carry the weight.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-routine-disaster>Recent Crashes: Routine Disaster</h3><p>On April 9, a 64-year-old woman was riding a bus on 31st Avenue. The bus and a sedan collided. She left with a bruised chest, lucky to be alive. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data records</a> the injury, but not the fear that lingers after.</p><p>A month later, a 24-year-old man on a motorcycle was hit by an SUV making a left turn. He left the scene with a fractured arm, partially ejected from his bike. The road does not forgive mistakes. It does not care who is right or wrong.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Local leaders have spoken for safer streets. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez and Council Member Tiffany Cabán backed the protected bike lane plan for 31st Street, writing it would <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>&ldquo;protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested&rdquo;</a>. The city says the design will move forward, despite business opposition.</p><p>But words are not enough. The lanes are not built yet. The crashes do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>Every crash here is preventable. Every injury is a failure of will. Call your council member. Demand the city finish the protected bike lanes. Demand more daylighted corners. Demand lower speed limits. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The street, a DOT truck route, lacks bike lanes. Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in western Queens in under three years. Former Councilmember Costa Constantinides called the area a 'serious safety risk' and urged the DOT to study improvements and reroute trucks.

Less than 1.5 percent of streets in Council District 22 have protected bike paths. Residents say the city prioritizes highway access over safety.

Chairman Janno Lieber said, "All good things can happen if people are willing to pay for them, or help figure out recurring funding sources, which is what MTA needs to achieve fiscal stability." New York City Transit President Richard Davey explained that peak hour service would be trimmed, with modest increases in wait times, while some weekend service would expand. Transit advocates and union leaders, including Richard Davis, condemned the cuts, warning of increased rider frustration and assaults on workers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani urged passage of bills to freeze fares and fill the MTA’s fiscal gap, stating, "We have to fix the rot at the heart of the transit system."

The proposal boosts bus service, freezes fares, and expands camera enforcement. They call it urgent. The plan aims to make transit faster, cheaper, and safer for all riders.</p><p class=mb3>On December 14, 2022, Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris introduced the Formula Three Act, a legislative proposal to overhaul MTA funding and fare policy. The plan, part of the larger Fix The MTA Package, would phase in free local and Select Bus Service, increase bus frequency by 20%, freeze fares, and expand permanent bus lane camera enforcement. Funding would rise from $200 million in 2023 to $638 million in 2026, with $488 million yearly for more buses and $300 million annually for frequent subways. Mamdani called the proposal 'urgent and necessary,' stressing that 'seniors, working class New Yorkers, people who use the bus the most are able to do so without fear of being priced out.' Gianaris said, 'incrementalism...is not working.' The lawmakers urge bold action to ensure public transit is accessible, affordable, and excellent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The push comes ahead of the next budget cycle. Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Amanda Septimo, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher led the call. Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warned that cuts or fare hikes would devastate working- and middle-class New Yorkers.

Drivers who block lanes face $50 fines. DOT backs the plan. Lawmakers say enforcement is needed. Cyclists face danger daily. Cameras promise real consequences for reckless drivers.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill, proposed June 2, 2022, by Zohran Mamdani (District 36) and co-sponsored by Brad Hoylman, seeks to deploy automated enforcement cameras at 50 protected bike lanes. The bill aims to fine drivers $50 for each infraction, targeting those who block or drive in bike lanes. The matter summary states: 'NYC pols propose traffic cameras to deter drivers from using bike lanes.' Mamdani and Hoylman argue that enforcement is critical, with Mamdani stating, 'You consistently see cars driving in the bike lane. We know that these cameras work to deter drivers from breaking the law.' DOT supports the measure, calling it 'life-saving automated enforcement technology.' The bill awaits City Council approval, with Mamdani pledging to advance it through the summer and fall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
