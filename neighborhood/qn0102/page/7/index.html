But the wounds run deep. Forty-two people were injured in 72 crashes in the past twelve months alone. Among them: children, elders, workers, neighbors. One crash, one body at a time. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><p>One person suffered a serious injury.

The streets remain a patchwork of risk.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy.

The fight for real safety continues.</p><p class=mb3>On August 17, 2023, Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) joined other officials in announcing a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard. The Department of Transportation's new plan, described as a 'compromised version,' adds protected bike lanes but keeps two car lanes during peak hours from Calyer Street to the Pulaski Bridge. The matter, titled 'Relief in Greenpoint as compromise reached on McGuinness Boulevard redesign,' reflects years of advocacy for safer streets. Restler, along with Borough President Reynoso and others, welcomed the changes and pledged to push for swift implementation. Advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe criticized the compromise as 'less effective and less safe,' blaming business opposition for watering down the original plan. The compromise marks a partial win for vulnerable road users, but falls short of the full road diet advocates demanded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Protected bike lanes will come, but car lanes stay open during peak hours. The plan falls short of full safety measures. The road remains dangerous. Victims still count. No one is satisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, Mayor Adams announced a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious Brooklyn corridor. The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Black and Latino city workers now shoulder more of the cost. Lawmakers like Mamdani call it unfair. Suburban interests win. City’s vulnerable lose. Racial disparity grows.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, state lawmakers finalized a payroll tax policy as part of the MTA funding negotiations. The measure raised the payroll mobility tax only for New York City businesses with high payrolls, exempting suburban firms after pushback from their legislators. The Fiscal Policy Institute found this move shifted the tax burden onto Black and Latino workers in the city. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani condemned the policy, saying, 'this illustrates the consequences of fiscal policy that privileges the suburbs over the larger MTA region.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll was one of the few to oppose the exemption. FPI’s Emily Eisner noted, 'there will be a 25-percent decline in the share of white workers impacted by the tax, and a 36-percent increase in the share of Black workers impacted.' Governor Hochul defended the plan as necessary to save the MTA. The bill’s racial and geographic inequity remains stark.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers and advocates say this will speed up buses and protect the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>The 2023 state budget, agreed on May 1, expands the MTA's automated bus lane enforcement camera system. The bill, backed by Governor Hochul and legislative leaders, broadens enforcement to drivers blocking bus stops, truck loading zones, bike lanes, intersections, and crosswalks. Fines start at $50, escalating for repeat offenses. The MTA will increase buses with cameras from 450 to 1,000 by year's end. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and advocate Sara Lind support the move, calling it vital for bus reliability and street safety. Lind says, 'Camera-based enforcement is such a powerful tool for making our streets safer.' The budget also addresses MTA funding, but some, like Mamdani, criticize the city's increased financial burden. The bill aims to clear the way for buses and vulnerable road users, reducing dangerous blockages.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
