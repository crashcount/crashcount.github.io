But the wounds run deep. Forty-two people were injured in 72 crashes in the past twelve months alone. Among them: children, elders, workers, neighbors. One crash, one body at a time. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><p>One person suffered a serious injury.

In the last three years, SUVs caused seven pedestrian injuries here. Taxis, sedans, and even bikes added to the toll. The young are not spared. Five children under 18 were hurt in the last year. The oldest victim was 74. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Vehicle breakdown</a></p><h3 id=leadership-progress-but-not-enough>Leadership: Progress, But Not Enough</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They tout new speed limits, more cameras, and intersection redesigns. But in Old Astoria-Hallets Point, the pain continues. No deaths is not the same as safety. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here. Cameras work, but only where installed. The streets remain a patchwork of risk.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every injury is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets built for people, not just cars.</p><p>Do not wait for the first death.

The measure, introduced February 28, 2024, urges that 'bicyclists treat stop signs as yield signs, and red lights as stop signs.' Council Members Julie Won (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, Tiffany Cabán, and the Brooklyn Borough President (by request) back the move. The resolution highlights that similar laws in other states have improved safety for all road users. It stresses that pedestrian rights remain unchanged—cyclists must still yield. The bill reflects a shift toward laws that recognize the realities of cycling and aim to reduce deadly car-bike conflicts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, Stanley Manel, was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Gonzalez, representing District 59, called for the state to pass stricter traffic laws targeting drivers with multiple school zone speed camera violations, noting Manel's history of speeding. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher joined Gonzalez, highlighting the lack of traffic calming on Nassau Avenue, where Aber was killed. Gallagher stated, 'Nothing to slow traffic on Nassau: no signal, stop sign, even a painted crosswalk.' The officials urged immediate installation of pedestrian safety measures and renewed calls for policy changes to protect vulnerable road users. The incident marks the first traffic fatality in Northern Brooklyn in 2024, underscoring systemic failures in street design and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their statement read, 'We’re calling on the New York State legislature to pass two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence.' They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections, and to convert Nassau and Norman avenues to one-way streets.

Mike Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani announced a $90-million proposal to expand bus service and the MTA's free bus pilot. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, became a public reckoning for Mayor Adams's transportation record. The matter: 'a proposal in Albany to increase bus service before congestion pricing begins.' Mamdani accused Adams of 'incompetence' and violating the Streets Master Plan law, which requires 30 miles of new bus lanes each year. Reporters pressed for answers on mayoral compliance. MTA CEO Janno Lieber praised Adams's past promises but noted the lack of progress. The mayor's spokesperson defended the administration, but data shows bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the lack of bus lanes leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic danger and slow, unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics argue the move is too late, as congestion pricing was approved in 2019. Some unions warn of possible driver shortages, but Mamdani insists existing buses and operators can handle the expansion. The funding proposal comes as the congestion toll faces lawsuits and could launch by mid-June.

The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On November 29, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams’s administration scaled back the Department of Transportation’s original McGuinness Boulevard redesign. The DOT’s first plan would have cut traffic lanes and added a parking-protected bike lane. Adams ordered a weaker version after business pushback. The compromise left two car lanes in each direction during the day. Elected officials—U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and Council Member Lincoln Restler—sent a letter urging DOT to restore the full safety plan, writing, “Nothing has been done to improve conditions for pedestrians.” Advocates say the new design increases crossing distances and leaves cyclists and pedestrians exposed. DOT says work will continue into 2024. The boulevard remains dangerous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers, including State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez (District 59), call for strict regulation of emissions from last-mile e-commerce warehouses. The bill would require environmental reviews for warehouses over 50,000 square feet, mandate plans to cut air pollution, and push for zero-emission delivery vehicles. Gonzalez said, 'The unchecked growth of large warehouses in neighborhoods across NYC has worsened air quality, noise pollution, and traffic safety for everyday New Yorkers.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, a co-sponsor, highlighted the link between warehouse traffic, pollution, and traffic violence. The Red Hook Business Alliance and community advocates back the bill, citing heavy truck traffic, poor air, and threats to safety in working-class neighborhoods. The legislation aims to hold warehouse operators accountable and protect residents from the mounting toll of delivery-driven pollution and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA pushes fare enforcement. Lawmakers and labor say focus on service, not punishment. Riders, mostly working class, depend on these buses to survive.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, highlighted on November 16, 2023, centers on bus fare evasion, free bus pilot expansion, and transit funding. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani (D-Astoria) leads the charge, arguing, "We are hitting numbers that we are not recognizing, because our focus has been on fares." The MTA claims fare compliance is vital, but Mamdani and union voices like JP Patafio of TWU Local 100 urge investment in service and affordability. The matter underscores the working-class reliance on buses and the stalled rollout of OMNY, which limits all-door boarding. The debate pits fare enforcement against calls for free or reduced fares, with advocates demanding progressive taxation to fund transit. No formal council bill or vote is attached, but the stakes for vulnerable riders are clear: service, not policing, keeps them moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Queens Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, mentioned in the coverage, said, 'Getting more New Yorkers on to public transit must be at the forefront of our plan for a greener NY.' The pilot covers the B60 in Brooklyn, M116 in Manhattan, Q4 in Queens, S46/S96 in Staten Island, and BX18 in the Bronx. About 44,000 weekday riders are affected.
