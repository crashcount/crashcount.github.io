Metal met flesh twice. Sirens and violence. The street offered no shelter. He left in critical condition. The city’s danger showed its teeth.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on April 29, 2025, that a man in the Bronx was critically injured after a road rage assault left him lying in the street, where he was then struck by a passing ambulance. The article states: “Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street.” The sequence highlights multiple failures: violent driver behavior escalated to physical harm, then emergency response vehicles encountered a vulnerable person in the roadway. The incident underscores gaps in street safety and emergency protocols, exposing risks faced by those left exposed on city pavement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
