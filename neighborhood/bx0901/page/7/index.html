Three dead. Ten left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In the last year alone, 432 crashes tore through these streets. One child, one elder, one man over seventy-five—all gone. A 75-year-old man was killed crossing Wood Avenue. He tried to wave the driver to stop. The driver did not. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-fatally-striking-75-year-old-man-walking-home-from-mosque/>“The accident is so terrible.

The driver left her in the road. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>“The moped driver sped away&mldr; leaving the young woman to die on the road,” police said</a>. Six others went to the hospital. The street does not forgive. It only takes.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-haunt>The Numbers That Haunt</h3><p>In three and a half years: 11 dead, 19 seriously injured, over 1,000 hurt. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—two deaths, 102 minor injuries, 34 moderate, six serious. Trucks and buses left 11 more broken. Motorcycles and mopeds, six more. Bikes, six. The young are not spared. One child killed, 101 injured.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—And What They Haven’t</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for safer truck routes, daylighting, and speed humps. She co-sponsored bills for school signs and speed reducers. She backed the SAFE Streets Act. But the carnage continues.</p><p>State Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install limiters. It is a step. But the dead do not come back. The wounded do not heal because a bill passed. No law yet has slowed the cars enough.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act or do not act. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
