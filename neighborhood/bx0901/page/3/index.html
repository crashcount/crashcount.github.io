Three people have died on these streets in the past year. Two were children or teens. One was over 75. 255 more were hurt. Six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</p><p>The dead do not speak. Their families do. After 17-year-old Juan Alexander Quizhpi Naranjo was thrown from his dirt bike and killed at Metcalf Avenue and E. 172nd Street, his father remembered the last time he saw his son: &ldquo;He was here yesterday morning, sitting on the bed and watching TV. I spoke to him last around 4 p.m.&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/25/dirt-bike-minivan-bronx-crash-juan-alexander-quizhpi-naranjo/>Bronx Teen Killed In Dirt Bike Crash</a>). The girl riding behind him survived. She will carry the crash with her.</p><p>A 75-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at White Plains Road. The driver turned left, did not yield, and struck him. The police called it &ldquo;failure to yield right-of-way&rdquo; and &ldquo;driver inattention/distraction.&rdquo; The man died in the intersection. The driver went home.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-young>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Young</h2><p>SUVs and trucks are the main killers here. In the last three years, SUVs killed two people. Trucks killed one cyclist. Cars and trucks together caused the most injuries and deaths to pedestrians and cyclists. Motorcycles and mopeds left more bodies and broken bones. Bikes, too, are part of the toll, but the weight of steel and speed does most of the damage.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the streets in Soundview-Bruckner-Bronx River have not changed. The intersection where Juan died is the same. The crosswalk where the old man fell is the same. The city says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; but the work is not done.</p><p>The NYPD says officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action. But the deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand cameras that never go dark.</p><p>Do not wait for another child to die.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
