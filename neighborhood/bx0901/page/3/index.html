Three dead. Ten left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In the last year alone, 432 crashes tore through these streets. One child, one elder, one man over seventy-five—all gone. A 75-year-old man was killed crossing Wood Avenue. He tried to wave the driver to stop. The driver did not. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-fatally-striking-75-year-old-man-walking-home-from-mosque/>“The accident is so terrible. I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” said a neighbor</a>.</p><p>An 18-year-old woman was thrown from a moped on the Hutchinson River Parkway. The driver left her in the road. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>“The moped driver sped away&mldr; leaving the young woman to die on the road,” police said</a>. Six others went to the hospital. The street does not forgive. It only takes.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-haunt>The Numbers That Haunt</h3><p>In three and a half years: 11 dead, 19 seriously injured, over 1,000 hurt. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—two deaths, 102 minor injuries, 34 moderate, six serious. Trucks and buses left 11 more broken. Motorcycles and mopeds, six more. Bikes, six. The young are not spared. One child killed, 101 injured.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—And What They Haven’t</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for safer truck routes, daylighting, and speed humps. She co-sponsored bills for school signs and speed reducers. She backed the SAFE Streets Act. But the carnage continues.</p><p>State Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install limiters. It is a step. But the dead do not come back. The wounded do not heal because a bill passed. No law yet has slowed the cars enough.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act or do not act. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill sits with the Senate, awaiting committee action. Its matter title reads: 'Establishes a bicycle and electric scooter operator's safety manual; provides for the issuance of a license...; requires liability insurance for electric scooters in cities having a population of one million or more.' Primary sponsor Luis R. Sepúlveda (District 32) and co-sponsor Joseph P. Addabbo Jr. (District 15) back the measure. S 5801 would require e-scooter riders in New York City to pass a safety manual, obtain a license, and buy insurance. It also bans sales to unlicensed, uninsured buyers. The bill's impact on vulnerable road users is not assessed. Lawmakers claim it will curb reckless riding, but the real effect on street safety remains unmeasured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
