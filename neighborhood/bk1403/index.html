A 73-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, killed by an SUV. A cyclist, 47, thrown from his bike, dies on Avenue O. In three years, four people have died on Midwood’s streets. Six more suffered serious injuries. The numbers are small until it is your mother, your son, your friend.</p><p>In the last twelve months alone, 170 people were hurt in 221 crashes. Four were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The young are not spared. Thirteen children injured, two with wounds called “serious” by the city’s cold ledger. The old are not spared. One woman, age 65, did not come home.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-families-pay>The System Fails, the Families Pay</h3><p>The carnage is not random.

They talk about speed cameras, lower limits, and safer streets. But in Midwood, the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. The state lets speed cameras go dark unless Albany acts. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No one in power moves fast enough for the dead.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action-not-excuses>What Next: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand the city use every tool it has.</p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The blood is on the street.
