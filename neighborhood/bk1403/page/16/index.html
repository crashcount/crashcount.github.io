The matter summary states, 'requiring the placement of temporary priority regulatory signs at intersections within one hour of a report of an inoperable traffic control signal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Julie Won, Kalman Yeger, and Justin L. Brannan sponsored the bill. The session ended with the bill filed, not enacted. Analysts noted that faster signage could 'significantly reduce the risk of pedestrian injury and vehicular collisions at intersections with malfunctioning traffic control signals.'

The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver.

The measure removed exemptions for gas, oil, and utility trucks. The matter summary reads: 'This bill would prohibit the parking of commercial vehicles owned or operated by gas or oil heat suppliers, gas or oil heat systems maintenance companies or any public utility in residential streets overnight.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Vickie Paladino, and Kevin C. Riley backed the bill. The council filed it at session’s end, on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst weighed in, but the bill’s failure means residential streets remain lined with large trucks, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
