A 73-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, killed by an SUV. A cyclist, 47, thrown from his bike, dies on Avenue O. In three years, four people have died on Midwood’s streets. Six more suffered serious injuries. The numbers are small until it is your mother, your son, your friend.</p><p>In the last twelve months alone, 170 people were hurt in 221 crashes. Four were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The young are not spared. Thirteen children injured, two with wounds called “serious” by the city’s cold ledger. The old are not spared. One woman, age 65, did not come home.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-families-pay>The System Fails, the Families Pay</h3><p>The carnage is not random. SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. In the last three years, cars and trucks took three lives and left dozens with broken bodies. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-deadly-crash-family-survived-accident-midwood-weekend-left-traumatized/16117277/>One crash in April 2025</a> left a family scarred, a mother and two daughters dead, and a survivor who <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-deadly-crash-family-survived-accident-midwood-weekend-left-traumatized/16117277/>described ongoing back pain and fears of another accident</a>.</p><p>The driver had 93 violations, $10,000 in unpaid fines, and a suspended license. She was still behind the wheel. The city let her stay there. The law let her stay there. The system let her stay there.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, lower limits, and safer streets. But in Midwood, the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. The state lets speed cameras go dark unless Albany acts. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No one in power moves fast enough for the dead.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action-not-excuses>What Next: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand the city use every tool it has.</p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The blood is on the street. It does not wash away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The 23-year-old e-bike rider was ejected and landed on the pavement, unconscious and bleeding from the head. The police report states the SUV’s right side bore the wound of the crash. The primary contributing factor cited is 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.' The report also notes 'Unsafe Speed' as a factor. The e-bike rider was unlicensed and wore no protective equipment, but these details are mentioned only after the driver’s errors. The crash left the cyclist with severe head injuries, underscoring the lethal consequences when drivers fail to yield to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Footage showed two vehicles sandwiched between the bus and truck, with one car stacked atop another. The injured included a 59-year-old MTA driver, a 33-year-old woman, and a 9-year-old girl. All were hospitalized in stable condition. The cause of the crash was not determined at the time of reporting.

No council bill number applies, but the saga unfolded across 2023 and 2024, with City Hall’s powerful aide Ingrid Lewis-Martin at the center. The matter: 'What role did a single bike lane play in Ingrid Lewis-Martin's undoing?' Lewis-Martin, Mayor Adams’s closest advisor, fought the road diet and bike lane, siding with Broadway Stages and its CEO Gina Argento, who opposed the plan. Under their pressure, Adams abandoned the Department of Transportation’s safety design. After both women’s phones were seized in a corruption probe, City Hall reversed course and advanced the safety project. The episode exposes how political interference delayed life-saving street changes, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The saga unfolded as City Hall, under pressure from Broadway Stages and its donors, repeatedly stalled or watered down the Department of Transportation’s plan to calm the deadly Brooklyn roadway. The matter’s summary: 'Under pressure from Broadway Stages, Mayor Adams abandoned his own Department of Transportation's plan to calm the notoriously dangerous Brooklyn roadway.' Despite neighborhood support and a history of fatal crashes, City Hall intervened, delaying life-saving changes. Bichotte Hermelyn appeared alongside DOT Commissioner Rodriguez at a meeting dominated by project opponents. The watered-down redesign, installed north of Calyer Street, did 'nothing' for pedestrian safety, according to local officials. The pattern: political influence trumped safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
