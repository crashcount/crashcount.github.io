Police said the driver, spotted near Brighton Beach, "maneuvered onto the service road in [the] direction of several officers who set up a roadblock to stop this vehicle." When the driver "veered toward one of the officers and nearly hit him," an officer fired, striking the driver. The car continued another mile before crashing again. The driver died at Brookdale Hospital. The incident was captured on police body cameras. Officers were treated at local hospitals but not injured.

The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low.

No students were on the bus at the time. The victims were hospitalized with serious injuries.
