A 73-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, killed by an SUV. A cyclist, 47, thrown from his bike, dies on Avenue O. In three years, four people have died on Midwood’s streets. Six more suffered serious injuries. The numbers are small until it is your mother, your son, your friend.</p><p>In the last twelve months alone, 170 people were hurt in 221 crashes. Four were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The young are not spared. Thirteen children injured, two with wounds called “serious” by the city’s cold ledger. The old are not spared. One woman, age 65, did not come home.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-families-pay>The System Fails, the Families Pay</h3><p>The carnage is not random. SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. In the last three years, cars and trucks took three lives and left dozens with broken bodies. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-deadly-crash-family-survived-accident-midwood-weekend-left-traumatized/16117277/>One crash in April 2025</a> left a family scarred, a mother and two daughters dead, and a survivor who <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-deadly-crash-family-survived-accident-midwood-weekend-left-traumatized/16117277/>described ongoing back pain and fears of another accident</a>.</p><p>The driver had 93 violations, $10,000 in unpaid fines, and a suspended license. She was still behind the wheel. The city let her stay there. The law let her stay there. The system let her stay there.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, lower limits, and safer streets. But in Midwood, the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. The state lets speed cameras go dark unless Albany acts. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No one in power moves fast enough for the dead.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action-not-excuses>What Next: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand the city use every tool it has.</p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The blood is on the street. It does not wash away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article quotes Councilmember Farrah Louis: "It appeared the driver was driving and hit the gas instead of the brakes, trying to avoid another car, and that's how he crashed." No students were on the bus at the time. The victims were hospitalized with serious injuries. Witnesses described the bus waiting for a pedestrian before suddenly jumping the curb and smashing through the fence. The incident highlights ongoing traffic dangers in the area and raises questions about driver error and the need for improved street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver had a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' according to State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The bill would require speed-limiting devices for drivers with repeated offenses, targeting those with 11 or more points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall to demand action. The article notes that auto deaths have outpaced gun deaths in New York City for two years. The bill mirrors laws for drunk driving and follows stalled efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act.

The matter, described as 'Notorious NYC road where wacky wigmaker Miriam Yarimi allegedly killed mom, 2 kids has dangerous history,' highlights a grim toll: 20 deaths since 2014, nearly 2,400 injuries since 2012. State Senator Simcha Felder, representing District 44, has opposed lowering the speed limit and even proposed raising it, despite calls from residents and advocates for stronger safety measures. Felder said, 'Some have wasted no time using this tragedy as an opportunity to advance their agenda. There is a time to act but there is also a time to mourn...' Mayor Eric Adams signaled openness to lowering the speed limit to 20 mph. Advocates push for speed cameras and mandatory speed-limiting tech for repeat offenders. Still, Ocean Parkway remains one of Brooklyn’s most dangerous roads for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Felder once blamed a dead cyclist after a fatal crash. The article states, 'Felder has a long record of opposing street safety measures, including Vision Zero, speed cameras, speed limits, and street redesigns.'

Novakhov argued, 'six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,' and claimed, 'any driver can get much more than six.' He also denounced speed cameras, saying, 'we have too many,' and that they punish regular drivers. The bill’s matter summary centers on requiring devices for vehicles with six violations in a year. Community members and advocates at the funeral demanded stronger accountability and cited the area’s deadly history. Other local politicians, including Kalman Yeger and Simcha Felder, have also opposed speed safety measures.
