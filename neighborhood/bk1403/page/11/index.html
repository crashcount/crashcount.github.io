They talk about speed cameras, lower limits, and safer streets. But in Midwood, the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. The state lets speed cameras go dark unless Albany acts. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No one in power moves fast enough for the dead.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action-not-excuses>What Next: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

It slashes the waiting period for new bike lanes from months to weeks. DOT backs the move. Advocates say delays cost lives. The bill puts safety over bureaucracy. The fight for safer streets continues.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 417, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, was discussed at a City Council hearing on April 26, 2023. The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the Council, 'We love Lincoln Restler's bill,' and called the old law 'unnecessarily burdensome.' The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster. Bike advocates and DOT say the change is vital to meet safety targets and reduce cyclist injuries, which drop by over 30 percent where bike lanes are built.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
