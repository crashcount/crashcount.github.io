A 73-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, killed by an SUV. A cyclist, 47, thrown from his bike, dies on Avenue O. In three years, four people have died on Midwood’s streets. Six more suffered serious injuries. The numbers are small until it is your mother, your son, your friend.</p><p>In the last twelve months alone, 170 people were hurt in 221 crashes. Four were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The young are not spared. Thirteen children injured, two with wounds called “serious” by the city’s cold ledger. The old are not spared. One woman, age 65, did not come home.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-families-pay>The System Fails, the Families Pay</h3><p>The carnage is not random. SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. In the last three years, cars and trucks took three lives and left dozens with broken bodies. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-deadly-crash-family-survived-accident-midwood-weekend-left-traumatized/16117277/>One crash in April 2025</a> left a family scarred, a mother and two daughters dead, and a survivor who <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-deadly-crash-family-survived-accident-midwood-weekend-left-traumatized/16117277/>described ongoing back pain and fears of another accident</a>.</p><p>The driver had 93 violations, $10,000 in unpaid fines, and a suspended license. She was still behind the wheel. The city let her stay there. The law let her stay there. The system let her stay there.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, lower limits, and safer streets. But in Midwood, the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. The state lets speed cameras go dark unless Albany acts. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No one in power moves fast enough for the dead.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action-not-excuses>What Next: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand the city use every tool it has.</p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The blood is on the street. It does not wash away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the Council, 'We love Lincoln Restler's bill,' and called the old law 'unnecessarily burdensome.' The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster. Bike advocates and DOT say the change is vital to meet safety targets and reduce cyclist injuries, which drop by over 30 percent where bike lanes are built.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
