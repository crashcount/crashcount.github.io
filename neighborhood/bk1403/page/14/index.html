The dispute, reported by nypost.com, began with Holden calling the plan 'another tax on hardworking New Yorkers' and demanding a referendum. Richards retweeted Holden, suggesting an 'actual Democrat' should replace him, and responded to a supporter with 'Yeah white supremacy.' The exchange escalated, drawing condemnation from other officials. The matter centered on the policy to charge motorists entering Manhattan below 60th Street. Holden joined a bipartisan press conference urging Governor Hochul to let voters decide. The spat revealed sharp divides over congestion pricing, with Holden opposing the plan and Richards defending it. No formal council bill or vote was involved, but the fight highlighted the political and racial tensions surrounding street safety and car use in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan targets neglected neighborhoods. It demands real infrastructure, not just paint. Advocates say it will open safe routes, cut danger, and connect the city.</p><p class=mb3>On October 27, 2022, the City Council passed a bill requiring a comprehensive master plan for New York City's greenways. The legislation, championed by Council Member Carlina Rivera and supported by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), mandates the city to study, map, and expand greenways—'highways for cyclists and pedestrians, separated from motor vehicle traffic.' The bill focuses on low-income and underserved neighborhoods, with a final plan due by December 2024 and updates every five years. Rivera said, 'All of us are here today because we believe in a future where New Yorkers of all backgrounds... can safely access active transportation.' Brooks-Powers called it 'a real opportunity... to make a profound impact.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York praised the move, urging the city to build 'real infrastructure for cycling.' The bill passed nearly unanimously, signaling strong council support for safer, more equitable streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by the New York Post, saw Yeger and others urge Governor Hochul to delay or cancel the toll. The matter’s summary reads: 'Zeldin hits congestion toll as cash grab as he cites MTA ‘waste’.' Yeger’s action was public opposition, alongside Rep. Lee Zeldin and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, who called the plan 'a war on cars.' The toll would fund $15 billion in transit upgrades, including new subway signals and trains. Without this money, the MTA’s capital plan faces a giant hole. No safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of transit investment risks more breakdowns and unsafe streets for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rally, covered by Crain's New York, featured lawmakers including Robert Holden, Kalman Yeger, Nicole Malliotakis, and Ritchie Torres. The group argued the plan would 'disproportionately harm working- and middle-class New Yorkers, increase air pollution in outer boroughs, and raise costs for businesses and consumers.' Borelli called it 'bad policy for New York City.' The event did not advance a formal bill but marked a public stand against congestion pricing. The MTA and Governor Hochul support the plan to reduce traffic and fund transit. The Traffic Mobility Review Board continues to review feedback.
