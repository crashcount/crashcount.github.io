The 18-year-old motorcyclist suffered fractures and dislocations across his body. The 50-year-old SUV driver sustained neck whiplash. Both were conscious after the crash. The report lists 'Turning Improperly' as the main contributing factor. The SUV's left front bumper hit the motorcycle's center front. The motorcyclist wore a helmet; the SUV driver used a lap belt. The crash resulted from the SUV driver's improper maneuver, not victim fault.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
