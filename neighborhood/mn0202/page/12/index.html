The aim: less noise, fewer health harms. Sirens will still clear streets, but without the shriek.

The bill, discussed in committee, would cap siren volume at 90 decibels and encourage use of vibrating, low-frequency siren technology. The matter title calls for 'mandating the use of hi-lo, "two-tone" sirens by emergency response vehicles.' Brewer wrote, 'the city should mandate that emergency responders use hi-lo as their default siren and cap sirens at 90 decibels—as required by the proposed legislation—and scale up their use of vibrating siren technology.' The bill seeks to cut the health harms of constant siren noise, which studies link to hypertension and heart disease.

The event, covered by nydailynews.com, focused on transit, congestion pricing, and infrastructure. The debate summary reads: “Transit issues like congestion pricing dominated part of the debate, with the candidates voicing broad support for Albany’s policy of charging drivers who enter Manhattan below 60th St.” Rivera supported congestion pricing but suggested possible incentives for electric vehicles. Other candidates called for exemptions and community input on infrastructure projects like the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. No formal safety analysis was provided. The debate highlighted broad support for policies that could shape city streets, but left the direct impact on vulnerable road users unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The grant, part of the federal RAISE program, aims to fix the city’s fragmented, poorly maintained greenways. Senator Chuck Schumer championed the funding, saying, 'We secured $7.25 million in funding from @USDOT to expand New York City's majestic greenway system!' Council Member Carlina Rivera stressed, 'New York City’s greenway system is currently a collection of fragments. We want to change that.' The City Council is considering a 'greenways master plan' bill to mandate completion and upkeep of the network. Jon Orcutt, Bike New York, called the grant 'foundational.' The money will not build paths yet, but it forces the city to plan for a safer, connected future for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law aims to slow cars, protect people, and keep streets safer for everyone.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul signed a bill extending and expanding New York City's speed camera program. The measure, sponsored by Assemblymember Deborah Glick (District 66) and Senator Andrew Gounardes, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7 in up to 750 school zones. The bill was set to expire but now runs through July 1, 2025. The matter summary states: 'New York City is now able to operate its speed cameras 24 hours a day.' Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children. The bill passed just before the legislative session ended, closing a deadly loophole in city enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more gaps. Crashes and injuries near schools drove the change. The law dropped tougher penalties, but sponsors vow to keep fighting. Streets stay dangerous. Cameras now never sleep.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul signed a bill expanding New York City's school zone speed camera program to operate 24/7, year-round. The bill, sponsored by Assembly Member Deborah Glick and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, was passed after statistics showed rising crashes and injuries near schools. The matter summary: 'The city's school zone speed cameras will now operate 24/7 year-round.' Hochul cited student deaths and the need for constant protection. Mayor Adams called the program a national model, noting, '72 percent of fatalities have been happening when the cameras were off.' The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns. Glick and Gounardes pledged to push for stronger measures. A separate bill to expand red light cameras failed. The new law closes deadly loopholes but leaves enforcement gaps for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
