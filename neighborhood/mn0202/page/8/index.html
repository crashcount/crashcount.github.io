Taxis, trucks, bikes, motorcycles: all part of the machinery. No one is safe. Not the old, not the young. Not the man crossing with the light. Not the cyclist just trying to get home.</p><p>A wrong-way driver fleeing police struck a cyclist on West Third. The man survived. The driver vanished. &ldquo;A wrong-way driver fleeing from police struck a bicyclist in Greenwich Village during a chase,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/18/bicyclist-struck-by-wrong-way-driver-fleeing-police-in-greenwich-village/>police said</a>. The city promises new pursuit policies. The pain remains.</p><h3 id=promises-and-delays>Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city touts Vision Zero. Lower speed limits. More cameras. But the blood keeps coming. <strong>Local leaders have the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it.</strong> Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. Every delay is another broken bone, another funeral.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets where a man on a bike can make it home. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024.

The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction.

It requires the city to identify at least one feasible off-street parking location for tractor trailers in each borough by the end of 2023, and to establish those sites by December 31, 2025. No location can be on a residential street. Council Member Kamillah Hanks sponsored the bill, joined by Brannan, Riley, Dinowitz, Ung, Brooks-Powers, and others.

The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers. Assembly Member Grace Lee said, 'They should be exempt from tolls under the congestion pricing plan.' The MTA has not taken a position on the exemption.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
