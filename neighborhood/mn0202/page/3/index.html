Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes.

If DOT misses the deadline, it must post notices explaining the delay and set a new timeline. DOT must also report yearly on compliance.
