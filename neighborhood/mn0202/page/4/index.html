The bill was introduced December 5, 2024, with Council Member Gale A. Brewer as primary sponsor and Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Julie Won, Julie Menin, Shekar Krishnan, Farah N. Louis, Chi A. Ossé, Nantasha M. Williams, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Carlina Rivera, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams as co-sponsors. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law in relation to the establishment of a task force to study options for making street design and infrastructure safer in consideration of increased use of electric bicycles and related collisions.' The committee laid the bill over on December 11, 2024. The task force, if created, must deliver recommendations for legislation and policy within 270 days. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, e-bike riders—remain at risk while the city studies its next move.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law orders DOT to publish every request for traffic signals and speed humps—case number, subject, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial, and timeline if approved. The public can now track what the city does, or fails to do, when streets need taming.

The pedestrian suffered a fracture, dislocation, and distortion to her knee, lower leg, and foot, resulting in serious injury. The report cites the driver's failure to yield right-of-way as a contributing factor, compounded by limited or obstructed view. The point of impact was the truck's right front bumper, which sustained damage. The driver was licensed and operating a 2018 Ford pick-up truck with two occupants. The pedestrian was conscious and injured at the scene. The report explicitly identifies the driver’s failure to yield and limited visibility as the causes, with no contributing fault attributed to the pedestrian.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to install e-bicycle battery stations," requires DOT to install at least 35 e-bike battery stations annually for five years. At least 25% will be curbside, allowing secure e-bike parking. Council Members Carlina Rivera (primary sponsor), Sandy Nurse, and Shahana K. Hanif back the measure. DOT must report on station locations and operations. The bill aims to carve out space for e-bike riders in busy corridors, forcing the city to track and share progress.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
