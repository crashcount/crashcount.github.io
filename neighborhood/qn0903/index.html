In South Richmond Hill, the numbers pile up. Four dead. Two hundred two injured. Since 2022, there have been 411 crashes. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians account for many of those injuries: 19 struck by sedans, 18 by SUVs, and 3 by trucks—sedans and SUVs cause most pedestrian harm; trucks and buses are a smaller share. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A crash is not an accident. It is a wound that keeps bleeding. &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; said Jacqueline Cox after a bus jumped the curb in Queens, injuring seven. The driver, 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb,&rdquo; and authorities now say he may have fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service; he will undergo testing, which the agency called standard. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York</a> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Joe Addabbo voted to extend school speed zones and to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member David Weprin voted against safer school speed zones for children. One vote makes a child’s walk safer; another vote leaves a family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><p>The city can lower speed limits and redesign dangerous turns. It has not done enough. The dead cannot wait for another study. The injured cannot wait for another hearing.</p><h3 id=local-fixes-that-work>Local fixes that work</h3><p>Make streets simpler to survive: install Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs) at dangerous crossings; harden left turns with protected phasing and curb extensions; daylight intersections by removing parking near corners and add speed humps on residential blocks. Pair those designs with targeted enforcement of high-risk behaviors at known hotspots.</p><h3 id=citywide-fixes>Citywide fixes</h3><p>Local evidence shows the same failures across neighborhoods: too-fast vehicles, dangerous turns, and repeat offenders. The city must lower NYC’s default speed limit and adopt speed limiters (intelligent speed assistance) for habitual speeders. Those are citywide policy fixes that will reduce speeds and cut deaths.</p><p>(For policy context, see File S 4045.)</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand 20 mph speed limits in neighborhoods and action against repeat speeders. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not forgive delay.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Schulman</p><p class=mb3>Bill 2025 to ban horse-drawn carriages in New York City remains stalled as of August 6, 2025. Sponsored by Queens Councilman Robert Holden, the bill sits in the health committee, chaired by Lynn Schulman. Speaker Adrienne Adams has not stated her position. The bill, described as a push to end the city’s carriage industry, gained attention after the death of a horse named Lady. Animal rights groups rallied, warning, 'Without a ban there will be more crashes in traffic, there will be more injuries and possibly deaths.' TWU Local 100 opposes the ban. Safety analysts note that removing carriages would cut unpredictable, slow vehicles from streets, reducing crash risk and making roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
