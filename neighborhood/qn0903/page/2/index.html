Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of New York, in relation to requiring bicyclists to wear protective headgear,' would require every cyclist not already mandated by other laws to wear a helmet. Violators face civil penalties up to $50. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Council Members Holden, Vernikov, Narcisse, Moya, Schulman, Louis, Hanks, Brannan, and Zhuang. The bill does not address the root causes of cyclist injuries: reckless drivers, speeding cars, and deadly streets. Instead, it shifts responsibility onto those most at risk, leaving the city’s dangerous roads unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA board is set to vote on the $9 toll to enter Manhattan’s business district, effective January 5. The matter, described as 'NYC congestion toll would hit neighborhoods with some of worst vacancy rates in city,' has drawn fire from both Republicans and Democrats. Rozic said, 'Affordability is really the most important thing that voters, that constituents, that people on the street, talk to us about... keep the pause.' Opponents argue the toll will worsen economic pain in areas with high storefront vacancy. Despite the uproar, the policy’s impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety remains unaddressed in this debate.
