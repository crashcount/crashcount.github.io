The case, filed in Manhattan, challenges the environmental review process and seeks to block the $15 daily toll for cars entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The lawsuit claims, 'the city, state, and federal government did not do the proper review to protect citizens.' Council Member Bob Holden called the charge 'insane.' The MTA defends its review and says delays threaten $15 billion in transit upgrades. Transit advocates say the lawsuit is frivolous and congestion pricing’s benefits are clear.

The editorial, titled "With politicians fearful of the TWU, a public referendum is the answer," criticizes the City Council’s failure to act on a bill that would replace horses with electric carriages. Schulman highlights that only 18 of 51 council members sponsor the bill, despite strong public support and past campaign promises. She names Justin Brennan, Gale Brewer, Julie Menin, and herself among those who have not advanced the legislation. Schulman blames union influence for the council’s inaction, citing 115 accidents and 27 horse deaths over decades. She calls for a citizen ballot initiative to bypass political gridlock and protect both horses and the public from ongoing street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code...in relation to towing vehicles that are an encumbrance on the street or that lack, improperly display, or obscure valid license plates, registration stickers, inspection stickers, or vehicle identification numbers.” Council Member Selvena N.

On May 22, 2023, Ari Kagan said, 'Congestion Pricing will hurt countless New Yorkers, small businesses, residents of so-called outer-boroughs & will create huge lines of parked cars right outside of Manhattan.' Yet, the MTA’s assessment shows only 5,200 city drivers commute by car from areas far from fast transit—just 1.2% of that population. Advocates like Felicia Park-Rogers counter, 'this policy has the potential to be utterly transformational for our city.' The plan includes exemptions for disabled and low-income drivers.

It was introduced April 11, 2023, and pushed by Council Member Shahana K. Hanif as primary sponsor, with Jennifer Gutiérrez and over twenty others co-sponsoring. The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ ... and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' The SAFE Streets Act package also includes safe passing for cyclists and complete street design mandates. The Council’s action highlights the city’s ongoing fight against reckless driving and the urgent need for stronger protections for people on foot, on bikes, and in cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city says it will consider changes.</p><p class=mb3>On February 23, 2023, the Transportation Committee of Queens Community Board 6 unanimously passed a resolution calling for a 'pedestrian-first redesign' of Austin Street between Yellowstone Boulevard and Ascan Avenue. The committee urged the Department of Transportation to study sidewalk widening, safer crossings, outdoor seating, and even pedestrianizing segments of the street. The matter title reads: 'Austin Street in Forest Hills should be transformed into a pedestrian paradise instead of the car-choked, will-sapping roadway it is today.' Pedro Rodriguez, a local advocate, pressed for urgent action, citing ongoing injuries and business impacts. Council Member Lynn Schulman did not comment. DOT spokesperson Vin Barone welcomed the board's support for Vision Zero and promised further discussions. From January 2018 to November 2022, 356 crashes caused 80 injuries on this stretch—most to pedestrians and cyclists. The board’s push aims to end the violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
