Fifteen more are seriously hurt. In just the last three and a half years, the streets of East New York (North) have not let up. There have been 2,264 crashes. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Children, the elderly, the working poor—no one is spared. In the last twelve months alone, 376 people were injured, five of them seriously. One did not make it out alive.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>On January 24, Janet Henriquez tried to cross Pennsylvania Avenue at Blake. She never made it. A Nissan Pathfinder turned left and hit her. She died at the hospital that day. The driver stayed. Three months later, police charged her with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/24/woman-arrested-in-january-car-crash-that-killed-57-year-old-woman-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;She was arrested Wednesday following a police investigation, and was charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian, and failure to exercise due care, cops said.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A few blocks away, a 55-year-old man was killed crossing Fulton Street. The driver did not stop. The car—a burgundy Ford Explorer—kept going. The man died at the hospital. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-fatal-hit-run-police-searching-driver-55-year-old-man-fatally-struck-car-cypress-hills/16447158/>&ldquo;Investigators say a burgundy Ford Explorer with Pennsylvania license plates struck and killed the 55-year-old man at the corner of Fulton Street and Washington Avenue in Cypress Hills as he crossed the street.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say every life matters. But the numbers do not move fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so here. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are made. Action is slow.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand action. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
