They say every life matters. But the numbers do not move fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so here. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are made. Action is slow.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand action. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the contributing factor, showing the driver failed to obey a signal or sign. No other contributing factors were noted. The data does not mention helmet use or signaling as factors. The crash highlights the danger when drivers ignore traffic controls and vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department parking enforcement," demands the NYPD confirm license plates and VINs on vehicles with temporary tags or those ticketed for violations. The NYPD must also release quarterly reports on parking enforcement. Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Oswald Feliz, Lincoln Restler, Robert F. Holden, and Chris Banks sponsor the measure. On April 28, 2025, the committee laid the bill over. The bill aims to expose enforcement gaps and bring accountability, but for now, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—see no immediate relief. The system stalls.

Council Member Lincoln Restler leads, joined by Salaam, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Banks, and Brannan. The bill would force drivers with eleven or more points in eighteen months, or six speed/red light camera tickets in a year, to install speed-limiting tech. The Council cites data: 265 killed, 52,949 injured on city streets in 2023. The measure aims to put a brake on reckless driving. The committee has not yet advanced the resolution.

The measure calls on Albany to let police list a car’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on a Notice of Violation when the license plate is missing, concealed, obscured, or distorted. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation to amend the vehicle and traffic law to permit a motor vehicle’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to be listed in a Notice of Violation, instead of license plate number, in circumstances when a license plate of such vehicle is missing, concealed, obscured, or distorted.' Council Members Chris Banks (primary sponsor, District 42) and Yusef Salaam (co-sponsor, District 9) back the bill. The law now demands a plate number on tickets, letting violators escape if plates are unreadable. The bill would let cops use the VIN, closing a loophole that shields reckless drivers from accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won and backed by 25 sponsors, aims to improve visibility and protect pedestrians. DOT officials opposed the measure, citing a study that warns of increased injuries without costly infrastructure, estimating a $3 billion price tag. Won called the study 'deeply flawed.' Council Member Lincoln Restler blasted DOT for ignoring dangerous corners in his district. Chris Banks opposed the bill over parking concerns. Advocates and Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla countered, pointing to cheap, effective daylighting elsewhere.
