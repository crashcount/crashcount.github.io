That is the only mercy. But the streets do not forgive. <strong>In the last twelve months, 89 people were hurt in 194 crashes</strong>. Three suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. Ten children were hurt.

It only takes.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The stories repeat. A 17-year-old boy on a bike, bleeding from the head, after a crash on East 198th Street. A 27-year-old man, crossing with the signal, struck at Grand Concourse. A 63-year-old woman, ejected from her bike, left with deep cuts. The details change.

It has not used it here.</strong> Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The law that keeps them on is set to expire. Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They talk about safer streets. But the numbers do not lie. The work is not done. The danger is not gone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every delay is a risk. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras.

Passengers and crash victims face tighter limits on payouts.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1050-2024 was introduced on September 26, 2024, and is now laid over in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to limiting the amount of liability coverage that the taxi and limousine commission may require for vehicles it licenses," bars the TLC from requiring more personal injury protection than state law demands. Council Member Diana I. Ayala is the primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors including De La Rosa, Banks, Ossé, Marte, and others. The bill was laid over by committee on February 10, 2025. The measure would take effect immediately if passed. By capping required coverage, the bill may leave crash victims with less compensation after collisions involving TLC-licensed vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It limits parking for tractor-trailer combinations, tractors, truck trailers, and semi-trailers to 90 minutes, down from three hours. Council Member Kevin C.

A moped, operated by an unlicensed and helmetless 41-year-old man, overturned and left its rider ejected and crushed, suffering injuries to his entire body but remaining conscious in the aftermath. The report states that 'Unsafe Speed' was a contributing factor. One sedan, an Audi driven by an unlicensed man, was engaged in a police pursuit and fled the scene. The violence of the crash is underscored by the report’s vivid description: 'Metal screamed. Glass rained.' The moped’s lack of safety equipment is noted in the data, but the central danger stemmed from driver actions—specifically, unsafe speed and a police pursuit. No evidence in the report attributes fault to the moped rider’s behavior beyond these systemic and driver errors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Enforcement rises.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State Assembly passed legislation to expand red light cameras from 150 to 600 intersections. The bill, steered by Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (District 83), marks a major shift in automated enforcement. The matter summary states: 'State legislators are expected to pass a dramatic expansion of red light cameras at New York City intersections.' Assemblymember Jeffrey Dinowitz said, 'People shouldn’t run red lights... when they do that they endanger other people’s lives, and people have died.' Heastie controlled the vote. A separate bill to ticket cars blocking street sweepers failed to reach the floor. Advocates pushed for both measures, but only the camera expansion passed.
