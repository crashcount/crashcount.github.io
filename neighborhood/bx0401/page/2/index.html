Nine hundred nineteen injured.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Concourse-Concourse Village since 2022. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. The pain does not end when the sirens fade. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> In the last year alone, 268 people were hurt. One lost their life. Children, teens, the old—all struck down. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. They kill. They maim. They keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-relentless>The Pattern Is Relentless</h3><p>The deaths do not come all at once. They come in slow motion. A 75-year-old woman, crossing with the light, killed by a sedan. A man in his seventies, crushed by an SUV. A pedestrian on the Major Deegan, struck and left dead. The pattern repeats. The street is a wound that never heals.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p><strong>What have leaders done?</strong> The city talks of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in this district, the blood still runs. The council and the mayor have the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it. The state lets speed cameras go dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a failure of will. The city can act. The council can vote. The mayor can sign. Residents can demand more. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>Act now. Demand action. Do not let the next victim be someone you love.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The collision involved a tractor-truck diesel and several SUVs traveling southbound. The primary contributing factor was 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' by one driver, who was changing lanes when the crash happened. This driver, a 60-year-old male, sustained back injuries and whiplash but was conscious and restrained by a lap belt and harness with airbag deployment. Two other occupants, including an 84-year-old female front passenger and a 50-year-old male driver of another SUV, were also injured with back injuries and whiplash. None of the occupants were ejected. The impact points included the left front bumper of one SUV and the right front quarter panel of the tractor-truck, indicating a side collision likely caused by the improper lane change.

The report states the child was crossing alone in the dark, far from any crosswalk, when the unlicensed driver hit him and did not stop. The police describe the child as suffering crush injuries to his entire body and dying at the scene. The driver’s license status is listed as 'Unlicensed' in the report, and the vehicle was traveling straight ahead. The police narrative makes clear the driver left the scene. No contributing factors are specified beyond the unlicensed status and failure to remain. The focus remains on the actions of the driver and the systemic danger posed by unlicensed, hit-and-run motorists on high-speed roadways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
