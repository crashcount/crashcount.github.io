Nine hundred nineteen injured.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Concourse-Concourse Village since 2022. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. The pain does not end when the sirens fade. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> In the last year alone, 268 people were hurt. One lost their life. Children, teens, the old—all struck down. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. They kill. They maim. They keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-relentless>The Pattern Is Relentless</h3><p>The deaths do not come all at once. They come in slow motion. A 75-year-old woman, crossing with the light, killed by a sedan. A man in his seventies, crushed by an SUV. A pedestrian on the Major Deegan, struck and left dead. The pattern repeats. The street is a wound that never heals.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p><strong>What have leaders done?</strong> The city talks of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in this district, the blood still runs. The council and the mayor have the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it. The state lets speed cameras go dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a failure of will. The city can act. The council can vote. The mayor can sign. Residents can demand more. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>Act now. Demand action. Do not let the next victim be someone you love.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure calls for redesigning streets to protect all users, not just drivers. The vote was not unanimous—several senators voted no, but the majority carried it through. The bill’s focus is clear: safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles.

The report states the woman was 'crossing with the signal' at the intersection. The driver was traveling at 'unsafe speed' and 'disregarded traffic control,' as cited in the contributing factors. The sedan was heading south and made no attempt to yield. The victim suffered fatal crush injuries to her entire body and died at the scene. The police report makes clear the driver’s lack of license and failure to obey traffic signals were central to the deadly impact. The victim’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted only after the driver’s violations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
