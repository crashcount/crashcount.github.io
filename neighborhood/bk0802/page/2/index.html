Since 2022, they have killed one person and injured 199 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed one, injured 13. Motorcycles and mopeds, seven injuries. Six more injuries came from bikes. The pattern is clear. The weight of steel, the speed, the blind corners—these are not accidents.

The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He proposes revising the city’s minimum pay law and making app companies liable for damages caused by delivery riders. His campaign website claims these changes will 'eliminate inappropriate incentives to dangerous use of e-bikes.' DoorDash donated $1 million to a Cuomo-aligned super PAC. Comptroller Brad Lander accused Cuomo of siding with app companies, saying, 'DoorDash is trying to buy Cuomo’s election...so he’ll roll back the law I passed that requires them to pay their workers a living wage.'

Myrie promises a 'year-round outdoor dining program' and restoration of open streets, citing safety and access for pedestrians and cyclists. Ramos calls the current scheme 'unworkable' and urges consensus. Lander faults City Hall for 'over-regulating' and vows to speed up applications while 'respecting pedestrian traffic.'

This means MTA employees, while driving official vehicles for work, would not face penalties for bus lane violations. Cunningham is the primary sponsor.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, featured Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Whitney Tilson. Stringer demanded 'massive expansion of protected bike lanes.' Myrie backed S1047, a bill for 50-percent e-bike rebates. Ramos called for safe bike lanes and clear signage for all riders. Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes. All agreed: safer streets need better design, strong enforcement, and real protections for workers and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation delays the project, likely until after the mayoral election. The matter summary states: 'a plan to improve street safety is on ice until NYC mayoral election.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and other Democratic mayoral candidates back the redesign. Brad Lander and Zellnor Myrie criticize the delay, calling out the Adams administration for broken promises.
