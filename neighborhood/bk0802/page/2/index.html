The driver stayed. The boy did not. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman</a>. Blood pooled on the street. Neighbors ran for towels. They tried to stop the bleeding. They could not.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, Crown Heights (North) saw 513 crashes. One person died. Three suffered serious injuries. Children are not spared. In the same period, 15 people under 18 were hurt. A neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said this street is dangerous</a> after the crash. The numbers do not flinch. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm. Since 2022, they have killed one person and injured 199 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed one, injured 13. Motorcycles and mopeds, seven injuries. Six more injuries came from bikes. The pattern is clear. The weight of steel, the speed, the blind corners—these are not accidents. They are the result of choices.</p><h3 id=leaders-promises-and-delays>Leaders: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Council Member <a href=/council-district/36/>Chi Ossé</a> and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/20/>Zellnor Myrie</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and redesign Atlantic Avenue. But the bills sit in committee. The deaths do not wait. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so citywide. Every day of delay is another risk.</p><h3 id=act-demand-action-not-excuses>Act: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand real protection for people, not cars.</p><p>The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is policy, inertia, and silence. Break it. Demand more.

Trains crawl. Riders stew. The fix promises faster, steadier service. Fewer delays. More trains. Streets breathe easier when subways run strong. The city waits for relief.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2025, the MTA unveiled its 2025-2029 capital plan, targeting the notorious Nostrand Junction subway bottleneck in Central Brooklyn. The plan, announced by MTA Construction & Development president Jamie Torres-Springer and supported by State Sen. Zellnor Myrie, promises to 'finally unclog a notoriously slow-rolling segment of the subway.' The project will keep express and local trains on their tracks, cut delays, and boost throughput from 44 to 60 trains per hour. Myrie said, 'I'm proud the MTA Capital Plan includes funding to finally un-cluster Crown Heights so more New Yorkers can get to work and school on time.' According to safety analysts, improving subway service can shift trips from cars to transit, reducing car traffic and risks for pedestrians and cyclists. The work is overdue.

The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The suit, joined by other state attorneys general, challenges an April 24 announcement by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that would cut off funding to states refusing to enforce federal immigration law or maintain diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The matter summary states, 'DOT’s blatant overreach threatens to divert critical resources away from public safety and undermine projects that keep our communities connected and safe.' James and her colleagues argue this policy forces states to choose between billions in infrastructure funds and supporting immigrant communities. They warn that withholding funds will halt vital safety projects, making streets and transit more dangerous. The attorneys general also note that immigrants may avoid reporting crimes if they fear deportation, further undermining public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, Andrew Cuomo, running for NYC mayor, made a campaign statement targeting 'delivery chaos.' He proposes revising the city’s minimum pay law and making app companies liable for damages caused by delivery riders. His campaign website claims these changes will 'eliminate inappropriate incentives to dangerous use of e-bikes.' DoorDash donated $1 million to a Cuomo-aligned super PAC. Comptroller Brad Lander accused Cuomo of siding with app companies, saying, 'DoorDash is trying to buy Cuomo’s election...so he’ll roll back the law I passed that requires them to pay their workers a living wage.' Other officials, including Scott Stringer and Zellnor Myrie, voiced doubts about Cuomo’s commitment to delivery worker protections. The bill is not in committee; it is a campaign proposal. The safety impact for vulnerable road users remains unclear, but the fight over pay and regulation leaves delivery workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the pedestrian was 'Crossing With Signal' at the intersection when the driver made a left turn and failed to yield the right-of-way. The woman suffered a knee and lower leg injury and was in shock. The driver, a 66-year-old man, was licensed and uninjured. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the crash. The vehicle, a 2023 Chevrolet pick-up, showed no damage.

The bill states: 'it shall be a defense to any prosecution for a violation of a bus lane restriction ... when an employee of the metropolitan transportation authority is performing authorized duties.' This means MTA employees, while driving official vehicles for work, would not face penalties for bus lane violations. Cunningham is the primary sponsor. The bill is not yet assigned to a committee or scheduled for a vote. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The measure creates a carve-out for transit staff, potentially affecting bus lane enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They called for more protected bike lanes, tighter rules on heavy e-bikes, and better delivery worker protections. Each pledged to cut car use and boost cycling. No one blamed riders. Streets remain dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, leading mayoral candidates aired their plans for e-bike safety and street reform. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, featured Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Whitney Tilson. Stringer demanded 'massive expansion of protected bike lanes.' Myrie backed S1047, a bill for 50-percent e-bike rebates. Ramos called for safe bike lanes and clear signage for all riders. Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes. All agreed: safer streets need better design, strong enforcement, and real protections for workers and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The mayoral race takes priority over safety.</p><p class=mb3>No bill number. The Sunset Park street redesign, approved by Community Board 7, is on hold as of May 8, 2025. The plan would cut traffic lanes and add protected bike lanes on Third Avenue, a corridor marked by high injury and fatality rates. The Department of Transportation delays the project, likely until after the mayoral election. The matter summary states: 'a plan to improve street safety is on ice until NYC mayoral election.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and other Democratic mayoral candidates back the redesign. Brad Lander and Zellnor Myrie criticize the delay, calling out the Adams administration for broken promises. Local business leaders are split. DOT claims to be gathering feedback. The delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
