Since 2022, they have killed one person and injured 199 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed one, injured 13. Motorcycles and mopeds, seven injuries. Six more injuries came from bikes. The pattern is clear. The weight of steel, the speed, the blind corners—these are not accidents. They are the result of choices.</p><h3 id=leaders-promises-and-delays>Leaders: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Council Member <a href=/council-district/36/>Chi Ossé</a> and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/20/>Zellnor Myrie</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and redesign Atlantic Avenue. But the bills sit in committee. The deaths do not wait. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so citywide. Every day of delay is another risk.</p><h3 id=act-demand-action-not-excuses>Act: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The bill sought to "prohibit the issuance of private vehicle parking permits and revoke such existing permits," with exceptions for people with disabilities and collective bargaining agreements. Council Member Christopher Marte led as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Brewer, Joseph, Nurse, Cabán, Avilés, Bottcher, Won, Ossé, and Richardson Jordan, plus the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aimed to end a system that let private cars claim curb space, fueling illegal parking and danger for those on foot or bike. It was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. The status quo remains: permits still shield drivers, while vulnerable road users face the risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) postponed its presentation on making the open street permanent after Hudson raised concerns. The matter summary states: 'implementation – especially the 'Limited Local Access' model – and communication... has been flawed.' Hudson, who has supported open space and pedestrian safety, now emphasizes community engagement, saying, 'Every voice, including dissenting voices, must be heard.' She suggests changes to better accommodate all residents. Data shows the open street is safer, with fewer crashes and more non-drivers using the space.

The matter, titled 'Brooklyn Pols: Fix Grand Army Plaza and Make it Safer,' calls for more protected bike lanes, speed bumps, improved traffic signals, and completion of stalled capital work. The councilmembers cited ongoing crashes, injuries, and community complaints about dangerous conditions. They requested a comprehensive traffic study and highlighted support from over 2,000 neighbors and local advocacy groups. DOT responded that it would review the letter and meet with the community. The push comes as past improvements have failed to end the threat to pedestrians and cyclists.

The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Curb extensions are designed to increase pedestrian visibility and reduce deadly conflicts at crossings, directly targeting systemic dangers faced by people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a 'police-involved traffic fatality and official response,' has drawn sharp criticism. Julie Floyd, Smith’s sister, demands the officers be fired, stating, 'If one of us runs a red light... there's a risk of us getting shot.' Council Member Crystal Hudson echoed the call for termination. The NYPD has not commented, only placing the driver on modified duty. The state Attorney General’s office is also investigating, as required in police-involved deaths. Vehicle crashes, especially those involving NYPD, drive up city settlement costs. The case spotlights the lack of police accountability in traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
