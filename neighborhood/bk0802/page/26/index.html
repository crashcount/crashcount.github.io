The Civilian Complaint Review Board found the officer abused his authority.</p><p class=mb3>On June 30, 2022, State Senator Zellnor Myrie testified at an NYPD disciplinary hearing for Officer Michael Kovalik, a member of the Strategic Response Group. The hearing followed a Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) investigation, which found Kovalik abused his authority by threatening Myrie and others with pepper spray during a protest on May 29, 2020. The matter centered on 'excessive use of force with department-issued bikes' and the officer's actions at a protest outside Barclays Center after George Floyd's murder. Myrie, detained with zip ties, said, 'I felt what felt like bike tires on my back and on my arms.' He described lasting trauma from the incident. The CCRB prosecutor, Andre Applewhite, argued video evidence confirmed the threats. Myrie and another lawmaker have filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD. The case highlights the dangers faced by peaceful protesters and the use of police bicycles as tools of force.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Zellnor Myrie sponsored a New York law enabling lawsuits against gun manufacturers for dangerous marketing or sales practices. The law, recently upheld in court, lets victims like Ilene Steur—injured in the Sunset Park subway shooting—sue Glock. The bill challenges federal PLCAA protections that shield gun companies. Myrie says, 'Bad actions by industries...are often forced to change their practices by way of litigation.' He insists, 'This isn’t about anyone coming after your legally possessed guns...The guns are killing my people.' The law is not about targeting legal gun owners, but about holding companies accountable when their products fuel violence. Gun industry groups are fighting the law, but for now, it stands. Myrie’s push is clear: force the industry to act or get out of New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
