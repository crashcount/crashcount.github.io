A 39-year-old man crossing Atlantic Avenue. A cyclist, age 37, thrown from his bike. In Crown Heights (North), the names fade but the numbers do not. <strong>Eight people have died on these streets since 2022.</strong> More than 1,200 have been hurt.

Motorcycles and mopeds struck two more. Not a single cyclist killed anyone, but one cyclist died. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are not in your favor.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They count deaths and promise less. They passed Sammy’s Law. They say they will lower the speed limit to 20 mph. But the limit stands. The clock runs. <strong>Promises do not slow a car.</strong></p><p>Speed cameras work. They cut speeding by more than half where installed. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Albany debates. The city waits. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward>The Path Forward</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by a city that could do more. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people on foot and bike. Keep the cameras on. Do not let another child die while leaders talk.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Residents want the city to act now.</p><p class=mb3>On November 14, 2023, the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council released a survey showing none of the neighborhood’s 54 intersections meet state daylighting standards. The group, led by Gib Veconi, demands the Adams administration finish the Underhill Avenue bike boulevard and support the Vanderbilt Avenue open street. Council Member Crystal Hudson called for daylighting all intersections within a half-mile of a school, covering all 54 intersections. The matter summary states, 'No intersections in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, are clear of parked cars as required under state law.' Veconi and the council cite recent pedestrian deaths, including a 7-year-old killed by an NYPD tow truck driver whose view was blocked by parked cars. The mayor’s office has delayed safety projects, citing outreach concerns. Residents and advocates say the city’s exemption from state daylighting law leaves streets unsafe, with 180 crashes and 75 injuries reported this year. They urge City Hall to act before another tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City Hall defends its record.</p><p class=mb3>This controversy centers on Mayor Eric Adams’ street safety record following the fatal crash that killed 7-year-old Kamari Hughes in Council District 35. The incident, reported on November 3, 2023, highlights Adams’ reversal on key safety policies, including ending the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program and abandoning a planned bike lane on Ashland Place. The Department of Transportation briefly removed a car-free Open Street in Fort Greene, a move traced to City Hall. Councilmember Crystal Hudson, representing District 35, criticized the administration for failing to fill 483 vacant crossing guard positions and for lax speeding enforcement, stating her precinct has 'a long waiting list and not enough crossing guards.' Despite Adams’ claims of 1,000 street redesigns and ongoing efforts, the administration has missed City Council-mandated goals for protected bike and bus lanes. Cycling deaths are at their highest since 2014. DOT touts a record low in pedestrian fatalities and daylighting redesigns, but residents and Hudson say many intersections remain unsafe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents demanded speed bumps and crossing guards. The crash came as the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and crossing guard positions were cut.
