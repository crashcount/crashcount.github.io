Since 2022, they have killed one person and injured 199 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed one, injured 13. Motorcycles and mopeds, seven injuries. Six more injuries came from bikes. The pattern is clear. The weight of steel, the speed, the blind corners—these are not accidents.

The district faces high crash rates and weak safety measures.</p><p class=mb3>On October 26, 2023, a 7-year-old boy was killed by an NYPD tow truck driver in Brooklyn. The crash happened near Fort Greene Park, where witnesses reported the driver was speeding, using her phone, and dragged the child before stopping. The intersection’s visibility was blocked by a legally parked car, as New York City exempts itself from state daylighting rules. Council Member Crystal Hudson visited the scene, spoke with police and residents, and acknowledged a pattern of reckless tow truck driving. Hudson said, 'This is the worst possible outcome, and, yet, we are forced to reckon with the worst possible outcome at the hands of the NYPD all too often.' Residents demanded speed bumps and crossing guards. The crash came as the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and crossing guard positions were cut. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for an end to 'senseless traffic violence.' The district has a high rate of crashes and a history of resistance to safety improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It called on the State Legislature and Governor to create unlimited transfers within two hours for MTA pay-per-ride users. The resolution was introduced October 19, 2023, and filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation, which would create unlimited transfers within the two-hour period of paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority subway or bus fare for pay-per-ride users.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Jennifer Gutiérrez, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, and Kevin C. Riley. The bill targeted fare burdens on riders with long, complex trips, who now pay more than those with direct routes.

At a town hall, Hudson called herself a neutral arbiter, saying, 'My record of supporting and delivering tangible results that make our streets safer and more accessible to cyclists, pedestrians, and all New Yorkers speaks for itself.' She criticized city outreach but did not commit to defending threatened projects. Hudson has co-sponsored Int. 965 for protected bike lanes and funded safety on Flatbush Avenue and Vanderbilt Avenue Open Streets. Still, advocates and residents launched a petition, demanding she take a clear stand.

State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety.

Volunteers could not keep cars out. Traffic returned. No city program replaced it. The street lost its safe space. Neighbors mourned. The city moved on.</p><p class=mb3>On October 2, 2023, the closure of the South Portland Avenue open street in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, was reported. The NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) ended contractor support in spring 2023, citing a shift of resources to higher-need areas and the street's ineligibility for the Public Space Equity Program. The matter summary states, 'A block-long "open street"...ended in spring 2023 after the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) reassigned its contractor elsewhere.' Council Member Crystal Hudson did not comment on the closure. Volunteers, including Phillip Kellogg, Brian Blessinger, and Mike Lydon, voiced frustration and burnout, highlighting the failure of relying on unpaid labor for public safety. No significant local opposition existed. The loss underscores the need for permanent city-backed programs to protect vulnerable road users and maintain safe, car-free spaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move aims to cut deadly conflict between cars and kids. Filed at session’s end, the resolution targets peak arrival and dismissal. Sponsors push Albany to act. Streets remain risky.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0792-2023 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 28, 2023, and closed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction. The council’s action highlights the ongoing danger children face on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed for over ten years, aims to transform Atlantic Avenue from a car-dominated corridor into a safer, mixed-use area. The report, described as 'exhaustive' by Council Member Crystal Hudson, highlights community demands for deeply affordable housing, safer streets, and better infrastructure. Hudson stated, 'the community surrounding Atlantic Avenue has called for a new vision for this dangerous corridor.' The plan identifies needs like bike boulevards, raised crosswalks, and wider sidewalks. However, the Department of Transportation raised concerns about protected bike lanes due to truck traffic. The rezoning process is set to begin, but major safety changes remain years away.
