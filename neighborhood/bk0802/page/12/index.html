Introduced March 7, 2024, it urges the MTA to make any subway station undergoing enhancement or renovation fully accessible to people with disabilities. The matter title is clear: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make any subway stations undergoing enhancement or renovation fully accessible to people with disabilities.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The resolution responds to a system where only 117 of 493 stations are accessible. It follows a federal court ruling that found the MTA violated the ADA by skipping elevator installation during renovations. The sponsors demand the MTA use every renovation as a chance to fix this injustice.

The bill demands public reports on towing and pound use. Lawmakers say this deters illegal driving. The committee stalled the bill. Streets stay risky for walkers and riders.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0179-2024 sits with the Committee on Public Safety. It was introduced on February 28, 2024, and laid over in committee on April 28, 2025. The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department tow pound capacity.' Council Members Kamillah Hanks (primary sponsor), Oswald Feliz, Robert F. Holden, Farah N. Louis, Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, Mercedes Narcisse, and Amanda Farías co-sponsored. The bill would force the NYPD to run tow pounds with enough space to tow cars at a rate that deters illegal conduct. It also requires public reports on tow pound capacity and towing in response to traffic violations. The committee has not advanced the bill. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more hiding behind vague reports. The city must count each incident. Data will show the toll. Vulnerable New Yorkers deserve the truth.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0255-2024 sits in the Committee on Public Safety after introduction on February 28, 2024. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle," forces the NYPD to add 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a specific reporting category in quarterly and annual use of force reports. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Won, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Avilés, Abreu, Ossé, Krishnan, Williams, Cabán, Nurse, Sanchez, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force. This change brings police violence by car into the light, exposing patterns that endanger pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Rita C. Joseph leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, Louis, Bottcher, Hudson, Gennaro, and Williams. The bill authorizes the mayor, on the police commissioner's recommendation, to offer up to $1,000 for actionable tips. Law enforcement and city or state employees are excluded.
