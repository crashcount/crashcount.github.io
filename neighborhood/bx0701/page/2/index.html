In the last twelve months, <strong>two people have died and 254 have been injured</strong> in crashes here. One was a 65-year-old man, struck and killed by a van while crossing with the signal. A child, just four, died after being ejected in a moped crash. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-slow-grind-of-policy>The Slow Grind of Policy</h3><p><strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> In the past year, there were 369 crashes in University Heights (North)-Fordham. One person suffered a serious injury. The rest were luckier, or not. The city says it is working. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. The police say they are visible. But the street does not care about words. It cares about speed, steel, and flesh.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders day and night. But change is slow. The law is on the books, but the street is not yet safer. “NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>said Police Commissioner Edward Caban</a>. But the dead do not see police lights.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Lower the speed. Harden the crossings. Build the lanes. Hold drivers accountable. The city has the power. The council has the vote. The mayor has the pen. The only thing missing is the will.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and real protection for people on foot and bike.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not wait. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article states, "NYPD sources said the two officers in pursuit returned to their stationhouse without reporting the crash." The FDNY later found Guzman Parra dead in the burning car. Patrick Hendry of the Police Benevolent Association claimed officers "lost sight of the car and did not know it crashed," but the family's attorney, Jeremy Feigenbaum, said their investigation "has not corroborated the officers' claim." The officers remain on leave as both the NYPD and the New York attorney general's office investigate.

Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes.
