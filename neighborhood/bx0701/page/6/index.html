His car won’t start. He calls friends for help. A Mercedes slams into him from behind. The driver runs. The man, Darryl Mathis Jr., calls again. “I can’t breathe,” he says. His friends call the ambulance. He dies at St. Barnabas Hospital. The driver is gone. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>“He called to get a jump, and after that, he got hit from behind, a hit-and-run. They were on their way to come give him a jump and he got hit waiting for them. And then he called to let them know, I&rsquo;ve been hit. I can&rsquo;t breathe.”</a></p><p>He is not the only one. In the last twelve months, <strong>two people have died and 254 have been injured</strong> in crashes here. One was a 65-year-old man, struck and killed by a van while crossing with the signal. A child, just four, died after being ejected in a moped crash. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-slow-grind-of-policy>The Slow Grind of Policy</h3><p><strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> In the past year, there were 369 crashes in University Heights (North)-Fordham. One person suffered a serious injury. The rest were luckier, or not. The city says it is working. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. The police say they are visible. But the street does not care about words. It cares about speed, steel, and flesh.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders day and night. But change is slow. The law is on the books, but the street is not yet safer. “NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>said Police Commissioner Edward Caban</a>. But the dead do not see police lights.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Lower the speed. Harden the crossings. Build the lanes. Hold drivers accountable. The city has the power. The council has the vote. The mayor has the pen. The only thing missing is the will.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and real protection for people on foot and bike.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not wait. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Members Alexa Avilés (primary sponsor), Shaun Abreu, Farah N. Louis, Rafael Salamanca, Jr., Lincoln Restler, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Sandy Nurse, Selvena N.

Streets shift from danger to refuge, if the city acts.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0270-2024 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 28, 2024, it amends city law to require the Department of Transportation to expand Open Streets hours on holidays with heavy foot traffic. The bill’s summary reads: 'special activation of the Open Streets program on certain holidays and time periods with significant pedestrian traffic.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Brooks-Powers, Louis, Nurse, Ossé, Sanchez, Cabán, Banks, Avilés, Riley, Salaam, Hanif, Feliz, Won, Restler, and Joseph. The bill directs DOT to seek community input for more activation days. Applications for these special activations follow the same review as regular Open Streets. The measure aims to give pedestrians and cyclists more space and time, cutting car risk when crowds surge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Three people were injured: a 41-year-old front passenger, a 48-year-old driver with neck pain and nausea, and a 33-year-old driver. All suffered shock. The report cites alcohol involvement and traffic control disregarded as contributing factors. The sedan was parked before impact; one SUV traveled north, the other south. The vehicles sustained damage to bumpers and quarter panels. Driver errors—alcohol impairment and ignoring traffic controls—are explicitly listed. No victim actions contributed. The crash exposes the persistent threat of impaired, reckless driving on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
