They do not care if you are young or old. In the last twelve months, <strong>sixty-six people were hurt</strong> on these streets. Not one was spared a serious injury. But pain does not need a label to be real.</p><p>Children walk to school. Elders cross with the light.

A 66-year-old man, hit in the head while crossing at the light. A 35-year-old cyclist, killed by a garbage truck. The stories repeat.

The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year.
