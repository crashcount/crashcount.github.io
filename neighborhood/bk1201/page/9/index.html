They do not care if you are young or old. In the last twelve months, <strong>sixty-six people were hurt</strong> on these streets. Not one was spared a serious injury. But pain does not need a label to be real.</p><p>Children walk to school. Elders cross with the light.

A 66-year-old man, hit in the head while crossing at the light. A 35-year-old cyclist, killed by a garbage truck. The stories repeat.

Residents breathe exhaust.</p><p class=mb3>On February 16, 2023, Council Member Alexa Avilés (District 38) led a legislative push to regulate last-mile warehouses. The bill, now before the council, seeks to amend zoning laws to require special permits for new facilities. The measure aims to stop warehouse clustering near schools, parks, and homes, and mandates studies on truck traffic and air quality. The proposal, described as a response to 'an epidemic of truck traffic,' targets companies like Amazon whose rapid delivery model floods streets with trucks. Avilés declared, 'This is environmental racism. Last-mile facilities follow the same pattern, dumping environmental burdens on low-income communities of color.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez joined, demanding companies 'be responsible, take our communities into account so that we can breathe cleaner air.' The Adams administration expressed concern about economic impacts but supports electrification and cargo bike incentives. The bill awaits committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to require the Department of Transportation to allow special Open Streets activations on holidays with heavy foot traffic—Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Halloween, and others. The matter summary reads: 'special activation of the Open Streets program on certain holidays and time periods with significant pedestrian traffic.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan led as primary sponsor, joined by Julie Menin, Farah N. Louis, Julie Won, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Alexa Avilés, Lincoln Restler, Shahana K. Hanif, and Rita C. Joseph. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. No safety analyst note was provided. The bill’s failure leaves vulnerable road users at risk during the city’s busiest days.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT’s proposal, which included one-way conversions, protected bike lanes, and expanded sidewalks, stalled after business opposition and a lawsuit. Following a crash that injured two young girls, DOT revived the plan but removed the Eighth Avenue bike lane. Aviles criticized DOT’s outreach, saying, 'the city could do better' and called for 'robust, accessible community engagement,' especially for Chinese-speaking residents. She urged DOT to finish promised safety work, prioritize pedestrian safety over business interests, and not rush the process. Aviles supported curb extensions, traffic calming, and one-way conversions if paired with real safety measures. She demanded urgent, compassionate action to protect vulnerable road users and insisted that community voices—not business parking—must guide street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Trucks choke Red Hook and Sunset Park. Narrow streets shake. Residents breathe fumes. The bill demands safer, smarter routes. Data and daylighting aim to protect people, not just freight.</p><p class=mb3>On September 30, 2022, Council Member Alexa Avilés (District 38) introduced a package of bills targeting last-mile trucking regulation. The measures, revived in committee, seek to redesign truck routes and gather data on facilities run by Amazon, FedEx, and UPS. The matter aims to 'reduce congestion and emissions, improve safety and increase visibility,' especially in overburdened neighborhoods like Red Hook and Sunset Park. Avilés, the lead sponsor, calls for systematic changes: 'We really need to look systematically at more improved routes to ensure people are safe.' The bills would require the Department of Transportation to daylight intersections and the Department of Environmental Protection to install air monitors on heavy-use roads. Councilwoman Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsors a related bill for public truck-route data. The legislation draws support from industry and advocates, all seeking safer streets and cleaner air for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0721-2022 was introduced to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 29, 2022. The bill required the Department of Transportation to study truck drivers’ compliance with city truck routes and to assess integrating truck maps with GPS technology. The matter’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a truck route GPS study.' Alexa Avilés sponsored the bill, joined by Gutiérrez, Hanif, Restler, Brooks-Powers, Hudson, Krishnan, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill called for measures like converting two-way streets to one-way, posting truck route signs, and outreach to the trucking industry. The study’s results were to be posted online and sent to the council by January 1, 2023. The bill was filed at session’s end, with no further action. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
