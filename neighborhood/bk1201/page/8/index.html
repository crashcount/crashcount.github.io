They do not care if you are young or old. In the last twelve months, <strong>sixty-six people were hurt</strong> on these streets. Not one was spared a serious injury. But pain does not need a label to be real.</p><p>Children walk to school. Elders cross with the light.

A 66-year-old man, hit in the head while crossing at the light. A 35-year-old cyclist, killed by a garbage truck. The stories repeat.

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in a council hearing, aims to address safety and environmental justice. The matter summary states DOT must redesign routes to reduce truck traffic in low-income communities of color, where trucks bring pollution, congestion, and road violence. DOT’s Eric Beaton admitted, 'The current situation is already problematic... We want fewer truck miles on our streets.' Aviles, at a City Hall rally, said, 'We must take action.' Advocates like StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure called for strict enforcement and a ban on 53-foot trailers. The Trucking Association of New York supports the redesign and daylighting. The bill responds to a deadly trend: trucks killed 42 people in 2022, with most injuries on truck routes.

The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns.

Advocates demand action as trucks flood low-income streets. Delayed studies, rising injuries, and pollution haunt neighborhoods. The bills seek new street designs, maritime shipping, and tighter zoning. City promises change. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On February 16, 2023, Council Member Alexa Aviles introduced three bills in the New York City Council to address the unchecked growth of last-mile delivery facilities. The bills, not yet passed or assigned a committee, require the city to study truck and delivery traffic, explore street design changes to limit commercial vehicles in residential areas, and consider maritime shipping alternatives. The matter summary states: 'Pols and advocates are demanding that New York City crack down on last-mile distribution facilities, which are proliferating in low-income communities of color and bringing increased truck traffic, emissions, and dangerous streets.' Aviles, joined by other council members and community advocates, criticized the city’s inaction and highlighted the toll on neighborhoods: delayed traffic studies, rising fatalities, and environmental harm. The coalition calls for a special permit process and zoning reforms to protect vulnerable residents from truck-related danger and pollution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
