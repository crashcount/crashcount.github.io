Since 2022, one person has died and 237 have been injured in traffic crashes in Sunset Park (East)-Borough Park (West). No one is spared: children, elders, workers, neighbors. In the last year alone, 63 people were hurt—none killed, but pain is not measured only in funerals. A 16-year-old girl, crossing with the light, was struck by a sedan. A 66-year-old man, walking with the signal, was hit by a turning car. The numbers do not flinch: most injuries come from cars and SUVs. The wounds are real. The silence is not safety.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>On July 2, a 27-year-old man was hit by a bus while crossing at 9th Avenue and 39th Street. He left with torn skin and shock, crossing with the signal. On May 2, a teenage girl was bruised by a sedan while walking with the right of way. The driver failed to yield. The street did not care. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>. The grief does not fade. The tire marks remain.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps, but the pace is slow. Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>co-sponsored bills</a> to hold reckless drivers accountable and to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>daylight intersections</a> with real barriers, not just paint. Council Member Alexa Avilés backs a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/06/advocates-to-dot-end-all-parking-at-t-intersections>ban on parking near crosswalks</a>. But the carnage continues. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Votes against speed cameras and safer school zones</a> by others—like Assembly Member Lester Chang—leave the most vulnerable exposed. The city has the power to lower speed limits and redesign streets. The question is not what can be done, but why it is not done faster.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a failure of will. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real daylighting. Demand that every child, every elder, every neighbor can cross the street and come home. The blood on the asphalt is not an act of God. It is a choice. Make them choose safety.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.'
