One serious injury. Eighty-five hurt in the last year.</strong> These are not numbers. They are people from Glen Oaks-Floral Park-New Hyde Park. A 67-year-old man struck and killed by an SUV on 73rd Avenue. A child, age one, left with head injuries. A five-year-old girl, blood on her face, not far from home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash data does not blink</a>.</p><p><strong>In the past twelve months, 153 crashes.</strong> No one walks away unchanged. The old, the young, the in-between. The street does not care. The SUV does not yield. The sedan does not slow. The body breaks all the same.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No new protections.</strong> The record shows no bold moves from local leaders. No press releases. No votes for safer crossings. No push for lower speed limits or more cameras. The silence is heavy. The danger is not.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany gave it to them. But here, the limit stands. The city can build more protected crossings. But here, the curb stays high, the paint fades, the danger waits.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-hurt-and-kill>The Vehicles That Hurt and Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs killed one and seriously injured another. Sedans left four pedestrians hurt, one with lasting wounds. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes did not kill here. But the street is still a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Every injury is a warning. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits, more cameras, safer crossings.</strong> Do not wait for another child’s blood on the street. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
