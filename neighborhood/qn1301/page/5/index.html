One serious injury. Eighty-five hurt in the last year.</strong> These are not numbers. They are people from Glen Oaks-Floral Park-New Hyde Park. A 67-year-old man struck and killed by an SUV on 73rd Avenue. A child, age one, left with head injuries. A five-year-old girl, blood on her face, not far from home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash data does not blink</a>.</p><p><strong>In the past twelve months, 153 crashes.</strong> No one walks away unchanged. The old, the young, the in-between. The street does not care. The SUV does not yield. The sedan does not slow. The body breaks all the same.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No new protections.</strong> The record shows no bold moves from local leaders. No press releases. No votes for safer crossings. No push for lower speed limits or more cameras. The silence is heavy. The danger is not.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany gave it to them. But here, the limit stands. The city can build more protected crossings. But here, the curb stays high, the paint fades, the danger waits.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-hurt-and-kill>The Vehicles That Hurt and Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs killed one and seriously injured another. Sedans left four pedestrians hurt, one with lasting wounds. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes did not kill here. But the street is still a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Every injury is a warning. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Adams argued, “MTA is a statewide obligation. We’re doing our share.” State lawmakers, including Assembly Member Ed Braunstein and State Senator Liz Krueger, countered that the city should help. Hochul’s budget would shift more costs—like Access-A-Ride and student Metrocards—to the city. Progressive lawmakers suggested taxing the wealthy and freezing fares. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins warned, “To increase fares would be detrimental.” The debate continues as the legislature drafts its own budget. No direct safety analysis was provided, but funding gaps threaten transit service, putting vulnerable riders at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cameras now run all day, every day. Seven members opposed. Supporters cited lives lost when cameras slept. Opponents called it a tax. The vote followed a deadly year. Danger stalks city streets, especially near schools.</p><p class=mb3>On May 26, 2022, the New York City Council voted 43-7 to approve Albany’s extension and expansion of the city’s speed camera program. The measure, handled by the Transportation Committee, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7. The matter summary: 'The City Council approved Albany's extension and expansion of New York's speed camera program, allowing cameras to operate 24/7, but not before several council members voiced opposition.' Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers urged action, saying, 'We must use all the tools at our disposal.' Council Members Joan Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and David Carr opposed, calling cameras a financial burden. Eric Dinowitz defended the program: 'If you don't want a speeding ticket, don't speed.' The vote came after a year of high road deaths, with special risk near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
