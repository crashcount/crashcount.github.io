Heavy vehicles do outsized harm here: trucks and buses are tied to pedestrian deaths and serious injuries, while cars and SUVs rack up the numbers (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>vehicle rollup and pedestrian causes</a>).</p><p>Peak danger comes in the late day and night.

Council weighs bills to license e-bikes, raise pay, and study conditions. DOT opposes registration. Advocates warn of criminalization. City Hall silent. Streets stay dangerous for those on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>On February 27, 2025, the City Council considered three bills: Intro 606 (register and license all e-bikes), Intro 1133 (expand minimum wage, study delivery worker conditions), and Intro 1135 (set minimum pay for grocery delivery). Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment. The debate exposes a city divided on how to protect its most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
