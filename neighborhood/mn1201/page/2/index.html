Fourteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, there have been <strong>1,655 crashes</strong>. The dead do not speak. The wounded limp, or do not walk at all.</p><p>A 76-year-old man was killed crossing Broadway. The car kept going straight. The man did not. No policy brought him back (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A cyclist, 73, died on Saint Nicholas Avenue.

Neither did he (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>Most of the pain falls on the young and working-age.</strong> In the last year, 239 people were hurt.

Who Bears the Cost?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> They killed. They broke bodies. Trucks and motorcycles followed. Bikes, too, left scars, but the numbers are small.

But the dead cannot answer.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—and What They Haven’t</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps. <strong>Senator Robert Jackson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a></strong> and to require speed limiters for repeat speeders. <strong>Assembly Member Al Taylor <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored the speed limiter bill</a></strong>. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>The city touts a drop in deaths. <strong>&ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo;</strong> said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said</a>). But the bodies still fall. The pain is not gone. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong> The city moves slow. The cars move fast. Only you can force the change.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2025, Streetsblog NYC reported on the NYC DOT microhub delivery pilot. The program, launched in April, aimed to shift parcel transfers from trucks to cargo bikes at three Upper West Side sites. The matter summary states: 'Microhub parking zones reserved for e-commerce firms to offload parcels from trucks to cargo bikes and hand-carts routinely go unused.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez backed the plan, but only Amazon and Net-Zero Logistics used their hubs. UPS trucks kept blocking streets. DOT threatens to revoke unused permits. The safety impact is negative: unused microhubs mean trucks still crowd curbs, missing a chance to protect pedestrians and cyclists from large vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
