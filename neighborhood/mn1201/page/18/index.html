Thirteen seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, Washington Heights (South) has seen 1,581 crashes. <strong>817 people injured.</strong> The bodies pile up. The pain does not fade. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The dead are not just numbers. Two men, 35 and 73, lost on the street. A 76-year-old pedestrian struck at Broadway and West 161st. A cyclist, 73, killed on Saint Nicholas Avenue. A crash on the Henry Hudson Parkway left two men dead, one with crush injuries, another with a broken body. The living carry scars. A cyclist, 57, left bleeding after a collision with a taxi at Fort Washington Avenue. A motorcyclist, 33, torn open on Saint Nicholas. The list goes on.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are the main weapons. Trucks, taxis, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll, but the bulk comes from cars. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot or bike.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They tout new speed limits and cameras. But in Washington Heights (South), the carnage continues. <strong>No local leader has stood up with urgency.</strong> No bold plan. No public reckoning. The silence is loud. The blood is real.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. The council, the mayor, the DOT—they can act. They can lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. But they move slow. The dead do not wait.</p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the power they have. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people on foot and bike. Do not let another family mourn in silence. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'No loss of life on our streets is acceptable.' The DOT has already added curb extensions and new crosswalks.

Council member Erik Bottcher called for similar changes on 10th and 11th Avenues. Local advocate Christine Berthet called the new space 'just like having air to breathe.' The redesign removed a car lane in a neighborhood where most households lack cars. Still, the use of paint over concrete means drivers, including NYPD, sometimes park illegally on pedestrian space.

Two male passengers, ages 22 and 29, in the sedan were injured with fractures and dislocations to their shoulders. Both were conscious and not ejected from the vehicle. The report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The SUV sustained damage to its left front bumper, and the sedan was damaged on its right front bumper.

Critics say low fees fuel car ownership, crowding out transit, bikes, and green space. Experts warn it’s a subsidy for drivers, not a fix for congestion or emissions.</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2023, a Senate proposal surfaced to create a Residential Parking Permit system in New York City. The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
