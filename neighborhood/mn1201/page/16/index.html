The bicyclist was not wearing any safety equipment, but this was not listed as a contributing factor. The truck driver held a valid New York license, while the bicyclist was unlicensed.

Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.

Victims’ families demand action. Cameras cut crashes. But the most dangerous drivers remain loose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2024, the Department of Transportation released a report urging passage of a bill to expand New York City’s red-light camera program. The bill, supported by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and sponsored by State Senator Andrew Goundardes, would boost camera coverage from 150 to 1,325 intersections—about 10% of the city’s 13,700 signals. The report states: “Expanding the number of intersections with red light cameras... could substantially enhance the deterrent effect of the program and return New York City to the consistently downward trend of red light-running behavior we had seen prior to the pandemic.” Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz also supports expansion, calling for cameras at every intersection. The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains. Relatives of crash victims joined the call, demanding the city confront driver negligence and protect the community.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gustavo Ajche of Los Deliveristas Unidos said, 'We're deeply disappointed to see local and state leaders introduce legislation that would put the burden of penalty on delivery workers rather than trying to regulate the app companies.'

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2024, ten New York City community boards endorsed a citywide ban on parking at intersections—a practice called daylighting. The boards urge the city to stop exempting itself from state law requiring no parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. The resolution follows fatal crashes involving children at poorly visible corners. The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data. DOT pledges to daylight 1,000 intersections yearly, but no full safety analysis exists.

The bus lane will now run 24/7, not just during rush hours. DOT will widen the bike lane from six to up to ten feet in places. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the project will 'make commutes faster' and 'better protect the increasing number of cyclists,' putting 'people first on Manhattan’s avenues.'

The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives.

Her family car racked up 25 tickets in 16 months—20 for speeding near schools. Critics call her actions hypocritical. Advocates say public trust and lives are at stake.</p><p class=mb3>On February 17, 2024, Councilwoman Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), chair of the City Council’s Transportation Committee, came under fire after media reports revealed her family car received 25 traffic tickets in 16 months, including 20 for speeding near schools. The controversy centers on officials’ personal compliance with traffic laws while publicly supporting measures like speed cameras and congestion pricing. Brooks-Powers, who has promoted speed cameras and legislation to reward reporting hit-and-run drivers, claims her husband was responsible for the violations and that she has not used the car in over a year. Councilman Robert Holden called her a 'hypocrite,' while safe streets advocate Adam White stressed, 'Public officials and their families need to abide by speed cameras and red lights... people’s lives are at risk.' The incident highlights the gap between public safety advocacy and personal conduct, raising questions about accountability and public trust.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
