Fourteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, there have been <strong>1,655 crashes</strong>. The dead do not speak. The wounded limp, or do not walk at all.</p><p>A 76-year-old man was killed crossing Broadway. The car kept going straight. The man did not. No policy brought him back (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A cyclist, 73, died on Saint Nicholas Avenue.

Neither did he (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>Most of the pain falls on the young and working-age.</strong> In the last year, 239 people were hurt.

Who Bears the Cost?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> They killed. They broke bodies. Trucks and motorcycles followed. Bikes, too, left scars, but the numbers are small. The city blames speed. The city blames distraction. The city blames the dead for crossing wrong. But the dead cannot answer.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—and What They Haven’t</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps. <strong>Senator Robert Jackson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a></strong> and to require speed limiters for repeat speeders. <strong>Assembly Member Al Taylor <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored the speed limiter bill</a></strong>. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>The city touts a drop in deaths. <strong>&ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,&rdquo;</strong> said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said</a>). But the bodies still fall. The pain is not gone. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong> The city moves slow. The cars move fast. Only you can force the change.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The announcement followed a year with 187 deaths and over 37,000 injuries by September 30. Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez called for a shift away from car dominance, pushing for a safer, more inclusive city. Despite progress, the toll on vulnerable road users remains high.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez supported the delay to align with a $7.25-million federal RAISE grant. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno said the funding will help 'prioritize active transportation projects that will reconnect historically disenfranchised communities.'

He passed too close, failed to yield, and faced no charges. The city lacks a three-foot passing law. A 2019 bill to fix this died in committee. Cyclists remain exposed. Justice denied.</p><p class=mb3>In 2019, then-Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez introduced a bill requiring drivers to keep a minimum three-foot distance when overtaking cyclists. The bill, supported by NYPD and DOT, never reached a vote before Rodriguez’s term ended and has not been reassigned. The bill summary states it 'would require drivers of motor vehicles to maintain a minimum distance of three feet when overtaking a bicycle.' Rodriguez sponsored the bill. Legal experts Daniel Flanzig and Steve Vaccaro criticized the lack of enforcement and the absence of a defined safe passing law, noting that most of the country already has such protections. Flanzig called the law essential to prevent tragedies like the death of Kala Santiago, who was killed by a truck driver on Parkside Avenue. Without this law, cyclists remain at risk, and drivers rarely face consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Joseph, in a joint statement with Transportation Alternatives, said, "The tragic death of yet another cyclist in our city, this time in my own neighborhood, shows how far we need to come to address traffic violence." Joseph called for urgent action to make streets safer. Parkside Avenue, not a designated truck route, has seen 161 injuries in five years, including 28 cyclists and 25 pedestrians. Advocates, including Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives, demanded the city fast-track protected bike lanes, warning, "Lives are on the line." The city has completed eight miles of protected lanes this year, with a goal of 20 by January.

Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress. Road deaths remain high, and the city lags on legal mandates for bus and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter aims to 'reduce congestion and emissions, improve safety and increase visibility,' especially in overburdened neighborhoods like Red Hook and Sunset Park. Avilés, the lead sponsor, calls for systematic changes: 'We really need to look systematically at more improved routes to ensure people are safe.' The bills would require the Department of Transportation to daylight intersections and the Department of Environmental Protection to install air monitors on heavy-use roads. Councilwoman Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsors a related bill for public truck-route data.

One in five top jobs sit empty. Projects stall. Safety work slows. Leadership wobbles. Staff burn out. Promises break. Streets stay dangerous. The city’s most vulnerable pay the price. The lights stay on, but hope flickers.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published September 22, 2022, exposes a staffing crisis inside the New York City Department of Transportation. Nearly 20% of top agency positions are vacant. The article, titled 'Just Keeping the Lights On,' details how these gaps cripple street safety and improvement projects. Key leadership roles—chief of staff, general counsel, communications director—remain unfilled. Employees blame city hiring policies, pandemic resignations, and weak leadership from Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. One former staffer says, 'We couldn't produce anything new. We were just keeping the lights on.' Another warns, 'The agency's ability to respond to severe injuries and fatalities is also limited and slow.' Political interference and lack of expertise at the top deepen the crisis. The result: fewer bus lanes, stalled bike infrastructure, and a city where vulnerable road users face mounting danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They want a two-way bike lane, wider walkways, better lights, and cameras. The bridge is old, narrow, and dark. Crossing is risky. They demand action to protect people.</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2022, Council Member Althea Stevens joined Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson, and Council Member Carmen de la Rosa in a joint letter to the Department of Transportation. The letter calls for urgent upgrades to the 133-year-old Washington Bridge. The officials demand a two-way protected bike lane, wider pedestrian paths, improved lighting, and safety cameras. The letter states: 'The city has done a terrific job of making wise investments in improving mobility on both sides of the Harlem River, but left the bridge with just two very narrow, poorly lit lanes for foot and bike traffic.' Stevens and her colleagues stress that the bridge is unsafe for people on foot and bike. They urge DOT to act, citing the need to reduce traffic deaths and make the bridge safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
