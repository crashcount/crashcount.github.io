Introduced February 28, 2024, by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, the bill would 'prohibit the issuance of multiple bus lane violation tickets for the same infraction within a one hour period.' Narcisse sponsored the measure. The bill aims to stop drivers from getting stacked tickets for a single bus lane offense. There is no evidence this move will help or harm pedestrians, cyclists, or passengers. The danger on streets remains. Enforcement gets softer. Vulnerable road users see no relief.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by Council Members Tiffany Caban and Shahana Hanif, aims to 'greenlight pedestrians to freely cross streets outside the crosswalk or without obeying traffic signals.' The bill responds to claims of biased enforcement against Black and Latino New Yorkers. Council Majority Leader Joseph Borelli and Councilwoman Joann Ariola oppose the bill, warning it could endanger pedestrians. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or received a hearing. The NYPD and Mayor's office are reviewing the legislation. The debate highlights the tension between enforcement fairness and the ongoing risk to vulnerable road users.
