The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>A minivan veered off Brookville Boulevard and struck a tree. Four seniors inside. One woman in her seventies did not make it out alive.

The rest were passengers, their lives ended by a van that left the road.</p><p>The injuries pile up. <strong>285 people hurt in the last year.</strong> Most were in cars, but some were walking.

They talk about speed cameras and lower limits. But in Rosedale, the carnage continues. <strong>No local leader has stood on Brookville Boulevard and promised change.</strong> No new law has slowed the cars or protected the old and the young. The silence is as loud as the sirens.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This does not have to go on.</strong> Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that put people before cars.

Most died on streets without protection. The mayor broke his promise on bike lanes. Projects stalled. Advocates blame City Hall. Council urged to pass Intro 417. The city touts progress. Riders keep dying.</p><p class=mb3>A new report from Transportation Alternatives, published October 17, 2023, slams Mayor Adams for failing to meet the City Council-mandated NYC Streets Plan. The report states, 'Traffic crashes in New York City killed more cyclists through the first nine months of 2023 than all but one other year on record.' Adams promised 75 miles of new protected bike lanes each year but delivered just 26.3 miles in 2022, missing the 30-mile benchmark and falling far short of the 50-mile requirement for 2023. Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, accused Adams of putting 'politics over people' and called on Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and colleagues to pass Intro 417, which would eliminate a three-month delay in bike lane construction. DOT spokesman Chris Browne defended the administration, citing nearly 100 street projects. But the report is clear: delays and broken promises leave cyclists exposed and dying.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, which launched in the Bronx in 2021, logged nearly 3 million trips with zero fatalities and few serious injuries in its first year. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Shared e-scooter service can play an important role in providing sustainable options to connect eastern Queens commuters to transit hubs, commercial corridors, and other neighborhood destinations." Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards both voiced support, highlighting the program's focus on underserved communities and environmental benefits. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged the city to pair the expansion with protected infrastructure, warning that safe streets must come with new mobility. The DOT will continue outreach ahead of the launch, expected in the second half of 2024.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers (District 31) criticized the Department of Transportation’s oversight during a council hearing on bike infrastructure. The matter, described as 'Cycling safety advocacy and protest; criticism of mayoral transportation policy; city council oversight of bike infrastructure implementation,' centers on a record 26 cyclist deaths so far in 2023—the highest since Vision Zero began. Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called DOT’s lack of progress tracking on the Streets Plan 'unacceptable.' The city has built only 13.5 of the required 50 miles of protected bike lanes this year. Advocates accuse Mayor Adams of abandoning cyclists and failing to meet legal safety obligations. Protesters rode from Union Square to City Hall, demanding action as the death toll climbs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Officials dodged questions. Council grilled DOT. Advocates tracked the shortfall. Political meddling blocks safer streets. Vulnerable New Yorkers wait. Progress stalls. Danger stays.</p><p class=mb3>On September 13, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on the Department of Transportation’s progress toward mandated bus and bike lane construction. The hearing, led by Transportation Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for answers. The law requires 150 miles of protected bus lanes and 250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026. In 2022, the city built only 4.4 miles of bus lanes and 26.3 miles of bike lanes, far short of the legal benchmarks. Councilmember Lincoln Restler criticized political interference, saying, 'We're at a point where it's all politics all the time, and we're failing to execute.' Advocacy groups confirmed the city lags behind. The administration’s refusal to track or disclose progress leaves vulnerable road users exposed. The city’s failure to act keeps streets dangerous.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users wait as city agencies stall and argue.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2023, the City Council Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, held an oversight hearing on the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) compliance with the Streets Master Plan under Local Law 195. Brooks-Powers demanded specifics: 'DOT has struggled to meet its legal mandate. In 2021, DOT installed just 4.4 miles of bus lane—well below 20-mile requirement.' DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton and Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, refused to provide current figures, promising data next year. Brooks-Powers called this 'unacceptable.' She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency. Staffing shortages and council opposition to projects were cited as obstacles. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The data, compiled by Transportation Alternatives, showed his Brooklyn district suffered the most traffic injuries citywide in the first half of 2023: 36 pedestrians, 24 cyclists, and 41 motorists. The matter summary reads, 'New York City is on pace for one of the deadliest years for bike riders in recent history, but it doesn't have to be this way.' Restler called on the Adams administration to 'prioritize and expedite proven solutions that will save lives, especially the swift implementation of a truly protected network of bike lanes.' The statement underscores the urgent need for systemic change as vulnerable road users bear the brunt of failed policy and dangerous streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted the proposal's promise: 'both new train service and park land.' State Sen. James Sanders led the call, declaring, 'Yes, we want a park and yes we want a light rail. We can have both.' Mike Scala, another advocate, stressed public support for a combined approach. The QueensLink faces competition from the QueensWay, a park-only plan with $35 million in city funding. The MTA has not committed, citing high costs and ongoing needs assessment. No formal council bill or committee action is recorded yet.
