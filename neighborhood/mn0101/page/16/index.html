A child, 11, struck by a moped on Maiden Lane. A 67-year-old man, head bloodied, hit by a sedan at West and Liberty. Cyclists thrown from bikes on Broadway and Fulton. The city keeps moving. The pain stays put.</p><p>Last week, a city worker fixing a street sign at Broadway and Cedar was slashed by a man on an e-bike after a near miss. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>“abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving”</a>. The worker was treated and released. The rider fled. The street was washed clean, but the wound remains.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-harm>The Machines That Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main threat.</strong> In the past three years, they caused 88 pedestrian injuries—two of them serious. Trucks and buses hurt 13 more. Bikes and mopeds, 14. The city’s streets are a gauntlet.

The city’s future rides on more than patchwork repairs.</p><p class=mb3>On December 12, 2023, Council Member Gale A. Brewer (District 6) publicly criticized the MTA’s 20-Year Needs Assessment. The critique, titled 'Raising the Regional Bar: Why the MTA 20-Year Needs Assessment Inevitably Falls Flat,' argues the plan 'fails to accomplish its stated mission of bringing the New York region into the 21st century.' Brewer points out the assessment’s focus on maintenance over expansion, noting the lack of major projects and regional integration. She urges the MTA, NJ Transit, Amtrak, and others to cooperate for a seamless, world-class network. Brewer’s stance: the city needs more than cosmetic fixes and must aim for true transit growth. No direct safety impact assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Delivery workers still pay for safety. Sixteen dead, 253 fires this year. City backs the bill. Tech giants resist supplying safe batteries. Workers face high costs. Danger persists on city streets.</p><p class=mb3>On December 11, 2023, a congressional panel advanced the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act, introduced by Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-Bronx). The bill, supported by the city and FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh, requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to create federal safety standards for micromobility batteries. The matter summary states the bill aims to 'protect against the risk of fires.' Torres and advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project pushed for app-based companies to supply certified batteries, but tech giants oppose this. Kavanagh said, 'A strong federal standard for lithium-ion batteries is required to ensure public safety.' Despite new laws, the cost of safe batteries—up to $5,000—still falls on low-paid delivery workers. Sixteen people have died in 253 battery fires this year. The city passed a buyback program for faulty batteries, but it has not started. The burden remains on the most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users wait.</p><p class=mb3>On December 8, 2023, the MTA board approved its congestion pricing plan. The plan, now entering a 60-day public review, sets a $15 daytime toll for drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The matter, titled 'Don’t expect changes to MTA's congestion pricing even after final public review,' underscores the board's resistance to major changes. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'If you change one aspect – the whole thing starts to unravel or fall apart.' Council Member Robert F. Holden was mentioned in the discussion. The board is reconsidering tolls on school buses, but most exemptions are opposed. Lawsuits from New Jersey officials threaten delays.

They demand transit options get a fair shot before bulldozers roll. Critics say the highway will fuel sprawl, worsen air, and ignore climate goals. The Turnpike Authority pushes ahead. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 16, 2023, the Portland City Council unanimously passed a resolution targeting the Gorham Connector highway project. The matter, described as a call to 'stop its work on the highway until rapid transit options have been properly examined,' urges the Maine Turnpike Authority to pause construction. Council members cited climate change and Maine’s emissions goals, demanding transit and land-use reforms come first. The council’s action follows a 2012 study warning that new roads alone won’t fix traffic. Local groups like GrowSmart Maine and businesses such as Smiling Hill Farm oppose the project, fearing it will worsen sprawl and pollution. Despite council opposition and federal funding for transit studies, the Turnpike Authority continues land acquisition and environmental reviews. Vulnerable road users face increased risk if the highway moves forward without transit alternatives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders wait. Promises break. Advocates demand real bus rapid transit: center lanes, fast boarding, tough enforcement. Without action, the city’s buses crawl. Vulnerable riders pay the price in time and danger.</p><p class=mb3>This Streetsblog NYC analysis, published November 13, 2023, examines New York’s failure to deliver true Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). The article, titled 'Want More Rapid Bus Transit? Build Real Bus Rapid Transit,' criticizes Mayor Adams for not following through on campaign pledges to expand bus lanes and implement full BRT. Advocates like Annie Weinstock and JP Patafio argue that dedicated center-running lanes, off-board fare collection, and strict enforcement are needed to speed up buses and protect riders. The piece notes, 'Current bus lanes, like on Utica [Avenue], really it’s almost like a parking lot, because they cover the plates and there’s no enforcement.' The report highlights that without strong leadership and commitment, bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—remain exposed to slow service and street danger. No council bill number or committee is attached; this is a policy analysis and advocacy call to action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The episode detailed how, from Hurricane Katrina to the Lahaina wildfires, seniors bear the brunt of heat, floods, and storms. Host Jeff Wood pressed on the need for policy that protects the vulnerable. The discussion made clear: the system ignores the predictable, mounting toll on older adults.

He told DOT staffers he cares more about community input than hard numbers. His stance leaves city law unmet. Advocates warn: vague promises, little accountability, danger for those outside cars.</p><p class=mb3>On November 1, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams dismissed the city’s legal requirements to build 50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year, as mandated by the Streets Master Plan. In a closed-door meeting with the Department of Transportation, Adams said, "My legacy is not how many bike miles I do. My legacy is not how many bus lanes I do." He signaled a shift from measurable safety benchmarks to a focus on community input, a move DOT staffers called "extremely micromanaged." Adams’s administration has failed to meet even the minimum legal standards for new lanes. A mayoral spokesman claimed the city still delivers "safe, efficient streets," but advocates say Adams’s approach relies on vague metrics and lacks accountability. No council members are directly involved; this is a mayoral policy stance. The result: fewer protected spaces for vulnerable road users, more risk on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The NYPD said a 68-year-old woman 'tripped and fell in front of an SUV driver who then ran right over her, dragging her body across a notoriously treacherous intersection.' The driver, a 72-year-old woman, did not stop until witnesses intervened. Despite the Jeep’s record—two school-zone speeding tickets and a red-light violation since August—police let her go without charges. The NYPD blamed the victim, Aurora Soto, for her own death. Streetsblog reports this is part of a 'long and sordid history of victim-blaming.' The intersection has seen 197 crashes and 49 cyclist and pedestrian injuries since 2019.

No council bill number applies; this is a mayoral policy stance. Adams said, “We have not done a good job of speaking to long-term residents on how they want the shaping of their streets to change.” He announced a new door-to-door engagement strategy on Underhill Avenue, after stalling a bike network project for over a year. Adams’s comments came as he defended delays and rollbacks of approved street safety improvements, citing the need for more community input. Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Juan Restrepo (Transportation Alternatives) condemned the mayor’s approach, warning it gives veto power to small groups and leaves the city “rudderless” on street safety. DOT outreach has dropped to its lowest since Vision Zero began. The city is on pace to miss its bike and bus lane goals for the second year running. Vulnerable road users face continued danger as life-saving projects stall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The curb remains for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On October 11, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams announced a new sanitation rule: buildings with nine or fewer units must use lidded trash bins starting next fall. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) leads the rollout. The plan covers about 41% of city housing. The official summary states, 'New Yorkers living in smaller residential buildings will have to set out their garbage in lidded bins.' DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended sidewalk placement, saying, 'It is standard practice around the world to put wheelie bins out on the sidewalk rather than in the parking lane.' Advocate Christine Berthet countered, 'While the bags will be easy to move between cars, containers will be much harder. And therefore having them in the parking lane would be a major benefit.' The city will retrofit trucks for the new bins. For now, pedestrians must still navigate bins on crowded sidewalks. The curb stays reserved for parked cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, unveiled by DSNY, aims to move trash from sidewalks into closed bins, targeting cleaner streets and less sidewalk clutter. The mayor said, 'Everyday New Yorkers are tired of the rodents, they’re tired of the trash, and this is a small price to pay on ensuring that you can have cleaner streets.' Council member Shaun Abreu, representing West Harlem, voiced strong support, citing visible improvements from the local pilot. The plan requires smaller buildings to use wheeled bins on sidewalks, while larger buildings would get shared curbside containers. The city faces pushback from some residents, but Adams insists street cleanliness is a top concern. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the move could clear sidewalks for pedestrians and reduce hazards from trash piles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal skips real fixes—wider sidewalks, protected lanes, safer work rules.

The bill, discussed in October 2023, has not specified a streamlined process for licensing. The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy.
