But the silence hides pain. Four people suffered serious injuries in 280 crashes in the past twelve months. In total, 110 people were hurt—pedestrians, cyclists, drivers. Some limped away. Some left blood on the crosswalk. The city counts the bodies, but not the cost.</p><p>Children are not spared. An 11-year-old girl was struck by a moped on South Street. She was not in the roadway. She left with severe cuts to her face. The driver was moving too fast. The street was not safe for her. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the crash data.</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. In the last three years, they caused 37 moderate or serious injuries to pedestrians. Buses and trucks added six more. Bikes injured seven. Motorcycles and mopeds, two. The numbers are small, but the wounds are deep. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the full breakdown.</a></p><p>The old and the young are at risk. In the past year, four children under 18 were hurt. Four people over 75 were hurt. No one is immune. The street does not care how old you are.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law allows lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. No new deaths is not the same as safety. Each injury is a warning. Each crash is a failure to protect.</p><p>Local leaders have tools. They can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can redesign streets. They can push Albany to keep speed cameras running. But every delay is another risk. Every day without action is another day someone bleeds on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=act-nowbefore-the-next-siren>Act Now—Before the Next Siren</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, safer streets, and real accountability. The numbers will not stop on their own. Only people can do that. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The pedestrian sustained a contusion and bruise to his shoulder and upper arm but remained conscious. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor to the crash. The bus's point of impact was the left front bumper, and the vehicle sustained no damage. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally. The pedestrian's crossing with the signal was noted but not listed as a contributing factor.
