But the silence hides pain. Four people suffered serious injuries in 280 crashes in the past twelve months. In total, 110 people were hurt—pedestrians, cyclists, drivers. Some limped away. Some left blood on the crosswalk. The city counts the bodies, but not the cost.</p><p>Children are not spared. An 11-year-old girl was struck by a moped on South Street. She was not in the roadway. She left with severe cuts to her face. The driver was moving too fast.

In the last three years, they caused 37 moderate or serious injuries to pedestrians. Buses and trucks added six more. Bikes injured seven. Motorcycles and mopeds, two. The numbers are small, but the wounds are deep. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the full breakdown.</a></p><p>The old and the young are at risk. In the past year, four children under 18 were hurt. Four people over 75 were hurt. No one is immune. The street does not care how old you are.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law allows lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. No new deaths is not the same as safety. Each injury is a warning. Each crash is a failure to protect.</p><p>Local leaders have tools. They can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can redesign streets. They can push Albany to keep speed cameras running. But every delay is another risk. Every day without action is another day someone bleeds on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=act-nowbefore-the-next-siren>Act Now—Before the Next Siren</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The driver of the rear sedan and the front passenger in that vehicle were both injured, suffering neck and back injuries respectively. Both occupants were wearing lap belts and experienced shock and complaints of pain or nausea. The driver was licensed in New York and was also injured.

They seek to stop city agencies from issuing parking permits to private vehicles unless the car belongs to an elected official.
