But the silence hides pain. Four people suffered serious injuries in 280 crashes in the past twelve months. In total, 110 people were hurt—pedestrians, cyclists, drivers. Some limped away. Some left blood on the crosswalk. The city counts the bodies, but not the cost.</p><p>Children are not spared. An 11-year-old girl was struck by a moped on South Street. She was not in the roadway. She left with severe cuts to her face. The driver was moving too fast. The street was not safe for her. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the crash data.</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. In the last three years, they caused 37 moderate or serious injuries to pedestrians. Buses and trucks added six more. Bikes injured seven. Motorcycles and mopeds, two. The numbers are small, but the wounds are deep. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the full breakdown.</a></p><p>The old and the young are at risk. In the past year, four children under 18 were hurt. Four people over 75 were hurt. No one is immune. The street does not care how old you are.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law allows lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. No new deaths is not the same as safety. Each injury is a warning. Each crash is a failure to protect.</p><p>Local leaders have tools. They can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can redesign streets. They can push Albany to keep speed cameras running. But every delay is another risk. Every day without action is another day someone bleeds on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=act-nowbefore-the-next-siren>Act Now—Before the Next Siren</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, safer streets, and real accountability. The numbers will not stop on their own. Only people can do that. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The program, starting fall 2023 in West Harlem, covers up to 10 residential blocks and 14 public schools. The DSNY report, with McKinsey input, finds containerization viable for most neighborhoods. The matter aims to 'remove garbage bags from sidewalks' and address public health. Council member Shaun Abreu supports the initiative, calling current practices 'backwards' and endorsing large-scale containerization. Advocates like CHEKPEDS founder Christine Berthet support repurposing parking for trash containers, citing sidewalk access. The city will double trash collection in the pilot area, with $5.7 million allocated. The plan faces challenges in dense areas, but signals a shift toward safer, cleaner streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

MTA board member Andrew Albert pushed for more dedicated lanes, while CEO Janno Lieber urged Mayor Adams to meet legal bus lane minimums. The MTA aims to expand cameras to 1,000 buses, covering 80 percent of lanes. The city DOT has fallen behind on required bus lane mileage. Delivery firms like Amazon and UPS are frequent offenders.

Former council member Erica Gilmore and America Walks president Mike McGinn voiced strong support. Gilmore said, 'Greater safety, of course, would lead to budget savings over the long run for cities and towns.'

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 29, 2023, Council Member Lincoln Restler and other city officials rallied for Sammy’s Law, a bill allowing New York City to set its own speed limits without state approval. The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a speeding driver in 2013, would let the city lower limits to 20 mph. The matter, described as 'Let New York City lower its own speed limits,' has strong support from the mayor, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, and advocates like Families for Safe Streets. Restler’s action was public advocacy. The Assembly is the final hurdle; the bill is already in the governor’s and Senate’s budgets. Advocates cite a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit change. Families demand action to prevent more deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, led by Clare Miflin of the Center for Zero Waste Design, states: 'The Vanderbilt Avenue open street in Brooklyn could become a blueprint for how the city can finally containerize its trash for collection.' The analysis found that containers could replace sidewalk trash piles, freeing up as much as 25 percent of pedestrian space. The Department of Transportation is redesigning the road, adding curb extensions and loading zones, while the Department of Sanitation considers new collection methods. The plan calls for curbside bins, reducing sidewalk obstacles for pedestrians and shifting space away from cars and trash. No council member sponsored this report, but city agencies and experts are involved. The report argues for urgent action to reclaim public space from garbage and vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates warn it steals curb space from bike lanes and plazas. Billions go to cars, not transit or safe walking. The plan leaves vulnerable road users in the dust.</p><p class=mb3>On March 24, 2023, the Biden administration announced a federal initiative to build a vast network of electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs, aiming for 500,000 plugs and offering a $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit. The policy, described as a 'multi-billion dollar network of electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs,' claims to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030. Transportation advocates Jon Orcutt, Chris Rall, and Jaqi Cohen voiced strong opposition, warning that the plan entrenches car dependency and endangers future use of curb space for bike lanes, pedestrian plazas, or outdoor dining. Critics argue the federal grant program ignores transit riders and fails to electrify municipal fleets. As one advocate put it, 'Billions of dollars are essentially being spent to further the public’s dependence on cars with little benefit to those who cannot rely on one.' The initiative, lacking support for transit or active transportation, leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
