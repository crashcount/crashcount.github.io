A child, 11, struck by a moped on Maiden Lane. A 67-year-old man, head bloodied, hit by a sedan at West and Liberty. Cyclists thrown from bikes on Broadway and Fulton. The city keeps moving. The pain stays put.</p><p>Last week, a city worker fixing a street sign at Broadway and Cedar was slashed by a man on an e-bike after a near miss. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>“abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving”</a>. The worker was treated and released. The rider fled. The street was washed clean, but the wound remains.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-harm>The Machines That Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main threat.</strong> In the past three years, they caused 88 pedestrian injuries—two of them serious. Trucks and buses hurt 13 more. Bikes and mopeds, 14. The city’s streets are a gauntlet. The most vulnerable—children, the old, anyone on foot or bike—pay the price.</p><p>A food cart broke loose from a van on 42nd Street, smashing into a parked car with a woman and child inside. Police found the van packed with propane tanks and fuel. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The city called the response, but the danger was already there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>&ldquo;Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers,&rdquo;</a> the Daily News reported.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> Council Member Marte co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines and protect people on foot. State Senator Kavanagh voted yes to extend school speed zones, a step for child safety. But the city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. The wounds keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action before the next wound opens. The city will not heal itself.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The original lane reduction and protected bike lane plan, previously scrapped, will now move forward for the southern half of the street, between Calyer Street and Meeker Avenue. The matter, described as a return to 'the road diet it had previously finalized and then rejected,' follows months of community outcry and advocacy. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and other local officials celebrated the move, crediting the Make McGuinness Safe coalition for relentless pressure. Restler stated, 'this is a decision that enhances safety in our community, and that's what matters.' The northern half of the boulevard remains unchanged, with two traffic lanes and barrier-protected bike lanes. The city’s action signals a renewed commitment to street safety after repeated delays and political interference.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Irene Kalogrias of Celso de Lemos says, 'Open street days are the busiest days for our store.' Vinni Schroeder of J.Jill urges expansion.

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities.

The plan, described as 'the biggest in the MTA's history,' now awaits review by a panel with appointees from the governor, legislative leaders, and the NYC mayor. Andrea Stewart-Cousins is mentioned in connection with the event. MTA Chair Janno Lieber stressed the plan's aim to 'protect riders from a decline in service due to infrastructure that’s been...neglected or left unfixed.' Governor Kathy Hochul pledged to 'fight to secure as much funding as possible.' The MTA expects $14 billion from the federal government, $8 billion from Albany and the city, and $13 billion from its own debt, leaving a $33 billion gap for the state to fill. The plan’s fate will shape the safety and reliability of transit for millions of New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city aims to connect the Pulaski and Kosciuszko bridges via Borden, Starr, and Review avenues. The project, requested by local civic groups and the community board, follows five deaths—including two cyclists—and over 170 injuries on these roads in five years. Won stated, 'We need to do everything we can to ensure we don’t lose another life to a preventable death.' Thirty-two business owners petitioned DOT to halt the project, citing truck maneuvering dangers. DOT representative Vincent Barone called the route 'a critical gap' in the bike network and promised 'much-needed safety improvements.' The plan will take up to 15 feet from Review Avenue for a two-way bike path and buffer, leaving 22 feet for traffic.

The move slashed $15 billion from transit budgets, threatening repairs and upgrades. Hochul claimed to act for cost-of-living relief, but polling shows her approval at a record low. Republicans seized credit for the pause, while Democrats saw no political gain. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called it sabotage: 'Governor Kathy Hochul took a gamble when she sabotaged our public transit system for political gain and she lost dearly.' The MTA now faces a $33 billion shortfall for its next plan. No new revenue source is in place. The legislature, as Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany notes, already did its job by passing the law. The pause leaves transit riders stranded, while car traffic and systemic danger persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled '‘Doom Loop’ Alert: Transit Systems are Suffering — And Too Many Are Cutting Service,' chronicles how pandemic relief funds are running dry, ridership lags, and costs soar. Governor Kathy Hochul killed congestion pricing, stripping the MTA of $1 billion a year. Now, the agency slashes repair programs. Streetsblog quotes transit leaders warning that service cuts mean crowded buses, more cars, and lost productivity. Council members and mayors in cities like Miami and Philadelphia face similar choices. The story makes clear: when transit fails, vulnerable road users—those who walk, bike, or rely on buses—face greater risk. The systemic danger grows as public transportation falters and streets fill with traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report singles out New York: 'where congestion pricing was paused, stands out as the urban core with the biggest increase in both congestion and VMT among the top 25.' Governor Hochul’s decision to halt congestion pricing drew sharp criticism from advocates. Sara Lind, Co-Executive Director of Open Plans, called the move 'disastrous,' warning that abandoning congestion pricing is a 'dereliction of duty' on street safety. The report blames city inaction on bus and bike lanes for worsening gridlock. As driving surges, vulnerable road users face greater risk.

The crash occurred at 9:30 p.m. The report describes, 'A Tesla slammed into a parked taxi. Steel crumpled. The 35-year-old driver was trapped, crushed in the cab.' Emergency responders arrived as the street stood silent, pierced only by sirens and the sound of twisted metal. The taxi driver, a 35-year-old man, suffered crush injuries and was not ejected from the vehicle. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The data shows the taxi was parked and the Tesla was traveling straight ahead before the impact. No driver errors are explicitly named in the report, but the sequence of events centers on the moving vehicle colliding with a stationary one, leaving the vulnerable driver trapped in the aftermath.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The action responds to Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause on congestion pricing, which threatens $2 billion in elevator projects at 23 stations. Organizers cite the MTA’s legal mandate to make 95 percent of the subway accessible by 2055 and warn of a 30 percent cut to ADA spending without congestion pricing funds. Jeff Peters of the Center for Independence of the Disabled NY said, 'Congestion pricing would be used for just this situation.' Danna Dennis of Riders Alliance and Jessica Murray of Elevator Action Group joined calls for action. The protest highlights the direct link between transit funding and safe, accessible passage for all New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city adds more car-free zones for kids. Streets once deadly will now be safer for walking, play, and learning. The move targets neighborhoods hit hardest by crashes.</p><p class=mb3>On August 29, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a record 71 school streets will close to cars this fall. The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 41-year-old male taxi driver was injured, sustaining back injuries and whiplash. The report identifies 'Turning Improperly' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors to the collision. Both vehicles—a 2018 Chevrolet sedan and a 2023 Toyota taxi—were traveling north and making right turns when the crash happened. The taxi's left front bumper and the sedan's right front quarter panel were the points of impact. The taxi driver was licensed and operating the vehicle at the time.

Paint and ticket blitzes failed. Bus speeds barely moved. Riders remain stuck in traffic. Cars clog lanes. Promised fixes scrapped. Advocates demand real action. The city stalls. Riders suffer.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2024, MTA officials sent a scathing letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, criticizing the city’s decision to abandon plans to upgrade Fordham Road’s curbside bus lanes to offset bus lanes. The letter, signed by outgoing NYCT President Richard Davey and interim successor Demetrius Crichlow, called the city’s paint-and-enforcement approach a 'total bust.' The MTA cited new data showing bus speeds increased just 2–4 percent since October 2022—far below the 15 percent target. The matter summary reads: 'The Fordham Road project enjoys widespread support from transit advocacy groups, and Fordham Road bus riders, who have been enduring slow service for decades.' Council involvement is not specified, but the MTA’s letter and Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein both demand stronger measures. The city’s inaction leaves Bronx bus riders stranded in slow traffic, with vulnerable road users paying the price for political compromise.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
