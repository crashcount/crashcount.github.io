But the silence hides pain. Four people suffered serious injuries in 280 crashes in the past twelve months. In total, 110 people were hurt—pedestrians, cyclists, drivers. Some limped away. Some left blood on the crosswalk. The city counts the bodies, but not the cost.</p><p>Children are not spared. An 11-year-old girl was struck by a moped on South Street. She was not in the roadway. She left with severe cuts to her face. The driver was moving too fast. The street was not safe for her. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the crash data.</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. In the last three years, they caused 37 moderate or serious injuries to pedestrians. Buses and trucks added six more. Bikes injured seven. Motorcycles and mopeds, two. The numbers are small, but the wounds are deep. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the full breakdown.</a></p><p>The old and the young are at risk. In the past year, four children under 18 were hurt. Four people over 75 were hurt. No one is immune. The street does not care how old you are.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law allows lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. No new deaths is not the same as safety. Each injury is a warning. Each crash is a failure to protect.</p><p>Local leaders have tools. They can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can redesign streets. They can push Albany to keep speed cameras running. But every delay is another risk. Every day without action is another day someone bleeds on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=act-nowbefore-the-next-siren>Act Now—Before the Next Siren</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, safer streets, and real accountability. The numbers will not stop on their own. Only people can do that. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill is led by Council Member Marjorie Velazquez, though she declined comment as the process continues. The matter, as described by the Regional Plan Association and partners, aims to 'enable merchants or organized groups to tap into the Open Restaurant program and its legal infrastructure, giving new mixed-use space to programs that benefit their communities.' The Alfresco NYC Coalition and advocates like Maulin Mehta support shifting oversight to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a broader, safer approach to curb use. The bill is under active debate, with hearings showing strong support for reclaiming curb space for public benefit, not just cars or restaurants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched. Council Member Erik Bottcher and local activists pushed for the redesign, citing high crash and fatality rates: 173 crashes this year, 40 injuries, and three pedestrian deaths since 2016. Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits.

The story features direct quotes from Arnout and Nicole Zoeller Boelens, who describe the ease and joy of cycling as a family. No council bill, vote, or committee action is involved.

Healthcare costs from vehicle emissions top $21 billion per year in the city. The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.' It argues that walking and biking foster stronger communities and civic engagement, while car traffic breeds isolation and danger.

Disability Rights Advocates attorney Meredith Weaver called the process 'hard-fought,' noting that leaders' inaction led to injuries and isolation.

Cyclists and bus riders get space. Pedestrians breathe easier. Community board backs the plan. Car drivers lose parking. The city moves to fix a deadly gap.</p><p class=mb3>On November 9, 2022, the Department of Transportation proposed repurposing two car lanes on the Washington Bridge for a two-way protected bike lane and a dedicated bus lane. The plan was presented to Manhattan Community Board 12's Traffic and Transportation committee, which gave unanimous advisory support. The DOT aims to install the changes by summer or early fall 2023. The proposal states: 'The city wants to repurpose a pair of car lanes on the Washington Bridge uptown for a two-way bike lane and a bus lane next year, giving a dedicated space to cyclists who are currently forced to share extremely narrow paths with pedestrians.' Lucia Deng, a Transportation Alternatives activist, called the move 'huge,' noting the Bronx and Upper Manhattan have long been neglected. DOT planner Patrick Kennedy said, 'We try to maintain the protected connections as much as possible. They really only work if they’re continuous.' The plan removes 20 parking spaces but connects vital bike and bus routes, giving thousands of non-drivers safer passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, led by University of Washington researchers, argues that 'rolling back the clocks in November may give millions of Americans an extra hour of sleep, but it also costs human and animal lives on U.S. roads that could be saved by making daylight savings time permanent.' The report found that keeping daylight savings time year-round could prevent 33 human deaths and 36,550 deer deaths annually by reducing crashes during dark hours, especially at peak commute times. A 2004 Rutgers study cited in the report found permanent daylight savings time would cut pedestrian deaths by about 13 percent during dusk and dawn. The researchers stress that systemic changes—like mandatory streetlights, traffic-calming infrastructure, and wildlife crossings—are also needed to protect vulnerable road users and wildlife.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The analysis draws a direct line between the rise of SUVs and pickups and the surge in pedestrian deaths. It notes that the largest vehicles are the deadliest, especially for those on foot or bike. The piece argues that taxing these vehicles would not only discourage their use but also shift the burden of their societal costs back onto their owners. The model follows Washington, D.C.'s recent move to scale registration fees by vehicle size and dedicate funds to safety programs.

A driver struck her in a crosswalk. Metal met flesh. Pain followed. The police blamed her. The driver sent a sorry note. She joined the ranks of thousands hurt each year. Streets stay dangerous. Victims carry the weight.</p><p class=mb3>On October 5, 2022, a personal testimony on pedestrian safety and traffic violence was published by Streetsblog NYC. The account details a crash: 'I was hit by a car driver while on my way to a yoga class in my Brooklyn neighborhood.' The driver struck the pedestrian in a crosswalk. Council action is not involved, but the testimony exposes systemic failure. Police blamed the victim: 'The police report blamed the victim: I caused my own pain.' The driver offered an apology, but took no responsibility. The story highlights the normalization of danger for pedestrians and the lack of driver accountability. No safety analyst assessment is available, but the narrative underscores the daily toll of car violence and the routine victim-blaming that follows.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
