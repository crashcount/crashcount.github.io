But the silence hides pain. Four people suffered serious injuries in 280 crashes in the past twelve months. In total, 110 people were hurt—pedestrians, cyclists, drivers. Some limped away. Some left blood on the crosswalk. The city counts the bodies, but not the cost.</p><p>Children are not spared. An 11-year-old girl was struck by a moped on South Street. She was not in the roadway. She left with severe cuts to her face. The driver was moving too fast. The street was not safe for her. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the crash data.</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. In the last three years, they caused 37 moderate or serious injuries to pedestrians. Buses and trucks added six more. Bikes injured seven. Motorcycles and mopeds, two. The numbers are small, but the wounds are deep. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the full breakdown.</a></p><p>The old and the young are at risk. In the past year, four children under 18 were hurt. Four people over 75 were hurt. No one is immune. The street does not care how old you are.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law allows lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. No new deaths is not the same as safety. Each injury is a warning. Each crash is a failure to protect.</p><p>Local leaders have tools. They can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can redesign streets. They can push Albany to keep speed cameras running. But every delay is another risk. Every day without action is another day someone bleeds on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=act-nowbefore-the-next-siren>Act Now—Before the Next Siren</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, safer streets, and real accountability. The numbers will not stop on their own. Only people can do that. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, not yet in committee or assigned a bill number, seeks federal support through the Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods grant. Levine urges Mayor Adams to apply for funding, stating, 'We’re a perfect candidate for Reconnecting Communities.' State Senator Brian Kavanagh voiced support, saying, 'We will work with the borough president.' The proposal would transform the underused highway into a waterfront space for cyclists and pedestrians, echoing successful removals in cities like Seattle and Seoul. The project faces major legal, environmental, and jurisdictional obstacles, as the FDR is state-owned and exempt from congestion pricing. The city previously considered this removal for coastal resiliency, but dropped it from the final plan. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the plan centers vulnerable road users by reclaiming space from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency.

The official summary claims 'new improvements' and uses language of equity and sustainability. Advocates like Janet Gallant and Ben Crowther call it 'greenwashing' and a 'marketing ploy.' Brian O’Malley points to the climate crisis. Lawsuits challenge the plan, which critics say will worsen health and climate impacts, especially for Black and brown communities.

The article, reviewed by Streetsblog NYC, highlights systemic failures: unsafe streets, lack of charging infrastructure, and tech companies shifting risk onto underpaid delivery workers. Council Member Alexa Aviles urges rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and blames corporate greed. State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle. The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.' Advocacy groups reject punitive crackdowns on workers, pushing instead for expanded bike lanes and public infrastructure. The piece concludes that only a multi-pronged, structural approach—never just enforcement—will protect vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Beyond KSI: How DOT Can Identify Unsafe Streets Before Tragedy Strikes,' exposes how KSI misses hidden dangers and fails to prevent future deaths. No council bill number is attached; this is a public call to action, not legislation. The critique highlights that, despite 37 road deaths on the Upper West Side in ten years, DOT’s 2023 plan ignored these corridors. The author mapped safety features and hazards, proposing a new, proactive metric based on accessibility, comfort, and livability. The piece urges DOT to shift from counting casualties to preventing them, stating, 'we need a different metric to fix the underlying problem of safety on city streets—one that is community-centered and doesn’t reduce our assessment of a certain street’s needs to grim numbers.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident marks the 21st cyclist death this year, the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. The matter highlights that only 1.64% of district streets have protected bike lanes, far below the city average. Jada Yeboah, Bronx/Uptown Organizer for Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city's failure: "Inaction is killing New Yorkers of color." She demanded Mayor Adams meet legal requirements for protected bike lanes, noting only five miles have been built in the Bronx out of 50 required citywide this year. The Bronx ranks third in traffic fatalities, eighth in injuries among 51 districts. The city's inaction leaves cyclists exposed.

The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options.
