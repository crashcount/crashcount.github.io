A child, 11, struck by a moped on Maiden Lane. A 67-year-old man, head bloodied, hit by a sedan at West and Liberty. Cyclists thrown from bikes on Broadway and Fulton. The city keeps moving. The pain stays put.</p><p>Last week, a city worker fixing a street sign at Broadway and Cedar was slashed by a man on an e-bike after a near miss. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>“abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving”</a>. The worker was treated and released. The rider fled. The street was washed clean, but the wound remains.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-harm>The Machines That Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main threat.</strong> In the past three years, they caused 88 pedestrian injuries—two of them serious. Trucks and buses hurt 13 more. Bikes and mopeds, 14. The city’s streets are a gauntlet. The most vulnerable—children, the old, anyone on foot or bike—pay the price.</p><p>A food cart broke loose from a van on 42nd Street, smashing into a parked car with a woman and child inside. Police found the van packed with propane tanks and fuel. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The city called the response, but the danger was already there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>&ldquo;Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers,&rdquo;</a> the Daily News reported.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> Council Member Marte co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines and protect people on foot. State Senator Kavanagh voted yes to extend school speed zones, a step for child safety. But the city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. The wounds keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action before the next wound opens. The city will not heal itself.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries. The senators warned that inaction could lead to blanket bans, hitting delivery workers hardest. The city’s plan for safe charging hubs faces local opposition.

The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2023, a closed-door City Hall meeting gathered Brooklyn political figures to debate the future of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The event, organized by Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi, focused on whether to reduce the BQE from three lanes to two. Former Brooklyn Democratic Party Chair Frank Seddio opposed the lane reduction, urging allies to resist the change. The meeting excluded some officials who support shrinking the highway, such as Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, who cite environmental and community health concerns. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the city for favoring a three-lane solution and sidelining affected communities. City Hall denied taking a side, stating, 'the decision would be based on a DOT traffic study.' No formal council bill or vote was recorded, and no safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Governor Hochul’s 2023 state budget proposal, analyzed March 3, 2023, keeps New York State’s long-running refusal to match MTA funding under law 18-b. The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt. The budget leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as transit stagnates and car dominance persists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Eyes on the Street: The First (And Only?) Snow Report of the Year,' details how sidewalk snow clearance, left to property owners, forced bus riders into slush. Painted bike lanes became useless as drivers shoveled snow into them and plows avoided parked cars. The Department of Sanitation’s new narrow snowplows cleared some routes well, but the Parks Department left cycling paths impassable, showing 'no interest...to encourage cycling.' Only the Brooklyn Bridge bike path stood out, freshly swept and safe. No council bill or vote is attached, but the report exposes how city agencies’ uneven snow removal endangers pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to curb driver recklessness in work zones, where danger is high and impact is deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets remain deadly. Accountability is missing.</p><p class=mb3>A pending City Council bill would require daylighting—removing parking near corners—at 100 intersections per year. The Department of Transportation opposes the bill. The issue gained urgency after three pedestrians, including 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun, died in separate crashes over the weekend of February 19, 2023. One victim was killed at an intersection where parked cars blocked visibility and the ADA ramp. Another, Zabina Gafoor, was struck by an NYPD vehicle responding to an emergency. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city’s failure to implement proven safety measures, saying, 'Our city’s children deserve to grow up without the threat of traffic violence.' The bill remains pending. Critics say the city’s refusal to daylight intersections and hold drivers accountable continues to put lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Double parking, fumes, and chaos follow. The piece calls for a same-day delivery tax.

The article highlights the unchecked rise of ultra-fast shipping, noting, 'the fallout looks like a veritable armada of delivery trucks triple-parking in your neighborhoods.' The author supports regulation of rapid delivery, investment in transit, and use of micro-mobility for last-mile trips. Council bill number and committee details are not applicable, as this is not a legislative action but a policy proposal. The piece argues that a delivery tax would push consumers toward sustainable choices and fund shared infrastructure, especially transit. It stresses that unchecked delivery harms vulnerable communities with pollution and congestion, and urges cities to prioritize curb management, electric trucks, and e-cargo bikes to protect public space and safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report covers July through October 2022 and cites 'fewer contractors available, shortages in installation materials, and general political opposition' as reasons for a 42% drop in bike lane miles and a 47% drop in bus lane miles compared to the previous year. Streetsblog’s coverage, criticized by City Hall and DOT, revealed that vacancies and political interference—especially from Council Members Bob Holden and Oswald Feliz—stalled projects like the Citi Bike expansion in Queens and the Fordham Road bus lane in the Bronx. DOT completed only 67% of its bus lane mandate and fell 17% short on bike lanes. The city’s own numbers now confirm what advocates warned: delays and obstruction put vulnerable road users in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing exposed failures: missed targets for protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safety investments. Council members called for real infrastructure, not just enforcement. Advocates demanded accountability and action for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><p class=mb3>On January 27, 2023, the City Council’s Transportation Committee held an oversight hearing on street safety and Vision Zero implementation. The hearing, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, questioned whether Mayor Adams is honoring his pledge to end road violence. The matter focused on the administration’s failure to meet Council-mandated benchmarks in the NYC Streets Plan, especially protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers stated, 'No New Yorker should have to fear for their life while crossing or using our streets.' She stressed that enforcement alone is not enough, demanding equitable infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods. Advocacy leaders like Elizabeth Adams and Sara Lind echoed the call for physical changes and accountability. The hearing marked a rare moment of scrutiny, with advocates welcoming the Council’s push for real safety measures for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Still, these women serve the city with grit and pride.</p><p class=mb3>This testimony, published January 26, 2023, documents the daily reality for women transit operators. The article, titled "What It’s Like to Be a Woman Transit Operator," highlights first-person accounts from women in New York and other cities. They describe being underrepresented, facing unwanted advances, and earning less than male colleagues. One operator, Tonya Abernathy, says, 'As a female it’s harder, because some passengers treat you differently because you’re a woman.' Thejoal Hope adds, 'You get a lot of disrespect, and you got to learn how to deal with that.' The piece calls for better training, pay equity, and supportive management. No council bill or vote is attached, but the testimony exposes systemic dangers for frontline workers and the urgent need for safer, more inclusive transit workplaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
