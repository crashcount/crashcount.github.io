But the silence hides pain. Four people suffered serious injuries in 280 crashes in the past twelve months. In total, 110 people were hurt—pedestrians, cyclists, drivers. Some limped away. Some left blood on the crosswalk. The city counts the bodies, but not the cost.</p><p>Children are not spared. An 11-year-old girl was struck by a moped on South Street. She was not in the roadway.

The law allows lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. No new deaths is not the same as safety. Each injury is a warning. Each crash is a failure to protect.</p><p>Local leaders have tools. They can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can redesign streets. They can push Albany to keep speed cameras running. But every delay is another risk. Every day without action is another day someone bleeds on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=act-nowbefore-the-next-siren>Act Now—Before the Next Siren</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The bill targets tourist and luxury flights, sparing only essential services. Noise, pollution, and safety risks drive the move. The city’s airspace faces a reckoning.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2022, Council Member Lincoln Restler and colleagues introduced a bill to ban all non-essential helicopter flights from the Wall Street and East 34th Street city-owned helipads. The legislation, discussed in the City Council, exempts NYPD, news, and hospital helicopters. The bill’s matter title: 'Stop the Chop.' Council Members Amanda Farias, Gale Brewer, Shahana Hanif, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Christopher Marte, and Carlina Rivera joined as sponsors. Hanif stated, 'Our airspace is not for sale to the highest bidder and should only be available to essential needs of our city.' The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution. The proposal aims to cut thousands of flights, reduce greenhouse gases, and restore peace to city parks and neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Hearing Day: Could Fees for Outdoor Dining Lead to Proper Pricing of City’s Curbs?', was discussed in committee. Council Member Julie Menin, representing District 5, participated and voiced concerns about noise, garbage, and parking loss. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez explained that fees would depend on location and space size. Advocates like Sara Lind and Marco Conner DiAquoi argued for equity, noting, 'Seventy-five percent of our public curb space is devoted to the movement and storage of vehicles.' The hearing highlighted calls for better public space management and a dedicated oversight office. Community boards remained divided, citing nightlife and local control issues. The debate centered on reclaiming curb space from cars and making the city safer and fairer for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot program, enabled by a state bill signed December 22, aims to fine illegally overweight trucks. The bill was introduced by State lawmakers Brian Kavanagh and Jo Anne Simon. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, pressed for rapid installation, warning, "There are extremely overweight trucks barreling down the triple cantilever every single day that are a hazard to the health and safety of our community." The matter title states: "Tonnage sensors on the BQE will take a year to set up: DOT." The project is complex, requiring city and state DOT coordination and a 90-day grace period once operational. Vulnerable road users remain exposed while the system is delayed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored in the state legislature by Brian Kavanagh and Jo Anne Simon, was signed into law on December 22. The measure, described as a 'critical project' by DOT, aims to catch and fine overweight trucks using new sensors. Restler said, 'There are extremely overweight trucks barreling down the triple cantilever every single day that are a hazard to the health and safety of our community.' DOT claims the system will be operational by year’s end, citing technical complexity. The Brooklyn Heights Association and local officials demand faster action.
