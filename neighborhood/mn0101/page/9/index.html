A child, 11, struck by a moped on Maiden Lane. A 67-year-old man, head bloodied, hit by a sedan at West and Liberty. Cyclists thrown from bikes on Broadway and Fulton. The city keeps moving. The pain stays put.</p><p>Last week, a city worker fixing a street sign at Broadway and Cedar was slashed by a man on an e-bike after a near miss. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>“abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving”</a>. The worker was treated and released. The rider fled. The street was washed clean, but the wound remains.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-harm>The Machines That Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main threat.</strong> In the past three years, they caused 88 pedestrian injuries—two of them serious. Trucks and buses hurt 13 more. Bikes and mopeds, 14. The city’s streets are a gauntlet. The most vulnerable—children, the old, anyone on foot or bike—pay the price.</p><p>A food cart broke loose from a van on 42nd Street, smashing into a parked car with a woman and child inside. Police found the van packed with propane tanks and fuel. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The city called the response, but the danger was already there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>&ldquo;Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers,&rdquo;</a> the Daily News reported.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> Council Member Marte co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines and protect people on foot. State Senator Kavanagh voted yes to extend school speed zones, a step for child safety. But the city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. The wounds keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action before the next wound opens. The city will not heal itself.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Progressive members like Lincoln Restler, Carlina Rivera, Tiffany Cabán, and Shahana Hanif support full removal of parking mandates. But the Council is set to weaken the bill, keeping parking minimums in many areas. This move will slash the number of new housing units and keep dangerous car volumes on city streets.

City officials like Ya-Ting Liu, chief public realm officer, and volunteers such as Alex Morano and Brent Bovenzi, praised the program's impact. Bovenzi noted, 'the program is shrinking because too much of the burden falls upon volunteer labor.'

The move aims to beat a federal block but guts traffic reduction. Streets will see less relief. The plan leaves vulnerable road users exposed. The city trades speed and safety for political timing.</p><p class=mb3>On November 8, 2024, Governor Hochul proposed lowering New York City’s congestion pricing toll from $15 to $9. The plan, a policy proposal to adjust congestion pricing, comes as officials rush to implement it before a new presidential administration can intervene. The original $15 toll, crafted by the Traffic Mobility Review Board and approved by the MTA Board, promised strong traffic reduction and included credits and caps. The $9 version, previously reviewed in environmental assessments, may lack those protections. Economist Charles Komanoff warns, 'You lose other benefits. Most noticeably, you don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes urges swift action, saying, 'The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now.' The lower toll is projected to improve traffic speeds by only 6.4 percent, far less than the 17 percent expected from the original plan. With less traffic reduction, streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation banned enclosed structures, allowing only temporary, open designs. As the city’s Dining Out NYC program shifts to seasonal operation, many owners, like John Kastanis of Casita and Jerry Hsu of Alimama Tea, chose to dismantle their sheds early, citing high fees and storage hurdles.

Instead, it will study tunneling under All Faiths Cemetery. Advocates cheer. The move keeps trains off dangerous roads. The future of the project hangs on funding.</p><p class=mb3>On October 30, 2024, the MTA announced it will abandon the street-running segment of the Interborough Express (IBX) light rail project. The agency now plans to study a tunnel under All Faiths Cemetery at Metropolitan Avenue. MTA President of Construction and Development Jamie Torres-Springer said, "We're looking at a tunnel at Metropolitan Avenue, which will allow us to avoid street running to make the [Interborough Express] faster and more reliable." Transit advocates, including Blair Lorenzo of the Effective Transit Alliance, praised the decision, calling it a win for speed and reliability. The MTA will assess expanding the existing freight tunnel or building a new one. The engineering and environmental review will take about two years. Funding for the IBX remains uncertain, as MTA CEO Janno Lieber warned that expansion projects could be at risk if the 2025-2029 capital plan falls short. The move removes a threat to vulnerable road users by keeping trains off city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Free parking remains king. Promised microhubs for deliveries delayed. Only a sliver of free spaces become paid. Advocates call the effort timid. The city leaves most curb space untouched. Vulnerable users wait.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Transportation’s Smart Curbs pilot, updated October 29, 2024, aims to convert free parking to paid meters and add delivery microhubs on the Upper West Side. The plan, first proposed in June, promised about 200 new metered spots and 27 loading zones, but only 175 free spaces—one-tenth of the area’s 1,700—will be removed. Microhubs, meant to reduce double-parking and delivery chaos, are delayed until next year. DOT spokespersons Vin Barone and Mona Bruno confirmed most changes are just reassignments, not true removals of free parking. Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS called the slow pace disappointing: “We’ve been super eager to see these changes, see what their impact is and start measuring and observing, so it’s a little disappointing.” Parking expert Donald Shoup urged the city to reinvest meter revenue locally, but DOT declined. The pilot leaves most curb space for cars, not people. Vulnerable road users see little relief.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, covered in committee and public statements, is described as 'transformative for so many New Yorkers.' Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who represents the area, had threatened to oppose the IBX if it included street-running. After the MTA’s shift to tunneling, Holden stated, 'Addressing the biggest issue by forgoing light rail on 69th Street is crucial to earning our support.' The plan eliminates a dangerous section where trams would have mixed with cars, reducing exposure for pedestrians and cyclists. The MTA has issued a request for proposals to design the line and guide it through federal review. The $5.5 billion project’s funding remains uncertain, but the tunnel plan removes a major safety concern for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

More debt means higher fares or slashed service. Riders face the threat. Congestion pricing was key. Now, the gap grows. The system’s future hangs on real funding, not empty promises.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2024, State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli released a report warning the MTA against borrowing to fill massive holes in its 2020-2024 and 2025-2029 capital plans. The report, not tied to a council bill but crucial for transit policy, states: 'The MTA can't take on any more debt to fill the hole...without dramatically jacking up fares or cutting service.' DiNapoli’s analysis shows that borrowing $15 billion now, plus $13 billion more for the next plan, would force a 16 percent fare hike by 2037. He notes the MTA’s finances are already strained by weak real estate taxes and slow ridership recovery. DiNapoli opposes fare hikes and service cuts, backing congestion pricing and state support instead. He stresses that without new, reliable revenue, vulnerable riders will pay the price. The warning is clear: more debt means danger for those who depend on transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The toll on life and air remains high.</p><p class=mb3>On October 15, 2024, researchers from Duke, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and the University of Chicago published a working paper through the National Bureau of Economic Research. The report, titled 'The Effects of 'Buy American': Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act,' analyzes the full societal costs of electric vehicles (EVs) versus gasoline vehicles (GVs). The study finds, 'U.S. electric vehicles are only slightly less harmful to the environment and society than conventional gasoline cars.' The analysis aggregates climate damage, crash deaths, and pollution. It reveals that EVs’ heavier weight leads to more fatal crashes, and their battery production is energy-intensive. Charging EVs on carbon-heavy grids causes six times more harmful pollution than gas tailpipes. The authors conclude that, factoring in all harms, EVs are only 10 percent less damaging than GVs. The report urges policymakers to reconsider subsidies and warns that the real-world toll of cars—electric or not—remains immense.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The update, described as 'important steps toward a safer, more people-focused transportation system,' modernizes speed zone setting and allows more crosswalks, green bike lanes, and red transit lanes. But it still falls short. The MUTCD expects pedestrians and cyclists to act 'alertly and attentively,' ignoring human error and the diversity of street users. It keeps high barriers for pedestrian signals and prioritizes car movement over safety. The new section on autonomous vehicles raises concerns about streets being built for machines, not people.
