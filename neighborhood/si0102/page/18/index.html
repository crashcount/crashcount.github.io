Two hundred fifty-eight injured.</strong> That is the price paid on the streets of Tompkinsville-Stapleton-Clifton-Fox Hills since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. In the last year alone, <strong>one person died and seventy-nine were hurt</strong>. Children were not spared—<strong>seventeen under eighteen injured</strong> in twelve months. The old and the young, all at risk.</p><p>A sedan, a bus, an SUV. Metal against flesh. A 69-year-old man killed at Canal and Bay, struck by a bus while crossing at the intersection. A 57-year-old woman, dead behind the wheel on Bay Street. These are not accidents. They are collisions, each one a story cut short.</p><h3 id=the-sound-of-impact>The Sound of Impact</h3><p>On March 15, 2025, a police cruiser slammed into a building at Victory and Montgomery. The officers were answering a gun call. Another car tried a U-turn. The cruiser swerved, lost control, and crashed. Both officers survived. No bystanders were hit. The street was left scarred. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>&ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo;</a> said Abi Aguirre, a witness. The sound of metal and fear lingers.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed, giving the city power to set safer speeds, but the limit is not yet lowered. Cameras work only where they are allowed. The city says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; but the pace is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are not protection.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more redesigns, more urgency. <strong>Every day of delay risks another life.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states, 'sales of gas-guzzling pickups and SUVs are also surging. This other face of the market subverts electric cars’ carbon-cutting progress.' No council bill number or committee is attached, as this is a policy report, not legislation. The analysis highlights that regulatory loopholes and weaker standards for larger vehicles allow automakers to offset EV gains by selling more polluting trucks and SUVs. The author urges tightening greenhouse gas standards, especially for large gasoline-powered vehicles, and closing loopholes that let automakers evade meaningful carbon cuts. The report warns that unless regulators act, excessive emissions from pickups and SUVs will harm the climate and city air for years, stalling the benefits of electric vehicles for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates push for electric buses, cleaner trucks, and strict air monitoring.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, published August 26, 2022, reviews the impact of congestion pricing on air quality, focusing on the Bronx. The report states: 'Air quality and public health in the Bronx will receive a boost from congestion pricing, even under a toll scenario that diverts substantial truck traffic.' The analysis draws from the MTA's environmental assessment, especially Toll Scenario A, which projects less particulate matter (PM2.5) in Bronx air despite increased vehicle miles. The health benefits for Bronx residents match those in Queens, Brooklyn, and Hudson County. Environmental justice and transportation advocates call for rapid electrification of buses and trucks, capping highways, and rigorous air monitoring to prevent new pollution hot spots. The analysis values total health benefits at $20.8 million for 2023. No council members are named in this report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The real fix: fewer, smaller cars on the road.</p><p class=mb3>On August 17, 2022, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) pressed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to address frontover crashes—fatal incidents where large vehicles strike unseen children in front. The senator’s letter called for annual injury and fatality data, improved data collection, and efforts to prevent future deaths. He stated, 'Safety is not—and should never be—a premium feature only available to those who can afford it; it should be the default.' Blumenthal’s push follows a demonstration showing ten children hidden in a single SUV’s blind spot. The bill’s focus is on mandating front cameras, but experts and advocates warn this won’t fix the core problem: cars are too big, too tall, too deadly. As noted, 'The most effective way to reduce tragic frontover deaths is to have fewer cars in American driveways.' Cameras help, but shrinking vehicles and reducing car dependency would save more lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

An opinion from a Transportation Alternatives staffer urged the Council to 'transform impervious driving lanes into green climate solutions.' The piece calls for bioswales and greenspace in place of parking, citing the deadly floods after Hurricane Ida. It highlights that 72 percent of city land is impervious, worsening flash floods. The author presses city leaders, including Mayor Eric Adams, to repurpose street space for climate resilience, referencing the NYC 25x25 challenge. The message is clear: 'Our streets can become the solution to climate change and flooding.'

It allocates $369 billion to decarbonize sectors like power plants and HVAC, aiming for a 40% emissions cut by 2030. The bill continues the $7,500 federal EV tax credit and adds a $4,000 credit for used EVs, but omits dedicated funding for electric transit, freight, or e-bikes. Advocates like Yonah Freemark, David Zipper, and Noa Banayan criticize the focus on large electric SUVs and trucks, calling them dangerous for people outside cars. Zipper says, “We’re actually inducing people to buy heavier, more dangerous electric automobiles.” The bill introduces a $3.4 billion Neighborhood Equity and Access Grant, but skips high-speed rail and transit. Advocates urge more action, warning that the bill leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Crashes mount. Safety claims collapse. Planners and officials keep buying the hype. The toll grows. Vulnerable road users pay the price. It’s time to stop believing and start questioning.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published July 22, 2022, by Kea Wilson in Streetsblog NYC, calls out Elon Musk’s record on transportation technology. The article, titled 'Opinion: Stop Trusting Elon Musk on Tunnels, on Teslas, on Everything,' cites damning crash data and exposes false safety claims around Tesla’s 'Full Self-Driving' feature. At least 273 crashes have been linked to the technology, contradicting Musk’s public statements. The piece urges planners and policymakers to reject Musk’s unproven solutions, including the Boring Company and Hyperloop, and instead focus on reducing vehicle miles traveled. The author warns that uncritical adoption of these technologies endangers vulnerable road users and worsens congestion and pollution. No council bill or vote is involved, but the message is clear: stop trusting tech hype that puts lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
