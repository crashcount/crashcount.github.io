Two hundred fifty-eight injured.</strong> That is the price paid on the streets of Tompkinsville-Stapleton-Clifton-Fox Hills since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. In the last year alone, <strong>one person died and seventy-nine were hurt</strong>. Children were not spared—<strong>seventeen under eighteen injured</strong> in twelve months. The old and the young, all at risk.</p><p>A sedan, a bus, an SUV. Metal against flesh. A 69-year-old man killed at Canal and Bay, struck by a bus while crossing at the intersection. A 57-year-old woman, dead behind the wheel on Bay Street. These are not accidents. They are collisions, each one a story cut short.</p><h3 id=the-sound-of-impact>The Sound of Impact</h3><p>On March 15, 2025, a police cruiser slammed into a building at Victory and Montgomery. The officers were answering a gun call. Another car tried a U-turn. The cruiser swerved, lost control, and crashed. Both officers survived. No bystanders were hit. The street was left scarred. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>&ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo;</a> said Abi Aguirre, a witness. The sound of metal and fear lingers.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed, giving the city power to set safer speeds, but the limit is not yet lowered. Cameras work only where they are allowed. The city says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; but the pace is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are not protection.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more redesigns, more urgency. <strong>Every day of delay risks another life.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers talk, but danger endures.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, published March 28, 2022, reviews the E-BIKE Act and related state bills. The E-BIKE Act, once part of the Build Back Better Act, proposed a federal tax credit for e-bike buyers. Congress reduced the credit from $1,500 to $900 and limited eligibility, stalling progress. The article states, 'By replacing car trips, e-bikes can simultaneously lower emissions, improve street safety, and boost riders' health.' John MacArthur, a transportation program manager, notes that local and state lawmakers now lead with rebates and incentives. Council members and legislators in Vermont, Colorado, California, Washington, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have introduced or supported bills for e-bike rebates. Despite the momentum, no current state proposal pairs incentives with new bike infrastructure. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians and cyclists—remain at risk as car dominance continues and federal action lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'City Covers Up Failure After Cyclist Death, With Hastily Made Repairs After Months of 311 Complaints,' details how residents filed at least eight 311 complaints to the Department of Transportation and 14 to the Department of Environmental Protection since 2019. Both agencies failed to fix the hazard. Only after Wen-Chiang’s death did city workers patch the road, but the repair was rushed and left uneven, creating a new danger. DOT spokesman Vin Barone called it 'a tragedy' and said an investigation is underway. DEP claimed the subsurface infrastructure was sound. No council members are named.

Advocates, including Jaqi Cohen and Kevin Garcia, pressed the new office to prioritize transportation emissions, quoting, 'improving transit options and creating access for environmental justice communities, while also curbing harmful diesel emissions.' Aggarwala voiced support for congestion pricing, pedestrianization, and bus lanes, promising collaboration with the Department of Transportation. Transportation emissions have dropped only 5% since 2007, while car ownership rises.

Cities such as South Bend, Sacramento, Berkeley, Minneapolis, and others lead the charge. State-level changes in Oregon, California, and Connecticut follow. The analysis credits UCLA Professor Donald Shoup’s influence. No council bill number or committee is cited, as this is a legislative trend, not a single bill. The piece notes, 'Minimum parking requirements are on the way out.' These reforms embed parking changes within broader housing and zoning efforts, aiming to cut car dependency and boost affordable housing.

Contributor Charles Komanoff, using his Balanced Transportation Analyzer, finds that an $80 toll would maximize net societal benefit, nearly $10 billion yearly. The article states: 'A $13 or $15 congestion toll might be all the politicians think they can achieve, but such a low fee will fail to maximize the net societal benefit.' Komanoff’s analysis shows the current plan extracts only half the possible benefit while charging less than a fifth of the optimal toll. No council member is named; this is an expert’s call to action. The piece notes that higher tolls could fund subway safety upgrades and faster trains, but the city’s political will remains weak. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as cars dominate.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 75-year-old pedestrian was hit midblock by a driver in a Lincoln Corsair. Gallagher wrote, 'Extremely distressing to see another serious crash injuring a pedestrian on McGuinness. I’m thinking about the victim and continuing to fight for our improvements, which can’t come soon enough.' The street, notorious for speeding and poor crossings, is slated for a $39 million redesign after years of advocacy and deadly crashes. The Make McGuinness Safe Coalition and residents have pushed for a road diet, bike lanes, and traffic calming. The Department of Transportation is gathering public feedback, with construction expected later this year. Gallagher’s stance and the community’s demands highlight the urgent need to protect vulnerable road users on this dangerous stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No one holds Tesla to account.</p><p class=mb3>On January 12, 2022, Streetsblog NYC reported on Tesla’s Full Self Driving (FSD) ‘assertive’ mode. The article, titled “Why Tesla Can Program Its Cars to Break Road Safety Laws,” exposes how Tesla’s October 2021 software update lets drivers select aggressive profiles. In ‘assertive’ mode, Teslas tailgate, perform unsafe passes, and roll through stops—illegal actions in most states. Phil Koopman, an autonomous vehicle expert, said, “Basically, Tesla is programming its cars to break laws.” The report highlights a regulatory gap: U.S. law punishes drivers, not manufacturers. Some states shield automakers, while others seek accountability. NHTSA investigates, but action lags. Tesla faces no immediate recall. The result: automated vehicles threaten pedestrians and cyclists, while lawmakers and regulators look away.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The session, titled 'Building a Better Transit Board,' focused on how agencies address homelessness. Tibbits-Nutt argued, 'as long as we continue to have these discussions in just that safety standpoint... we’re not going to be able to address any of these issues.' Spieler added, 'they have a right to be on the bus as much as anyone else.' Both opposed policing as the main response and urged boards to involve social services. The discussion underscored that transit boards can either foster inclusive safety or reinforce exclusion and danger for vulnerable riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
