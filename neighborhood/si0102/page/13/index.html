Two hundred fifty-eight injured.</strong> That is the price paid on the streets of Tompkinsville-Stapleton-Clifton-Fox Hills since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. In the last year alone, <strong>one person died and seventy-nine were hurt</strong>. Children were not spared—<strong>seventeen under eighteen injured</strong> in twelve months. The old and the young, all at risk.</p><p>A sedan, a bus, an SUV. Metal against flesh. A 69-year-old man killed at Canal and Bay, struck by a bus while crossing at the intersection. A 57-year-old woman, dead behind the wheel on Bay Street. These are not accidents. They are collisions, each one a story cut short.</p><h3 id=the-sound-of-impact>The Sound of Impact</h3><p>On March 15, 2025, a police cruiser slammed into a building at Victory and Montgomery. The officers were answering a gun call. Another car tried a U-turn. The cruiser swerved, lost control, and crashed. Both officers survived. No bystanders were hit. The street was left scarred. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>&ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo;</a> said Abi Aguirre, a witness. The sound of metal and fear lingers.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed, giving the city power to set safer speeds, but the limit is not yet lowered. Cameras work only where they are allowed. The city says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; but the pace is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are not protection.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more redesigns, more urgency. <strong>Every day of delay risks another life.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city had canceled a planned busway after pushback from business owners and Council Member Oswald Feliz, who remains a vocal critic. MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey said, "Our hope is that we DOT stays with us and we're implementing this, hopefully, later this year." MTA CEO Janno Lieber stressed, "We can't deemphasize and under-prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx and also Upper Manhattan who are trying to get east and west across this incredibly busy corridor." DOT spokesperson Vin Barone described a new proposal with dedicated curbside loading and minimal traffic diversions. The city’s earlier pledge for 20 new miles of bus lanes per year has not been met. Eighty-five thousand daily bus riders, many vulnerable, remain at risk on slow, crowded streets.

Yet their state rakes in billions from MTA contracts. The plan will raise $15 billion for transit. Jersey firms stand to gain more. Lawsuits loom. Money and politics collide. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2023, a report surfaced in Streetsblog NYC detailing the debate over MTA congestion pricing. The report, titled "New Jersey May See Red over Congestion Pricing, but Garden State Gets Plenty of MTA Green," highlights that from 2014 to 2022, the MTA paid New Jersey companies $3.3 billion for goods and services. The plan, set to raise $15 billion for the MTA's 2020-2024 capital plan, faces opposition from New Jersey officials, including Governor Phil Murphy, who have threatened lawsuits. The article quotes Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany: "Congestion pricing will bring in $15 billion alone for the MTA's $55 billion 2020-2024 capital plan, and New Jersey businesses stand to profit from this major increase in MTA capital spending." MTA spokesperson Eugene Resnick adds that congestion pricing will "reduce traffic, improve regional air quality, and boost the Garden State's economy." Despite the political fight, the money keeps flowing. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the system prioritizes contracts and capital over street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Connections to the ferry and boardwalk improved.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2023, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) marked the completion of a major infrastructure project in Rockaway. The work, running from Beach Channel Drive to Shore Front Parkway, added porous pavement, new bike lanes, and wider pedestrian walkways. The city says the 11,000 square feet of new surface can absorb nearly 1.3 million gallons of stormwater each year. Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes. The changes give cyclists and pedestrians an easier, safer route to the Rockaway ferry terminal and boardwalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

These vehicles are not small—they are right-sized. Cars, SUVs, and trucks are oversized and deadly. Language shapes danger. Words matter. Human-scaled mobility deserves respect, not diminishment.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published June 12, 2023, on Streetsblog NYC, challenges the use of the term ‘micromobility’ to describe bikes, scooters, and similar vehicles. The article argues, ‘SUVs, pick-up trucks, and passenger cars should not be the benchmark by which we judge the size of other forms of transit, and the term 'micromobility' encourages us to believe that they are.’ Author Sarah Risser calls for dropping the ‘micro’ prefix, urging us to see bikes and scooters as standard, not lesser. She highlights how oversized vehicles—cars, SUVs, trucks—fuel rising deaths among pedestrians and cyclists. Risser urges language that centers human-scaled mobility and rejects car supremacy. No council bill or vote is attached, but the stance is clear: words shape safety, and the right words can help dismantle systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation will conduct a traffic study before starting the environmental review, pushing construction to late 2027. The matter, titled 'City delays BQE construction to conduct traffic study, says roadway is ‘safe’ amid interim repairs,' highlights the city’s claim that interim repairs will keep the road safe until at least 2028. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, voiced concern about the delay and the city’s ability to finish the project. Community Visioning Council members were not told in advance. Residents and advocates worry about the crumbling structure and lack of transparency.

Council Member Hanif hosted a recent event on the issue. The committees unanimously approved the DOT proposal with conditions: more pedestrian safety, more traffic calming, and a comprehensive plan for all of Ninth Street. DOT has not set a timeline.

Treyger celebrated the start on social media, thanking advocates. Jon Orcutt of Bike New York criticized Parks for slow, unsafe detour practices, saying, 'They should be working on it based on function.'

He says it could break the political deadlock. The plan keeps most benefits: less traffic, faster buses, more transit cash. Regular drivers would pay more. Occasional drivers get a break.</p><p class=mb3>On April 26, 2023, Charles Komanoff proposed a policy tweak to New York’s stalled congestion pricing plan. The plan, passed by the state legislature in 2019, remains stuck in federal review. Komanoff suggests, 'let’s give every household in the 12-county MTA region a single untolled trip per month into the congestion zone.' He argues this would address fairness concerns and soften opposition from occasional drivers. The freebie would cut annual net revenues by $110 million, but Komanoff says this could be offset by raising tolls for regular commuters. The proposal aims to preserve congestion pricing’s core goals: less traffic, faster travel, and more funding for transit. Komanoff’s compromise seeks to break the political stalemate and keep the city moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
