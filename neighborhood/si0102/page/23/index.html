The plan requires 20 miles of new bus lanes in 2022 and 150 miles by 2026. The article states: 'Mayor Eric Adams has only presented three bus lane projects totaling about 14.6 miles as the painting season begins.' Only three out of 22 locations have timelines. Advocates like Riders Alliance and Ashley Pryce voice frustration: 'Mayor Adams promised 150 miles of new bus lanes. So far, he's at 0.' DOT claims support but offers no concrete schedule. Council members are not directly named, but the pressure comes from advocacy groups demanding urgent action. The lack of progress leaves bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—waiting in slow traffic, exposed to danger and delay.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Urgency grows. No more excuses.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2022, the City Council’s Sanitation Committee, chaired by Council Member Sandy Nurse, held a hearing on the delayed implementation of commercial waste zones, a reform established by a 2019 law. The matter, titled 'Advocates Warn Against Further Delays on Commercial Waste Zones,' drew sharp criticism after the Department of Sanitation granted private carters a three-month extension to comply with new requirements. Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, said, 'Commercial waste zone reform can not come fast enough.' The hearing underscored that every delay keeps vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The toolkit, described as a guide for 'city approvals needed for plazas, sidewalk furniture, parklets, open streets and other amenities that enable successful pedestrianization and placemaking,' calls for unified permits, sliding fees, and an inter-agency Public Realm Working Group. Matthew Clarke, executive director, said, 'Public spaces and the small businesses that define them are critical for the livelihood of our neighborhoods.' Jackson Chabot of Open Plans added, 'These systemic changes will foster safe streets, commerce, and community.' The report highlights decades of city neglect, favoring car storage over people.

The city’s plan keeps eight car lanes, weak bike protection, and slow buses. Cyclists dodge cars. Bus riders wait. Drivers rule. Real safety demands fewer car lanes, center bus lanes, and true bike barriers.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published April 26, 2022, calls out the Department of Transportation’s plan for Queens Boulevard. The plan, part of the 'Great Streets' project, keeps eight car lanes and installs only lightly protected bike lanes with mountable curbs. Samuel Santaella, the author, writes: 'the department has discriminated against thousands of bikers and 13,630 pre-pandemic daily bus riders in order to privilege the needs of 40,000 daily motorists.' Santaella opposes the current DOT plan and urges a redesign: reduce car lanes to four, add center-running bus lanes, fully separated bikeways, and wider sidewalks. He warns that mountable curbs let drivers invade bike lanes, putting cyclists at risk. Bus riders see little benefit, still stuck behind double-parked cars. The piece demands the city stop favoring drivers and start protecting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, part of ongoing budget talks, aims to fund hundreds of miles of protected bike and bus lanes, plus concrete barriers. Council Member Lincoln Restler of District 33, a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, praised the move as 'a very clear commitment to addressing street safety across the five boroughs.' The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists. The Council had requested $3.1 billion, but Restler called the $900 million a dramatic investment.

Decades of rising car ownership brought longer, not shorter, trips. Streets stay dangerous. Pollution and risk fall hardest on communities of color. The answer is not more cars. It is safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, released April 20, 2022, reviews a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The report, titled 'Study: Car Ownership Doesn’t Always Cut Black Workers’ Commutes,' finds that despite an increase in car ownership among Black workers—from 76% in 1980 to 85% in 2019—average commute times grew longer, not shorter. The study states, 'it may not be possible to speed up city commutes with automotive strategies alone.' The gap in commute times between Black and White workers persists, especially in large, segregated cities. The article warns that subsidizing driving will make streets more polluted and dangerous, with the heaviest toll on communities of color. It calls for investment in bus rapid transit, trains, and active transportation, and for building communities where jobs and housing are close. No council member is named; this is a research release, not a legislative action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, part of the council’s response to the mayor’s $98.5 billion preliminary budget, seeks to expand protected bike lanes to 500 miles, bus lanes to 500 miles, and add 38 million feet of pedestrian space. The council’s plan also introduces 40 miles of car-free busways, a benchmark not found in the mayor’s plan or previous legislation. Adams and other council leaders argue this funding is vital, stating, 'To secure an equitable recovery for our city and improve public safety, we must focus on robust investments.'

The E-BIKE Act, once part of the Build Back Better Act, proposed a federal tax credit for e-bike buyers. Congress reduced the credit from $1,500 to $900 and limited eligibility, stalling progress. The article states, 'By replacing car trips, e-bikes can simultaneously lower emissions, improve street safety, and boost riders' health.' John MacArthur, a transportation program manager, notes that local and state lawmakers now lead with rebates and incentives. Council members and legislators in Vermont, Colorado, California, Washington, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have introduced or supported bills for e-bike rebates. Despite the momentum, no current state proposal pairs incentives with new bike infrastructure.

City officials stay silent.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2022, cycling groups Bike New York and Bike South Brooklyn sounded the alarm over the crumbling Ocean Parkway bike path in Brooklyn. In a letter to the Parks Department and Department of Transportation, they wrote: "Asphalt is heaving and cracking at many points from the northern end of the bikeway to Avenue R... These conditions will worsen as long as they are not repaired or addressed." The advocates criticized the slow pace of repairs, noting the southern section will not be fixed until 2023. Jon Orcutt, Bike New York Advocacy Director, said, "Parks' inability to move projects like these or stay ahead of decay poses big problems for an expanded citywide greenway system." The letter urges long-term maintenance plans and calls for safer slip street designs, demanding drivers stop before crossing bike lanes. No city officials responded. The advocates cite a recent cyclist fatality as proof of the deadly risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City agencies patched the hole only after his death. The repair was rushed and uneven. The hazard remains. The city failed to protect cyclists. No answers given.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2022, city agencies responded to the death of Lin Wen-Chiang, 77, who was killed after his bike struck a caved-in section of 40th Drive in Elmhurst, Queens. The matter, titled 'City Covers Up Failure After Cyclist Death, With Hastily Made Repairs After Months of 311 Complaints,' details how residents filed at least eight 311 complaints to the Department of Transportation and 14 to the Department of Environmental Protection since 2019. Both agencies failed to fix the hazard. Only after Wen-Chiang’s death did city workers patch the road, but the repair was rushed and left uneven, creating a new danger. DOT spokesman Vin Barone called it 'a tragedy' and said an investigation is underway. DEP claimed the subsurface infrastructure was sound. No council members are named. The city’s neglect cost a life and left the street unsafe for cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates want less talk, more action. They demand bus lanes, bike lanes, and fewer cars. Transportation emissions barely dropped in 15 years. Car ownership climbs. The city’s climate targets slip further away.</p><p class=mb3>On February 2, 2022, Mayor Adams announced his new climate team, appointing Rohit Aggarwala as Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner and Chief Climate Officer, and Kizzy Charles-Guzman as executive director of the Mayor's Office of Climate and Environmental Justice. The announcement, covered by Streetsblog NYC, focused on broad climate issues. Advocates, including Jaqi Cohen and Kevin Garcia, pressed the new office to prioritize transportation emissions, quoting, 'improving transit options and creating access for environmental justice communities, while also curbing harmful diesel emissions.' Aggarwala voiced support for congestion pricing, pedestrianization, and bus lanes, promising collaboration with the Department of Transportation. Transportation emissions have dropped only 5% since 2007, while car ownership rises. Advocates urge the climate team to work with DOT on bus and bike lanes, last-mile delivery, and cargo bikes to meet climate and justice goals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
