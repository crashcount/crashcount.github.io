Thirteen left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In Canarsie, from 2022 to June 2025, the streets have not been kind. Nearly 1,700 people hurt. The numbers do not soften. They do not blink. They only rise.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians pay the highest price.</strong> A 14-year-old boy, crushed at an intersection. An elderly man, struck crossing Rockaway Parkway. A woman, killed on Avenue L. Each death is a family broken, a chair left empty, a name turned to a number.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans are the main weapons.</strong> Of the vehicles that killed or maimed pedestrians here, 7 were cars or SUVs, 1 was a truck, none were bikes. The pattern is clear. The threat is heavy, fast, and steel.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They have the law. They have the power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Canarsie, the limit stands. The silence is loud.</p><p>When the police swarm after a crash, the city notices. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Oh my god, another, like, 10 just flew by.

The council can demand safer crossings. The state can keep speed cameras running. But none of it matters if leaders wait.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The bill authorizes the mayor, on the police commissioner's recommendation, to offer up to $1,000 for actionable tips. Law enforcement and city or state employees are excluded. The bill responds to the grim fact that many hit-and-runs go unsolved, leaving victims and families without answers. It aims to break the code of silence and help bring reckless drivers to justice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Narcisse sponsored the measure, which aims to prevent drivers from receiving several summonses for a single bus lane offense. The bill does not address the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, or bus riders. No safety analyst has found a benefit for vulnerable road users.
