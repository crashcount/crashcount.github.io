The law orders the Department of Transportation to post current bicycle and micromobility ridership data online, updated monthly or at least yearly. The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Restler, Hudson, Schulman, and others. The law demands transparency on where riders travel and what DOT does to keep them safe. This opens the books on bike movement and exposes gaps in protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, proposed by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, seeks to end criminal penalties for crossing streets outside crosswalks. The matter summary states officials argue, 'keeping it illegal protects pedestrian safety.' DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione testified against full legalization, supporting only a reduction to a civil offense. NYPD Deputy Chief Thomas Alps defended targeted enforcement in high-crash areas. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the law's fairness, noting most tickets go to Black and Brown New Yorkers. Advocates criticized the city's stance, saying criminalization does not improve safety and harms communities of color.

The measure heads to its first hearing before the transportation committee. Narcisse’s bill responds to city data: in 2023, 92 percent of jaywalking summonses went to Black or Latino New Yorkers; in early 2024, that number rose to 96.5 percent. Narcisse calls this 'a troubling picture of racial disparities.' She states, 'Jaywalking should not be a criminal matter that disproportionately impacts certain groups based on race or ethnicity.' Narcisse urges the city to redirect police resources and end selective enforcement. The bill aims to protect the rights of all residents and promote equity in city policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A sedan traveling south went straight ahead while an e-bike, also heading south, was making a right turn. The point of impact was the sedan’s right front bumper and the e-bike’s left front bumper. The e-bike rider, a 34-year-old male, sustained injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot, and was reported to be in shock with complaints of pain or nausea. The report cites "Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion" and "Unsafe Lane Changing" as contributing factors. The sedan driver, a licensed female from Florida, was alone in the vehicle, which sustained no damage. The e-bike rider was not ejected and wore a helmet. The report highlights driver errors related to unsafe lane changing and confusion but does not assign blame to the injured e-bike rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
