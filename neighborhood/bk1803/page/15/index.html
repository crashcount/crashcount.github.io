Who Will Stop It?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 4, 2025 <em>(Revised July 10, 2025 – Updated period stats)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Canarsie: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 4, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>Twelve dead. Thirteen left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In Canarsie, from 2022 to June 2025, the streets have not been kind. Nearly 1,700 people hurt. The numbers do not soften. They do not blink. They only rise.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians pay the highest price.</strong> A 14-year-old boy, crushed at an intersection. An elderly man, struck crossing Rockaway Parkway. A woman, killed on Avenue L. Each death is a family broken, a chair left empty, a name turned to a number.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans are the main weapons.</strong> Of the vehicles that killed or maimed pedestrians here, 7 were cars or SUVs, 1 was a truck, none were bikes. The pattern is clear. The threat is heavy, fast, and steel.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They have the law. They have the power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Canarsie, the limit stands. The silence is loud.</p><p>When the police swarm after a crash, the city notices. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Oh my god, another, like, 10 just flew by. You know, 30 cops, oh my god, 40 cops, that&rsquo;s insane.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/belt-parkway-brooklyn-nypd-shooting/>said Doris Isakov</a>. The response is swift after the blood is spilled. The prevention is slow.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit. The council can demand safer crossings. The state can keep speed cameras running. But none of it matters if leaders wait.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets where children can cross and come home.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill aimed to amend city law to require the Department of Transportation to finish all street resurfacing work within two weeks. If more time was needed, the department would have to notify the community, stating the reason and new timeline. The matter summary reads: 'ensure that all work associated with the resurfacing of any street is finalized within 2 weeks from the start of work.' Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by thirty other members. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst reviewed the impact, but torn-up streets are a known threat to pedestrians and cyclists. The bill is dead.

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people.
