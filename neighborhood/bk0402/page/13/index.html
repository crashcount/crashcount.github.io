In the last year alone, two people died. <strong>232 were injured.</strong> Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared. Sixteen under 18 were hurt in the past year.

They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and lower speed limits. But in Bushwick (East), the blood keeps flowing. <strong>Crashes are down, but injuries are not.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders have not done enough.</strong> The laws are slow. The changes crawl. The silence is loud. There is no record of bold action from those who hold power here. No flood of press releases. No urgent votes. The streets remain the same. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes.

Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi claimed some locals want three lanes each way, but 17 elected officials, including State Sen. Julia Salazar, Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, and Council Member Lincoln Restler, publicly rejected the idea. Salazar said, 'no to three lanes. Two lanes at most.' Gounardes confirmed, 'all support a two-lane highway.' Gallagher wrote, '2 lanes if any.' Restler called City Hall’s statements 'plainly inaccurate.' The Department of Transportation delayed environmental review to study both options. Advocates and officials urge investment in mass transit, not highway expansion.

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) admitted the overhaul would not start until late 2024, with citywide coverage years away. The matter, described as a fix for a 'free-for-all system that led to reckless driving and fatalities,' remains stalled. Council Members Lincoln Restler and Julie Menin pressed DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch on the slow pace and shifting deadlines. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who introduced the original legislation, stressed the need for clear guidance. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure highlighted the deadly consequences of delay. DSNY opposes a bill from Council Member Sandy Nurse to create a working group to address these setbacks.
