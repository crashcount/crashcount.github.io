Thirteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been <strong>1,661 crashes</strong>. <strong>824 people hurt.</strong></p><p>A 71-year-old woman, crossing in a marked crosswalk, never made it to the other side. A 29-year-old passenger, ejected and crushed. A 49-year-old e-bike rider, thrown and killed by a turning truck. The dead do not speak. The living limp on.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> Vans, SUVs, sedans, trucks—they strike the body and keep moving. In the last year alone, two people died. <strong>232 were injured.</strong> Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared. Sixteen under 18 were hurt in the past year. The young and the old, both broken on the same streets.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and lower speed limits. But in Bushwick (East), the blood keeps flowing. <strong>Crashes are down, but injuries are not.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders have not done enough.</strong> The laws are slow. The changes crawl. The silence is loud. There is no record of bold action from those who hold power here. No flood of press releases. No urgent votes. The streets remain the same. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand enforcement that protects the walker, not the driver. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
