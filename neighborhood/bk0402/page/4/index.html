In the last year alone, two people died. <strong>232 were injured.</strong> Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared.

They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and lower speed limits. But in Bushwick (East), the blood keeps flowing. <strong>Crashes are down, but injuries are not.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders have not done enough.</strong> The laws are slow. The changes crawl. The silence is loud. There is no record of bold action from those who hold power here. No flood of press releases. No urgent votes. The streets remain the same. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The rider, 42, helmeted, was thrown and crushed.' The e-scooter rider suffered crush injuries to the entire body and was ejected from the vehicle but remained conscious. The police report explicitly lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, indicating the taxi driver failed to obey traffic signals. The narrative underscores that 'signals [were] ignored.' The e-scooter rider was wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary cause cited is the taxi driver’s disregard for traffic control. The crash left the scooter folded and the cab’s front quarter crumpled, marking another instance where systemic driver error endangered a vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
