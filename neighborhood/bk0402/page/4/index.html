In the last year alone, two people died. <strong>232 were injured.</strong> Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared. Sixteen under 18 were hurt in the past year.

They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and lower speed limits. But in Bushwick (East), the blood keeps flowing. <strong>Crashes are down, but injuries are not.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders have not done enough.</strong> The laws are slow. The changes crawl. The silence is loud. There is no record of bold action from those who hold power here. No flood of press releases. No urgent votes. The streets remain the same. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes.

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike. The bill has not yet received a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
