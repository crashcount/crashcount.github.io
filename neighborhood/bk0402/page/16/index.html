Thirteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been <strong>1,661 crashes</strong>. <strong>824 people hurt.</strong></p><p>A 71-year-old woman, crossing in a marked crosswalk, never made it to the other side. A 29-year-old passenger, ejected and crushed. A 49-year-old e-bike rider, thrown and killed by a turning truck. The dead do not speak. The living limp on.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> Vans, SUVs, sedans, trucks—they strike the body and keep moving. In the last year alone, two people died. <strong>232 were injured.</strong> Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared. Sixteen under 18 were hurt in the past year.

But in Bushwick (East), the blood keeps flowing. <strong>Crashes are down, but injuries are not.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders have not done enough.</strong> The laws are slow. The changes crawl. The silence is loud. There is no record of bold action from those who hold power here. No flood of press releases. No urgent votes. The streets remain the same. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes.

The Assembly passed it on June 6, the Senate on June 8. Patricia Fahy sponsored the bill. The measure allows speed cameras in school zones, aiming to catch drivers who speed near children. The program ends December 31, 2028. Many lawmakers voted yes, some no.

Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way. The bill targets that risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
