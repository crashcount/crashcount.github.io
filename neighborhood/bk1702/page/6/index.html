Nine left with serious injuries.</strong> In East Flatbush-Farragut, from January 2022 to June 2025, the street keeps taking. In the last year alone, 255 crashes. <strong>183 people hurt. Four with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> Not one month without pain.

A 50-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, hit by a truck on Clarendon Road. A 61-year-old man, thrown from his bike, left bleeding in the street. The list goes on.

The numbers show it: cars and SUVs caused the only death and most injuries. Trucks and mopeds left others broken.

They promise lower speed limits and more cameras. But in East Flatbush-Farragut, the blood keeps coming. The council and state passed Sammy’s Law, giving the city power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The cameras could go dark if Albany stalls. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is failure.</strong> Every crash is a choice. Every delay is a wound. The city can lower the speed limit now.

The city waits for action.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 0264-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on February 28, 2024. The measure, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the establishment of a parking enforcement unit within the department of transportation,' would require DOT to create a dedicated parking enforcement unit. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Joseph, Feliz, Louis, Marte, Won, Salaam, Farías, Riley, Bottcher, and Hudson. The bill aims to enforce laws and rules on parking violations. No safety analyst has yet assessed its impact on vulnerable road users. The bill remains under committee review, with no vote or enactment date set.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
