The driver, Bekim Fiseku, was wanted for burglary and had tape over his license plate. Police chased him nearly a mile through residential streets. A witness said, "She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force." The article highlights concerns about NYPD's pursuit tactics, quoting the victim's father: "It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood." Fiseku faces murder and manslaughter charges. The case raises questions about the risks of police chases in dense city neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

MTA workers get a pass for driving in bus lanes while on duty. Law shields agency vehicles from tickets. Streets grow more crowded. Vulnerable users face more risk.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 6815, titled 'Relates to bus lane restrictions in New York city,' passed the Senate on June 12, 2025, and the Assembly on June 13, 2025. The bill states, 'it shall be a defense to any prosecution for a violation of a bus lane restriction ... when an employee of the metropolitan transportation authority is performing authorized duties.' Sponsored by Senator Leroy Comrie and co-sponsored by Nathalia Fernandez, the measure exempts MTA employees from bus lane tickets while working. No safety analysis was provided. The bill opens bus lanes to more agency vehicles, crowding space meant for buses, cyclists, and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
