Since 2022, six people have died and 1,137 have been injured in crashes in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Ten of those injuries were serious. The dead include a 41-year-old man crushed on the Van Wyck, a 33-year-old woman struck on the Grand Central Parkway, and a 63-year-old woman thrown from her moped on Blossom Avenue. The park is ringed by highways. The danger is constant.</p><p>Buses jump curbs. Cars mount sidewalks. On July 11, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb and smashed into a light pole and ticket machine, injuring eight. One rider <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>described the chaos</a>: &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo; The driver, just 25, told investigators he misjudged the curb. Video later showed he had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. The crash could have killed. It did not. This time.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The most vulnerable bleed first. Pedestrians, cyclists, and moped riders are struck by SUVs, trucks, and buses. In the last twelve months, 367 people were hurt and one killed in 449 crashes. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, mothers, children. A woman on a moped, ejected and left bleeding. A man walking, crushed by a truck. A passenger, dead from a head wound after a sedan slammed a parked rig. The park is a magnet for families. The roads around it are a trap.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Senator John Liu has voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. He co-sponsored the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst offenders to install speed limiters. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The MTA pulls a driver after a crash, but the system that put him there remains. &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said a bystander</a>. The devastation is routine.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. These deaths are not accidents. They are the result of choices. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars. The park should be a place for families, not funerals. The time to act is now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff. This is basic transit maintenance.” Liu said losing congestion pricing would erase a billion dollars in annual MTA revenue, threatening $15 billion in planned upgrades. The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily. Both officials opposed the repeal, highlighting the risk to the city’s transit backbone.

The crash occurred at 11:35 a.m. The report states the SUV driver was 'distracted' and that 'alcohol was involved.' The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'other actions in roadway,' but the police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The SUV's right front bumper delivered the fatal blow, crushing the man's body. The police narrative describes the victim's death as immediate, with his body 'crumpled beneath the wheels.' No contributing factors are attributed to the pedestrian. The data underscores the lethal consequences of driver distraction and impairment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
