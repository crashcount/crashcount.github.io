Four seriously injured.</strong> In Baisley Park, the numbers do not soften with time. Since 2022, there have been <strong>1,265 crashes</strong>. <strong>744 people hurt.</strong> The dead are not coming back. The injured carry scars you cannot see. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Children are not spared. <strong>88 kids injured</strong> in three years.

Trucks and buses added to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds left one moderate injury. No one was killed by a bike, but the threat from heavy metal rolling fast is always there.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are hit hardest. A man crossing Linden Boulevard, not at a crosswalk, was left semiconscious by an SUV. A cyclist ejected from his bike on 155th Street. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city passed <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong>, giving New York the power to lower speed limits. But the limit in Baisley Park is not yet 20 mph. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Laws are passed, but change comes slow. The city says it is committed to Vision Zero. The dead and injured wait for proof.</p><p>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No council vote has forced the limit down. No press conference has named the children hurt here. <strong>Delay is a choice.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 30-year-old male bicyclist traveling north was struck by a 2009 Honda SUV making a right turn eastbound. The point of impact was the SUV’s right front quarter panel and the bike’s center front end. The bicyclist sustained a neck injury classified as severity level 3 and complained of whiplash but remained conscious and was not ejected. The report explicitly cites the SUV driver’s failure to yield right-of-way and driver inattention/distraction as contributing factors. No damage was reported to either vehicle. The bicyclist was not wearing safety equipment, but the report does not list this as a contributing factor. The crash highlights the dangers posed by driver errors during turning maneuvers in Queens.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The street remains unchanged.</p><p class=mb3>According to the NY Daily News (2025-03-04), Justin Diaz, 23, was killed when an off-duty FDNY firefighter, Michael Pena, sped through a red light at 83 mph in a 25 mph zone and struck Diaz’s BMW at 107th St. and Northern Blvd. Diaz was heading to work at LaGuardia Airport. Prosecutors say Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and refused a breath test. His blood-alcohol content was 0.156 percent. Surveillance footage confirmed Diaz had the right-of-way. The article notes, 'The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light, prosecutors say.' Pena was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. His license was suspended.
