Trucks and buses added to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds left one moderate injury. No one was killed by a bike, but the threat from heavy metal rolling fast is always there.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are hit hardest. A man crossing Linden Boulevard, not at a crosswalk, was left semiconscious by an SUV. A cyclist ejected from his bike on 155th Street. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city passed <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong>, giving New York the power to lower speed limits. But the limit in Baisley Park is not yet 20 mph. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Laws are passed, but change comes slow. The city says it is committed to Vision Zero. The dead and injured wait for proof.</p><p>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No council vote has forced the limit down. No press conference has named the children hurt here. <strong>Delay is a choice.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The Council, led by Speaker Adrienne Adams, is advancing a bill for a permanent program but wants to limit roadway dining to warmer months. The matter, described as a push to 'keep outdoor dining in the roadway year-round,' drew sharp criticism from small business owners and open space advocates. Donna Drakes, Felicia Park-Rogers, and Charlotta Janssen spoke out against seasonal limits, citing high costs and lost public space. Matthew Clarke of the Design Trust for Public Space urged the Council to keep the program under DOT and rethink street use. The Council has not finalized the bill. Discussions continue.

The measure, expected before lawmakers next month, keeps sidewalk dining year-round but limits curbside 'streeteries' to warmer months. Council Member Justin Brannan said, 'The plan is not to make permanent the current outdoor dining sheds you see on our streets ... but to create a better program with new rules, new standards, clear design guidelines and operating requirements.' Speaker Adrienne Adams leads the Council in fine-tuning the bill, while Mayor Adams supports Department of Transportation oversight. Council Member Marjorie Velázquez’s original bill would have shifted control to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans argue, 'A year-round option is an absolute must.' The bill responds to complaints about noise, rats, and lost parking, but also credits the program with saving 100,000 jobs. The Council’s move reshapes public space, but the safety impact for pedestrians and cyclists remains unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams stated, 'The increase in traffic fatalities since 2018 is alarming, particularly the rise in children killed by traffic violence.' The report highlights that the city is not on pace to meet the 2019 Streets Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of bus lanes in five years. Disparities in hit-and-run arrests remain stark between white neighborhoods and neighborhoods of color.

Outdoor dining spread to 17 neighborhoods that never had it. Blue-collar districts of color gained most. Manhattan’s dominance faded. Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx doubled their share. The fight now: who controls the future.</p><p class=mb3>On January 19, 2023, a new report detailed the impact of New York City’s pandemic-era open restaurants program. The program, debated in the Council and championed by Speaker Adrienne Adams, brought outdoor dining to 17 community boards previously shut out by high fees and red tape. The report states, 'Dining in all neighborhoods [should be] a permanent part of the city’s streetscape.' Brooklyn’s share of outdoor dining rose from 16% to 25%, while Manhattan’s dropped from 70% to 49%. Queens and the Bronx doubled their share. Speaker Adams opposes dining sheds in the roadway and seeks to shift oversight from DOT to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Advocates warn DCWP lacks resources and fear a return to restrictive rules. DOT supports keeping the process simple and affordable, citing equity and vibrant streets. The Council’s decision will shape who benefits—and who is left out.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (District 28) featured prominently, voicing support for parking over curbside sheds during the outdoor dining debate. The summary, published December 27, 2022, highlights pledges to fortify 100 miles of bike lanes and make 1,000 intersections safer. The MTA settled lawsuits to make 95% of subway stations ADA compliant by 2055. The city exceeded its intersection safety goal, and the state approved 24/7 speed cameras. Adams’s stance on parking signals a preference for car storage over expanded public space, a move that can limit safety gains for pedestrians and cyclists. The review underscores a year of mixed progress: new safety measures, but persistent threats for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jamaica Avenue hours slashed. Archer stays 24/7. Northern Boulevard bus lanes started after months of delay. Local politicians fought restrictions. Bus riders still face slow trips. City bows to business pressure.</p><p class=mb3>On November 15, 2022, the Adams administration made busways on Jamaica and Archer avenues permanent after a one-year pilot. The Department of Transportation cut Jamaica Avenue’s busway hours from 24/7 to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, while Archer Avenue remains round-the-clock. The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
