Elected officials say the move closes a transit gap. Riders in Rockaway face long commutes. The pilot brings cheaper, faster access. Some ticket purchase restrictions remain.</p><p class=mb3>On May 5, 2023, the MTA announced it will expand the $5 City Ticket fare to Far Rockaway LIRR riders. This policy, supported by Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, State Senator James Sanders, Jr., Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson, and City Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, addresses a long-standing exclusion in the city's transit network. The City Ticket allows travel within city limits on LIRR or Metro-North for $5 during off-peak and weekend hours. Richards called the move a win for 'transit equity.' Anderson highlighted that Rockaway has the city's longest commutes, and this change will help. Brooks-Powers urged further expansion and easier transfers. The pilot, part of upcoming fare changes, still restricts where tickets can be bought, a flaw officials promise to address. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, named for 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, would let New York City lower speed limits below 25 mph. The bill failed to enter the 2023 state budget, shifting responsibility to the City Council. In 2021, the Council backed a home rule message 42-6, but the Assembly blocked it. Last year, the Council reversed course and failed to pass the message. This session, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, with 10 sponsors. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers must hold a hearing before a vote. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Brooks-Powers have not signed on, citing negotiations. The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.' Data show slower speeds save lives. Advocates and victims’ families keep pushing. The Council’s inaction keeps streets dangerous.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measures, now headed to Mayor Eric Adams, require the Department of Transportation to report on traffic violence more often and to install traffic calming devices in areas with many senior pedestrians. The matter summary reads: 'Traffic calming devices that are designed to slow down traffic will now be mandated in parts of the five boroughs where a large number of senior citizens reside as the city plans to speed up part of its response to serious and fatal car crashes.' Speaker Adrienne Adams voted for the bills, stating, 'It's important that the Council advance equitable policies like the legislation we're voting on today to ensure that all New Yorkers can live, work and commute on safer streets.' Councilmember Rita C. Joseph, sponsor of the senior zones bill, said, 'It is our duty as this Council to take action to protect our most vulnerable residents.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, sponsor of the crash data bill, said the legislation 'would increase transparency, aid collaboration and help prevent traffic violence.'

Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, co-sponsored by Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler.

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.

Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On April 5, 2023, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (District 28) responded to a report showing New York City is owed more than $1 billion in unpaid parking and speeding fines. The Independent Budget Office found $1.02 billion in unpaid traffic fines from 2017 to 2022, including camera tickets for speeding and red lights. The matter, titled 'Ticket to slide: NYC owed more than $1 billion in unpaid parking, speeding fines, report finds,' highlights growing debt as enforcement lags. Adams, along with Comptroller Brad Lander, criticized further city agency budget cuts, urging the city to collect owed fines instead. The report notes that while 24/7 school-zone speed cameras have reduced speeding, the city has failed to stop drivers from evading cameras with defaced or fake plates—letting dangerous drivers escape accountability. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, expected before lawmakers next month, keeps sidewalk dining year-round but limits curbside 'streeteries' to warmer months. Council Member Justin Brannan said, 'The plan is not to make permanent the current outdoor dining sheds you see on our streets ... but to create a better program with new rules, new standards, clear design guidelines and operating requirements.' Speaker Adrienne Adams leads the Council in fine-tuning the bill, while Mayor Adams supports Department of Transportation oversight. Council Member Marjorie Velázquez’s original bill would have shifted control to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans argue, 'A year-round option is an absolute must.' The bill responds to complaints about noise, rats, and lost parking, but also credits the program with saving 100,000 jobs.
