Four seriously injured.</strong> In Baisley Park, the numbers do not soften with time. Since 2022, there have been <strong>1,265 crashes</strong>. <strong>744 people hurt.</strong> The dead are not coming back. The injured carry scars you cannot see. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Children are not spared. <strong>88 kids injured</strong> in three years.

Trucks and buses added to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds left one moderate injury. No one was killed by a bike, but the threat from heavy metal rolling fast is always there.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are hit hardest. A man crossing Linden Boulevard, not at a crosswalk, was left semiconscious by an SUV. A cyclist ejected from his bike on 155th Street. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city passed <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong>, giving New York the power to lower speed limits. But the limit in Baisley Park is not yet 20 mph. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Laws are passed, but change comes slow. The city says it is committed to Vision Zero. The dead and injured wait for proof.</p><p>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No council vote has forced the limit down. No press conference has named the children hurt here. <strong>Delay is a choice.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.
