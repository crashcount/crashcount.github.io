Four seriously injured.</strong> In Baisley Park, the numbers do not soften with time. Since 2022, there have been <strong>1,265 crashes</strong>. <strong>744 people hurt.</strong> The dead are not coming back.

Trucks and buses added to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds left one moderate injury. No one was killed by a bike, but the threat from heavy metal rolling fast is always there.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are hit hardest. A man crossing Linden Boulevard, not at a crosswalk, was left semiconscious by an SUV. A cyclist ejected from his bike on 155th Street. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city passed <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong>, giving New York the power to lower speed limits. But the limit in Baisley Park is not yet 20 mph. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Laws are passed, but change comes slow. The city says it is committed to Vision Zero. The dead and injured wait for proof.</p><p>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No council vote has forced the limit down. No press conference has named the children hurt here. <strong>Delay is a choice.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

This policy, supported by Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, State Senator James Sanders, Jr., Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson, and City Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, addresses a long-standing exclusion in the city's transit network. The City Ticket allows travel within city limits on LIRR or Metro-North for $5 during off-peak and weekend hours. Richards called the move a win for 'transit equity.' Anderson highlighted that Rockaway has the city's longest commutes, and this change will help. Brooks-Powers urged further expansion and easier transfers. The pilot, part of upcoming fare changes, still restricts where tickets can be bought, a flaw officials promise to address.
