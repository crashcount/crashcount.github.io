Three seriously hurt.</strong> Four hundred sixty-three injured. These are not numbers from a war zone. They are the toll of traffic violence in Todt Hill-Emerson Hill-Lighthouse Hill-Manor Heights since 2022. The dead do not come back. The injured carry scars. In the last year alone, 148 people were hurt in 262 crashes. One lost a limb. One never made it home.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A 69-year-old man was killed by a bus on Platinum Avenue. He was crossing, not at an intersection. The bus turned left. The man died where he fell. No warning, no second chance. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> confirms the toll.</p><p>A 39-year-old man lost his leg to a truck on Sparkhill Avenue. He was working in the road. The truck slowed, but not enough. The street did not forgive.

In June 2025, Mayor Eric Adams stood in Staten Island and watched a bulldozer crush 200 illegal mopeds. He <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>said New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, because we hear it all the time, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.</a> The city links these vehicles to crime and fear, but the crackdown swept up delivery workers and even a Citi Bike. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/super-smash-nyc-destroys-mopeds-e-bikes-as-mayor-celebrates-illegal-vehicle-crackdown>said this morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them.</a></p><p>But the numbers show the main killers are still cars, trucks, and buses. The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can protect the people who walk and ride. <strong>It has not done enough.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower speed limits, redesign deadly streets, and protect the vulnerable. Demand action before another name becomes a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill’s matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to develop a map of bicycle infrastructure conditions.' Council Member Crystal Hudson sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Sanchez, Stevens, Yeger, Restler, Avilés, and others.

No change.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 1120-2023, filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, aimed to force the Department of Transportation to assess at least 100 speed camera locations per year for raised speed reducer feasibility. Introduced July 13, 2023, and sponsored by Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Kevin C. Riley, Kalman Yeger, Amanda Farías, and David M. Carr, the measure required DOT to install raised speed reducers within a year where feasible, then report annually on danger indicators and recommend if cameras should remain. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No raised speed reducers will be installed under this law. Vulnerable road users remain exposed at these crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed in the Assembly, faces suburban resistance. Carroll’s statement, titled "When It Comes to Transit, Everyone Must Pay Their Fair Share," argues that exempting suburbs would cost the MTA $325 million and undermine regional transit. Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the statement centers on funding the transit system that protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
