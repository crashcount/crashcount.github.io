Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> confirms the toll.</p><p>A 39-year-old man lost his leg to a truck on Sparkhill Avenue. He was working in the road. The truck slowed, but not enough. The street did not forgive. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> record is clear.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have watched the blood run.</strong> They have also acted, but not always for the most vulnerable. In June 2025, Mayor Eric Adams stood in Staten Island and watched a bulldozer crush 200 illegal mopeds. He <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>said New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, because we hear it all the time, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.</a> The city links these vehicles to crime and fear, but the crackdown swept up delivery workers and even a Citi Bike. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/super-smash-nyc-destroys-mopeds-e-bikes-as-mayor-celebrates-illegal-vehicle-crackdown>said this morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them.</a></p><p>But the numbers show the main killers are still cars, trucks, and buses. The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can protect the people who walk and ride. <strong>It has not done enough.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower speed limits, redesign deadly streets, and protect the vulnerable. Demand action before another name becomes a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The 30-year-old motorcycle rider, helmeted, was ejected from his bike and rendered unconscious after his head hit the pavement. The report details that the crash occurred as both vehicles traveled straight ahead. The impact left the rider with severe head injuries, described as 'crush injuries' in the report. Police note the rider was 'ejected' and 'unconscious' at the scene. The contributing factors are listed as 'Unspecified' in the official data, and no driver errors are explicitly cited. The report confirms the rider wore a helmet but does not attribute any victim behavior as a cause.

No more big rigs clogging residential blocks. By 2025, each borough must have a site. The city must act or explain delays. Streets may breathe. Danger shifts from curbs.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0906-2023, now Local Law 142 of 2023, was enacted by the City Council on October 29, 2023, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill’s title: 'A Local Law in relation to parking for tractor trailers and other commercial trucks.' It requires the city to identify at least one feasible off-street parking location for tractor trailers in each borough by the end of 2023, and to establish those sites by December 31, 2025. No location can be on a residential street. Council Member Kamillah Hanks sponsored the bill, joined by Brannan, Riley, Dinowitz, Ung, Brooks-Powers, and others. The law aims to clear residential streets of oversized trucks, shifting their presence to designated lots. The council’s action targets the chronic hazard of trucks parked where people walk, bike, and live.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, led by HDR, will look at expanding the bridge’s narrow lanes to meet federal standards and possibly adding more lanes. The matter summary states the goal is to 'relieve congestion and improve traffic flow.' State Senator Andrew Lanza pushed for the study, calling the bridge 'very narrow therefore very dangerous.' Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton acknowledged induced demand and said the study will consider all options, including a shared-use path for cyclists and pedestrians. Former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz opposed widening, urging investment in public transit instead. The study’s outcome could shape the future safety of vulnerable road users crossing between Staten Island and New Jersey.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
