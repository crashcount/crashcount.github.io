Three seriously hurt.</strong> Four hundred sixty-three injured. These are not numbers from a war zone. They are the toll of traffic violence in Todt Hill-Emerson Hill-Lighthouse Hill-Manor Heights since 2022. The dead do not come back. The injured carry scars. In the last year alone, 148 people were hurt in 262 crashes. One lost a limb. One never made it home.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A 69-year-old man was killed by a bus on Platinum Avenue. He was crossing, not at an intersection. The bus turned left. The man died where he fell. No warning, no second chance. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> confirms the toll.</p><p>A 39-year-old man lost his leg to a truck on Sparkhill Avenue. He was working in the road. The truck slowed, but not enough. The street did not forgive.

In June 2025, Mayor Eric Adams stood in Staten Island and watched a bulldozer crush 200 illegal mopeds. He <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>said New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, because we hear it all the time, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.</a> The city links these vehicles to crime and fear, but the crackdown swept up delivery workers and even a Citi Bike. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/super-smash-nyc-destroys-mopeds-e-bikes-as-mayor-celebrates-illegal-vehicle-crackdown>said this morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them.</a></p><p>But the numbers show the main killers are still cars, trucks, and buses. The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can protect the people who walk and ride. <strong>It has not done enough.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower speed limits, redesign deadly streets, and protect the vulnerable. Demand action before another name becomes a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

High winds sent a wooden board flying from a pickup truck into David Deng’s windshield. Dashcam footage shows the board shattering glass across Deng and his family. Deng told the outlet, "I was in complete shock," and described glass covering their clothes and seats. The truck driver had stopped earlier, apparently trying to secure the load.

The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season.

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned.
