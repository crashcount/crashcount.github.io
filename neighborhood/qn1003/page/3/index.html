That’s one clock that won’t stop.</p><p>On July 12, a 13‑year‑old on an e‑bike was crushed at 163rd Ave and Cross Bay Boulevard. The SUV was stopped in traffic. The boy hit the rear and suffered crush injuries, listed as serious in city data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4827269</a>).</p><p>In April 2023, a 73‑year‑old man was struck and killed crossing North Conduit near Cohancy Street.

Lawmakers split. In June, nine city Assembly Members voted no on the renewal, including Stacey Pheffer Amato of this area (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>At City Hall in 2022, Council Member Joann Ariola opposed expanding speed cameras; her vehicle racked up dozens of violations, including school‑zone speeding and red‑light tickets, as reported then (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>Streetsblog NYC, 2022</a>).
