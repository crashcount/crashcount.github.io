Two people have died here in the last year. Over 600 have been injured since 2022. Three suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on pavement, families waiting by hospital beds, children learning to limp.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-fresh-scars>Recent Crashes, Fresh Scars</h3><p>The violence is not abstract. In the past year, a 28-year-old man was killed on Seaview Avenue—driver inattention and speed were to blame. On the Belt Parkway, a 41-year-old man died behind the wheel of a BMW SUV. The record says &ldquo;unsafe speed.&rdquo; No one walks away from that. A 17-year-old girl and a 33-year-old man were both injured at Flatlands and Vermont. The crash report reads: &ldquo;Traffic Control Disregarded. Unsafe Speed.&rdquo; The story repeats. The pain does not fade (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. In three years, they caused 60 pedestrian injuries here. Trucks and buses added seven more. Bikes injured two. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. The pattern is clear. The danger is heavy, fast, and made of steel.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-not-taken>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Not Taken</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Assembly Member Nikki Lucas and State Senator Roxanne Persaud both voted to extend school speed zones, a step that protects children (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>school speed zone extension</a>). Persaud also backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, targeting repeat reckless drivers (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>). Council Member Chris Banks co-sponsored bills for discounted bike share for seniors and students (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bike share legislation</a>).</p><p>But the carnage continues. The street does not care about discounts. It cares about speed, about steel, about who gets to walk away. Every day without a citywide 20 mph limit is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h3><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/14/woman-fatally-struck-by-genesis-g80-driver-doing-donuts-in-brooklyn-plaza-parking-lot/>said the driver</a>.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. The next name could be someone you love. The time for patience is over.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
