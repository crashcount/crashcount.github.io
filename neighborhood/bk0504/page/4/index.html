Two people have died here in the last year. Over 600 have been injured since 2022. Three suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on pavement, families waiting by hospital beds, children learning to limp.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-fresh-scars>Recent Crashes, Fresh Scars</h3><p>The violence is not abstract. In the past year, a 28-year-old man was killed on Seaview Avenue—driver inattention and speed were to blame. On the Belt Parkway, a 41-year-old man died behind the wheel of a BMW SUV. The record says &ldquo;unsafe speed.&rdquo; No one walks away from that. A 17-year-old girl and a 33-year-old man were both injured at Flatlands and Vermont. The crash report reads: &ldquo;Traffic Control Disregarded. Unsafe Speed.&rdquo; The story repeats. The pain does not fade (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. In three years, they caused 60 pedestrian injuries here. Trucks and buses added seven more. Bikes injured two. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. The pattern is clear. The danger is heavy, fast, and made of steel.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-not-taken>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Not Taken</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Assembly Member Nikki Lucas and State Senator Roxanne Persaud both voted to extend school speed zones, a step that protects children (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>school speed zone extension</a>). Persaud also backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, targeting repeat reckless drivers (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>). Council Member Chris Banks co-sponsored bills for discounted bike share for seniors and students (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bike share legislation</a>).</p><p>But the carnage continues. The street does not care about discounts. It cares about speed, about steel, about who gets to walk away. Every day without a citywide 20 mph limit is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h3><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/14/woman-fatally-struck-by-genesis-g80-driver-doing-donuts-in-brooklyn-plaza-parking-lot/>said the driver</a>.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. The next name could be someone you love. The time for patience is over.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets stay risky while data hides in shadows.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1252-2025, now laid over in the Committee on Public Safety, was introduced April 24, 2025. The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code... in relation to police department parking enforcement.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Oswald Feliz, Justin L. Brannan, Lincoln Restler, Robert F. Holden, and Chris Banks sponsor the measure. It forces NYPD to verify license plates and VINs on vehicles with temp tags or those ticketed for violations. NYPD must also publish quarterly parking enforcement reports. No safety analyst has assessed the bill's impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move targets reckless drivers. Streets stay deadly while the bill sits in committee. Pedestrians and cyclists wait for action.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0854-2025, now laid over in the Committee on Public Safety, urges passage of S.7621/A.7979. The measure calls for 'requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits.' Council Member Lincoln Restler leads, joined by nine co-sponsors including Yusef Salaam and Shahana Hanif. The bill landed in committee on April 24, 2025, with no vote yet. If passed at the state level, it would force repeat speeders to install devices that block speeding. The Council’s action highlights the ongoing risk to vulnerable road users as reckless drivers remain unchecked.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
