A truck does not stop. Four killed, one child scraped and left to watch on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Water Street</a>. A sedan on FDR Drive, a pedestrian struck, never to get up. An old man crossing Delancey, hit by an SUV turning right. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>eight dead, thirteen left with serious wounds</strong> since 2022. On the Lower East Side, the street is a wound that will not close.</p><p><strong>In the last year alone:</strong> five killed, four more with injuries that will not heal. Two of the dead were over 55. One was 25. One was 35. The city counts the bodies, but the street remembers the names.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks kill.</strong> Of the deaths and injuries to pedestrians, sedans, SUVs, taxis, and trucks do most of the work. Trucks alone took four lives. A sedan, a taxi, an SUV—each left a body behind. Motorcycles and mopeds break bones and skin, but rarely kill. Bikes are not blameless, but their toll is measured in bruises, not funerals.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. It builds some new crosswalks, lowers some speed limits. But the blood keeps coming. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed in Albany, giving the city power to set its own speed limits. The city can lower speeds to 20 mph. It has not done so everywhere. <strong>Speed cameras</strong> work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them on. Each year, the clock ticks.</p><p>The council and the mayor say the right words. But on the Lower East Side, the street is still a place where you can die for crossing at the wrong time, or for no reason at all.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark.

The race, covered April 16, 2025, highlights sharp divides. Marte opposes the City of Yes zoning reforms and calls for local exceptions to congestion pricing. Coleman backs zoning reform, more pedestrian plazas, Open Streets, and citywide trash containerization, and wants to crack down on placard parking. Lewinsohn supports platform barriers in subways and tougher e-bike and moped enforcement. Yu opposes congestion pricing and urges the MTA to focus on fare collection.

The article notes the police are investigating if officers left the scene without reporting the crash. The incident came three months after NYPD restricted car chases for low-level offenses. Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes. The fatal fire highlights the ongoing risks of police pursuits and questions the effectiveness of recent reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law orders DOT to install pavement or temporary markings within five business days after any street resurfacing. If DOT misses the deadline, it must post notices explaining the delay and set a new timeline. DOT must also report yearly on compliance.

Delays trigger public notice. The bill aims to end long stretches of torn-up streets. Broken pavement endangers walkers, cyclists, and wheelchair users. The law takes effect in 2025.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0552-2024, now Local Law 21 of 2025, was enacted by the City Council on March 15, 2025. The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with key votes on February 13, 2025. The law, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring street resurfacing coordination,' requires the Department of Transportation to coordinate with agencies and utilities and finish resurfacing within 15 business days after milling. If DOT cannot meet the deadline, it must post a public notice and alert the community board. Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The measure responds to the hazard of prolonged, uneven streets, which put pedestrians, cyclists, and people with mobility devices at risk. The law’s timeline and notice rules take effect in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A cab made a U-turn and struck her. Another car hit her moments later. She was rushed to the hospital. Both drivers stayed. She did not survive.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published February 6, 2025), Frances Rickard, 90, was crossing York Avenue at East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when a yellow taxi, driven by a 68-year-old man, made a U-turn and struck her. Police said, “Moments later, a 35-year-old woman driving a 2023 Chevrolet Trailblazer also struck her.” Rickard was taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center, where she died. Both drivers remained at the scene and have not been charged. The sequence highlights the dangers of U-turns and multi-lane crossings for pedestrians. The intersection saw two vehicles collide with a vulnerable road user in quick succession, underscoring persistent risks in city street design and driver behavior.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
