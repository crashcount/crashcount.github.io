A truck does not stop. Four killed, one child scraped and left to watch on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Water Street</a>. A sedan on FDR Drive, a pedestrian struck, never to get up. An old man crossing Delancey, hit by an SUV turning right. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>eight dead, thirteen left with serious wounds</strong> since 2022. On the Lower East Side, the street is a wound that will not close.</p><p><strong>In the last year alone:</strong> five killed, four more with injuries that will not heal. Two of the dead were over 55. One was 25. One was 35. The city counts the bodies, but the street remembers the names.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks kill.</strong> Of the deaths and injuries to pedestrians, sedans, SUVs, taxis, and trucks do most of the work. Trucks alone took four lives. A sedan, a taxi, an SUV—each left a body behind. Motorcycles and mopeds break bones and skin, but rarely kill. Bikes are not blameless, but their toll is measured in bruises, not funerals.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. It builds some new crosswalks, lowers some speed limits. But the blood keeps coming. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed in Albany, giving the city power to set its own speed limits. The city can lower speeds to 20 mph. It has not done so everywhere. <strong>Speed cameras</strong> work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them on. Each year, the clock ticks.</p><p>The council and the mayor say the right words. But on the Lower East Side, the street is still a place where you can die for crossing at the wrong time, or for no reason at all.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark.

The push, described as supporting 'an improved bike lane, pedestrian walkways, added greenery, and vehicle traffic,' has split the community. Marte and business leaders signed a letter backing the move. The NYPD briefly signaled a reopening, but City Hall called it a mistake. Mayor Adams's administration now promises to work with locals, backed by $20 million in state funds. Marte dismissed calls for extensive traffic studies, arguing Park Row is not a new road. Some residents protest the lack of public review and warn of increased danger for pedestrians and cyclists. The debate exposes a rift: business access versus street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, described as creating 'a seamless boarding experience for parents,' will allow strollers to remain open on buses, ending the need for parents to fold them before boarding. Assemblymember Grace Lee, representing District 65, voiced strong support, sharing her own struggles as a parent navigating transit with strollers. The expansion follows positive feedback and no reported safety incidents during the pilot’s first phase. The designated stroller spaces will not compromise wheelchair access, ensuring continued priority for riders with disabilities. The move marks a step toward safer, more accessible transit for families and vulnerable riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The need remains.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0965-2023 was introduced on March 16, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill required the Department of Transportation to install at least 100 miles of protected bicycle lanes annually until 2029. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of protected bicycle lanes.' Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Sandy Nurse, Erik D. Bottcher, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Shekar Krishnan, Julie Won, Chi A. Ossé, Tiffany Cabán, Christopher Marte, Crystal Hudson, and Rita C. Joseph. The bill was filed at the end of session, never enacted. The city’s protected bike lane network remains incomplete. Cyclists and other vulnerable road users still face daily risk from cars and trucks. The bill’s failure leaves the city’s most exposed travelers in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, funded by the Safe Streets and Roads for All program, will reduce traffic lanes, add protected bike paths, and improve accessibility between Clinton and Bowery Streets. The announcement follows years of crashes—38 killed or severely injured from 2016 to 2020, and 200 crashes in a decade. Council Member Carlina Rivera (District 2) was mentioned in the announcement. Council Member Christopher Marte called the road a 'crisis.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the redesign focuses on a hazardous stretch heavily used by pedestrians and cyclists. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, 'Old folks, toddlers, workers and students shouldn’t have to fear for their lives.' The grant marks a step toward safer streets for New York’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
