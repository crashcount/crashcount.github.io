A truck does not stop. Four killed, one child scraped and left to watch on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Water Street</a>. A sedan on FDR Drive, a pedestrian struck, never to get up. An old man crossing Delancey, hit by an SUV turning right. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>eight dead, thirteen left with serious wounds</strong> since 2022. On the Lower East Side, the street is a wound that will not close.</p><p><strong>In the last year alone:</strong> five killed, four more with injuries that will not heal. Two of the dead were over 55. One was 25. One was 35. The city counts the bodies, but the street remembers the names.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks kill.</strong> Of the deaths and injuries to pedestrians, sedans, SUVs, taxis, and trucks do most of the work. Trucks alone took four lives. A sedan, a taxi, an SUV—each left a body behind. Motorcycles and mopeds break bones and skin, but rarely kill. Bikes are not blameless, but their toll is measured in bruises, not funerals.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. It builds some new crosswalks, lowers some speed limits. But the blood keeps coming. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed in Albany, giving the city power to set its own speed limits. The city can lower speeds to 20 mph. It has not done so everywhere. <strong>Speed cameras</strong> work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them on. Each year, the clock ticks.</p><p>The council and the mayor say the right words. But on the Lower East Side, the street is still a place where you can die for crossing at the wrong time, or for no reason at all.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where a child can cross and come home. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill sought to "prohibit the issuance of private vehicle parking permits and revoke such existing permits," with exceptions for people with disabilities and collective bargaining agreements. Council Member Christopher Marte led as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Brewer, Joseph, Nurse, Cabán, Avilés, Bottcher, Won, Ossé, and Richardson Jordan, plus the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aimed to end a system that let private cars claim curb space, fueling illegal parking and danger for those on foot or bike. It was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. The status quo remains: permits still shield drivers, while vulnerable road users face the risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
