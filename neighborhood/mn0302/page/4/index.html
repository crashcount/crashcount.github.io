Fifteen left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In just over three years, the Lower East Side has seen 1,627 crashes. Cars, trucks, bikes, and mopeds—steel against skin. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong></p><p>A pickup truck on Water Street crushed four people on July 4, 2024. Three women and a man, all pedestrians, died where they stood. An eleven-year-old boy survived with his face torn open. No warning. No time to run. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data from NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A city worker, fixing a street sign at dawn, was slashed by a delivery cyclist after a near miss. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>said</a>.

The bill sits in committee, waiting. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council records on Legistar</a>.</p><p>Senator Kavanagh voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. The law targets the worst offenders, but the carnage continues while the process drags on. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Bill details on Open States</a>.</p><p>On Canal Street, Council Member Marte <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/09/opinion-its-time-for-immediate-action-on-canal-street>said</a>, &ldquo;The time is long overdue to take action in response to the dire conditions of Canal Street. He pledged his support to take action.&rdquo;</p><p>Political solutions must be citywide, not local gestures. New York must lower its default speed limit across the city and require speed-limiters (intelligent speed assistance) for habitual speeders. The Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045) pushes speed-limiter tech for repeat offenders; implementing citywide lower limits plus targeted speed-limiter requirements would cut kinetic force and save lives.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-waiting>The Cost of Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every delay is another body on the pavement.</strong> The city has started daylighting intersections and lowering speed limits, but the pace is glacial. The Fifth Avenue redesign cut bike and bus lanes to keep car lanes wide. &ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>said a community board leader</a>.</p><p>The dead cannot wait.</p><p>Concrete steps the city and local leaders should implement now:</p><ul><li>Install Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs) and hardened curb turns at dangerous crossings.</li><li>Expand daylighting and daylighting enforcement near crosswalks; ban curbside parking that blocks visibility.</li><li>Deploy targeted enforcement and traffic-calming on corridors with high severe-injury and truck involvement.</li></ul><p><strong>Call your council member.

The city’s system failed again.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (2025-06-07), Abdulhekim Esiyok, a 23-year-old Turkish immigrant, was killed while crossing Third Avenue after Mahbub Ali, allegedly intoxicated, drove into him. Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated. They’re still in disbelief.” The case highlights failures in both driver responsibility and alcohol-serving oversight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crackdown targets delivery workers, especially undocumented riders, for offenses like sidewalk riding and nonstandard bike setups. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the move, stating, 'When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.' Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers.

Fines become court dates. Advocates warn of escalation. Lawmakers push for e-bike registration after a fatal crash. Streets grow tense. Riders and pedestrians caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 13, 2025, that NYPD has begun issuing criminal summonses, not just traffic tickets, to cyclists and e-bike riders for violations like running red lights or riding on sidewalks. The change means accused riders must appear in criminal court, not just pay a fine. The move follows the death of Priscilla Loke, struck by an e-bike in 2023. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives call the new policy 'a dangerous escalation.' The NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance urges lawmakers to require license plates for e-bikes and scooters. The article notes, 'Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court.' The shift highlights growing tension over enforcement and the push for stricter regulation after high-profile crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
