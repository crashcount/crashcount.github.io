The bill sets fines up to $1,000 and possible jail for violators. Each offense is a misdemeanor. The council aims to strip cover for reckless drivers, making it harder to dodge tickets and accountability.

The measure was left out of the Assembly’s budget, despite support from the State Senate, Governor Hochul, Mayor Adams, and the City Council. The bill’s sponsor, Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal, did not comment. The Assembly’s move angered advocates and families, including Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets, who said, 'We are very disappointed that the Assembly didn’t follow suit.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called the decision a failure to join 'more than 130 unions, hospitals, business leaders, and community-led organizations that recognize the urgent need for this common-sense legislation.' The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. A rally is planned to push for the bill’s passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would increase the penalty to $100 for a second offense within a year and require towing after three violations in 12 months. Assembly Member Tony Simone submitted a state bill to double fines after the tenth violation, up to five times the current cap. The matter targets 'the worst repeat offenders of parking tickets.' Manhattan safe streets activist Jehiah Czebotar analyzed city data, finding that 77 percent of street-sweeping tickets go to repeat offenders, with 37 percent to drivers who got at least six tickets. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired last year, leaving a gap in enforcement.
