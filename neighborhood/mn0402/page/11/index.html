DMV data show ZIP codes with many deliveristas now lead in registered mopeds. The article quotes workers like Junior Pichardo, who says, 'If you have plates, [the police] won’t summons you.' Eric Macario and William Medina, both delivery workers, highlight confusion and lack of information about registration and insurance. Medina blames sellers for failing to inform buyers. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores have introduced a bill to require sellers to register mopeds before sale, but it remains pending. For now, advocates help workers navigate the system. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project says many only learn the rules after police seize their mopeds or issue tickets.

The bill, heard in committee, would require cruise ships at city terminals to connect to electric shore power or be barred from docking. The matter summary states: 'Fossil fuel-emitting cruise ships would have to walk the plank and abandon New York City ports unless they plug into clean shore power for energy.' Avilés, at the hearing, said, 'The Red Hook community has not seen economic benefit from this or any other cruise deal—we have seen a negative benefit, and that is traffic, unwieldy, businesses closing because workers can’t get there, honking, car crashes.' The bill also demands traffic mitigation plans for cruise departures. Residents and advocates say the city’s cruise terminals bring only pollution, congestion, and risk to vulnerable road users. The bill aims to force action where voluntary promises have failed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers breathe dirty air and dodge danger.</p><p class=mb3>Intro. 4 of 2024, sponsored by Councilmember Alexa Avilés (District 38), was introduced on February 18, 2024, and discussed in an oversight hearing. The bill, titled 'Plug it in! NYC lawmakers want diesel-powered cruise ships to connect to shore power or leave,' would force cruise ships at Red Hook and Hell’s Kitchen terminals to connect to the electric grid or be barred from docking. Avilés said, 'The Red Hook community has not seen economic benefit from this or any other cruise deal—we have seen a negative benefit, and that is traffic, unwieldy, businesses closing because workers can’t get there, honking, car crashes.' The bill targets both air pollution and the surge of car and truck traffic that endangers pedestrians and cyclists. Despite a 2017 shore power upgrade in Brooklyn, most ships still idle, spewing diesel. The Economic Development Corporation promises improvements, but locals and Avilés say the city moves too slow, putting residents at risk while cruise companies rake in profits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure aims to close loopholes and cut illegal, dangerous riding.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0024-2024 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 8, 2024, it urges Albany to pass A.8052 and S.7703. The resolution calls for 'purchasers of limited use motorcycles present a driver’s license appropriate for the legal operation... and register such limited use motorcycles, prior to completing a purchase.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer leads, joined by Rivera, Schulman, Krishnan, Won, Bottcher, and others. The bills would require dealers to check licenses and register mopeds at sale. The Council notes that illegal, unregistered mopeds endanger pedestrians, cyclists, and riders. NYPD seized over 8,600 illegal mopeds by September 2023. The resolution presses for safeguards to keep unlicensed, unregistered vehicles off city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
