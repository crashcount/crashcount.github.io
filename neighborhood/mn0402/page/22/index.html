Council Member Erik Bottcher pressed Strauber, citing resident complaints about fake placards and blocked curbs. Bottcher said, 'NYPD traffic enforcement agents are not issuing tickets to many people using counterfeit placards.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the lack of a digital placard system and is drafting new enforcement legislation. Local Law 6 mandates weekly sweeps and monthly reports, but agencies have failed to comply. The Adams administration has not advanced citizen enforcement.

The Department of Investigation (DOI) was to review and report by September 30, 2020. Agencies missed deadlines, citing pandemic and staffing shortages.

The hearing highlighted the matter: 'Standing still zone: Two-year-old parking placard abuse probe stuck in bureaucratic time warp, NYC investigator blames COVID.' Advocates and @placardabuse called the delays corrupt and dangerous. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said placard abuse is no victimless crime, making streets more dangerous and slowing buses.

Council Members Gale A. Brewer (primary), Justin L. Brannan, Erik D. Bottcher, Kalman Yeger, and Lincoln Restler sponsored the measure. The bill sought to codify an existing city rule (34 RCNY 4-12(j)), making it illegal to operate, stand, or park vehicles for commercial advertising. Violators would face a $500 penalty. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

Bottcher wants action now.</p><p class=mb3>On February 3, 2022, Manhattan Council Member Erik Bottcher demanded urgent safety upgrades for 10th and 11th Avenues. The matter, titled 'Manhattan Council Member Demands Safety Improvements on 10th and 11th Aves,' highlights the lack of protection for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders. Bottcher, speaking before DOT and backed by advocates and community boards, described the avenues as 'four-lane highways' with no safe infrastructure. He called for protected bike lanes, pedestrian refuge islands, and strict enforcement against illegal parking in loading zones. Bottcher shared his own near-miss while biking, saying, 'I was inches from the wheels of an 18-wheel truck.' DOT acknowledged his push and promised to prioritize safety. Bottcher stressed the need for resources to fix dangerous intersections and pressed the city to act before more lives are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
