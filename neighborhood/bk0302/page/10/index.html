In this region, SUVs alone have taken three lives and caused 71 moderate injuries. Trucks and buses have left two people with serious wounds. Bikes and mopeds break bones and skin, but it is the weight of steel that crushes and ends lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are the 32-year-old woman run down after a minor crash. The 68-year-old woman struck while crossing with the signal. The 26-year-old moped rider, ejected and killed. Each one is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They pass laws. They call for lower speed limits. But the blood dries before the ink. &ldquo;We will not rest until it’s over and we get justice for Tiffany,&rdquo; her family says (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/18/us-news/driver-who-mowed-down-mom-to-be-on-way-home-from-beyonce-show-nabbed-in-nyc-officials/>New York Post</a>).</p><p>Sammy’s Law gives the city power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. The city can act. It has not acted fast enough. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany must renew the law or the cameras go dark. Every delay is another risk, another family waiting for a call in the night.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is preventable. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets where no one has to bury their child.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to towing vehicles that are an encumbrance on the street.' It requires the Department of Sanitation to remove vehicles blocking the street within 72 hours of notice. The NYPD must tow cars with missing, obscured, or improper plates and stickers. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Salamanca, Brannan, Feliz, Ayala, Louis, Brewer, Avilés, Mealy, Ung, Restler, Farías, Hudson, Riley, and Schulman.

Council Member Rita Joseph, representing Flatbush and Midwood, introduced legislation to speed up construction, stating, “My community has been asking for it. The Commissioner has made a commitment. He needs to step up and do it now.” Council Member Chi Ossé condemned the administration’s inaction, calling it “yet another glaring example” of broken promises. Advocates and residents cite safety and equity concerns, noting these districts suffer more cyclist injuries and deaths but get fewer protected lanes.

The matter was discussed with Community Boards 3 and 8, and local officials, schools, and businesses support the project. Council Member Lincoln Restler accused Mayor Adams of putting politics over public safety, saying, 'Mayor Adams has decided that he cares more about who he thinks is going to vote for him in 2025 than our lives.' The delay leaves cyclists exposed to ongoing danger, with injuries on the rise. The DOT’s call for more 'community engagement' is seen as a smokescreen for inaction.

The measure aims to track these vehicles, but its impact on vulnerable road users remains unassessed.
