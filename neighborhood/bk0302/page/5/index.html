In this region, SUVs alone have taken three lives and caused 71 moderate injuries. Trucks and buses have left two people with serious wounds. Bikes and mopeds break bones and skin, but it is the weight of steel that crushes and ends lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are the 32-year-old woman run down after a minor crash. The 68-year-old woman struck while crossing with the signal. The 26-year-old moped rider, ejected and killed. Each one is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They pass laws. They call for lower speed limits. But the blood dries before the ink. &ldquo;We will not rest until it’s over and we get justice for Tiffany,&rdquo; her family says (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/18/us-news/driver-who-mowed-down-mom-to-be-on-way-home-from-beyonce-show-nabbed-in-nyc-officials/>New York Post</a>).</p><p>Sammy’s Law gives the city power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. The city can act. It has not acted fast enough. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany must renew the law or the cameras go dark. Every delay is another risk, another family waiting for a call in the night.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is preventable. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets where no one has to bury their child.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring registration of certain bicycles with electric assist,' drew sharp criticism. Ossé cited fears of increased police enforcement and harm to immigrant communities: 'The hearing demonstrated concerns about the bill to be right: Beyond its sweeping consequences for green transit and healthy urbanism, Intro 606 could spell disaster for immigrant communities.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the bill, stating it would burden delivery workers and lacks evidence for improving safety. Civil rights groups warned of racial bias and criminalization. Despite withdrawals, 29 council members still co-sponsor the bill.
