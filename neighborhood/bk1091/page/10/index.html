A truck kept going. The boy was hit in the leg. His mother too. The street was 14th Avenue. The date was January 22, 2024. They were both left standing, hurt but alive. The truck did not stop for them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>In Dyker Beach Park, no one has died in a crash since 2022. But the wounds keep coming. Fifty-seven people have been injured in 73 crashes since 2022. Eleven of them were children. Not one serious injury. Not one death. But the numbers do not tell the pain. A bruise on a child’s knee. A whiplash that lingers. A grandmother clutching her chest after a crash. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>injury records</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit-us>The Machines That Hit Us</h3><p>Cars and trucks cause the harm. In the last three years, trucks injured two people walking. Cars and SUVs did the rest. No bikes. No mopeds. No motorcycles.

No headlines. No urgency. Local leaders have not made Dyker Beach Park a focus. The city passed Sammy’s Law, giving itself the power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is still high. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The city says it is redesigning streets, but the crosswalk where the boy was hit looks the same. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who allow speed, who allow wide roads, who allow trucks to barrel through crosswalks. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets built for people, not for cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p><p>Do not wait for a death.

Tickets soared 70 percent in three weeks. Most violations hit at night and weekends—times once uncovered. Officials say the surge proves drivers speed when unchecked. The city claims this crackdown will save lives.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2022, New York City activated speed cameras 24/7 after a legislative deal in Albany. In the first three weeks, cameras issued 513,777 tickets—70 percent more than before. The bill, championed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, removed harsher penalties but kept round-the-clock enforcement. The matter summary states, 'speed safety cameras are working as they should—catching more speeding drivers and combatting reckless driving.' Council members and advocates, including Elizabeth Adams and Jehiah Czebotar, backed the move. They point to data showing most extra tickets came at night and weekends, exposing a hidden threat to pedestrians and cyclists.

The measure passed 51-12 and now moves to the Assembly. The bill allows cameras to operate 24/7 in nearly 2,000 locations across 750 school zones until July 1, 2025. The matter summary states, 'The proposal to extend New York City's speed camera program for another three years and expand it to run every day and around the clock easily passed.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored the bill, saying, 'We are going to see a marked reduction in traffic violence on our streets at a time when traffic deaths are at their highest in a decade.' Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams. Some penalties for repeat speeders were removed during negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Robert Jackson and Gounardes defending it: 'Cars speeding in New York kill New Yorkers, injure New Yorkers.' Gounardes called the cameras 'life-saving.' Opponents, including Sen. Andrew Lanza, dismissed the program as a 'cash register.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives said, 'When New York City’s speed safety cameras turn off, speeding increases and crashes rise.'

Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers urged action, saying, 'We must use all the tools at our disposal.' Council Members Joan Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and David Carr opposed, calling cameras a financial burden. Eric Dinowitz defended the program: 'If you don't want a speeding ticket, don't speed.'

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick, originally included tougher measures: escalating fines, registration suspensions, and insurance reporting for repeat speeders. These provisions were stripped during negotiations, leaving only the round-the-clock camera operation. Assembly Member Glick said, 'keeping the cameras on 24/7 was that hill.' Mayor Eric Adams called it 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives.' Advocacy groups and lawmakers voiced frustration at Albany’s reluctance to adopt stronger safety tools. The final law removes blackout periods for cameras, but leaves dangerous drivers with fewer consequences. The bill passed despite disappointment over its dilution, exposing the limits of legislative action for street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, awaiting City Council and state approval, aims to keep cameras running nights and weekends—when 41% of crashes occur. The matter summary states: 'the Legislature is poised to do the right thing and allow the speed cameras...to keep operating around the clock.' Gounardes, a key advocate, joins Mayor Adams and crash victims’ families in support. The endorsement highlights that automated enforcement cuts reckless driving and reduces injuries. The deal falls short by lacking escalating penalties for repeat speeders and lasting only three years. Still, keeping cameras on at all hours is the most important fix, targeting the deadliest times for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
