A truck kept going. The boy was hit in the leg. His mother too. The street was 14th Avenue. The date was January 22, 2024. They were both left standing, hurt but alive. The truck did not stop for them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>In Dyker Beach Park, no one has died in a crash since 2022. But the wounds keep coming. Fifty-seven people have been injured in 73 crashes since 2022. Eleven of them were children. Not one serious injury. Not one death. But the numbers do not tell the pain. A bruise on a child’s knee. A whiplash that lingers. A grandmother clutching her chest after a crash. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>injury records</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit-us>The Machines That Hit Us</h3><p>Cars and trucks cause the harm. In the last three years, trucks injured two people walking. Cars and SUVs did the rest. No bikes. No mopeds. No motorcycles.

No headlines. No urgency. Local leaders have not made Dyker Beach Park a focus. The city passed Sammy’s Law, giving itself the power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is still high. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The city says it is redesigning streets, but the crosswalk where the boy was hit looks the same. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who allow speed, who allow wide roads, who allow trucks to barrel through crosswalks. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets built for people, not for cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p><p>Do not wait for a death.

The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management.

The issue, reported by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, surfaced after riders complained of waits as long as 16 minutes. The MTA had announced service upgrades, but later changed its press release, citing F line track work as the cause for delay—work unrelated to the R train. Gounardes, who fought for MTA funding in Albany, accused the agency of misrepresenting the improvements, saying, 'I’m shocked and frustrated that the MTA would misrepresent these service upgrades to the riding public.' Transit advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance echoed calls for honesty: 'Public transit shouldn’t be a rollercoaster of mismatched expectations.'

This stretch of Atlantic Avenue is notorious for deadly crashes. Council Member Lincoln Restler responded, stating, “Our community is unified in demanding immediate changes to dramatically slow down traffic, improve safety at intersections, and install new mid block crossings.” The incident marks the second fatal crash on this corridor in 2023. Despite calls from Restler and other local officials for mid-block crossings and traffic calming after previous deaths, the city has not acted. The bill or action is a public statement, not legislation, but it highlights urgent demands for redesign and enforcement to protect vulnerable road users. No safety improvements have been implemented yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent.
