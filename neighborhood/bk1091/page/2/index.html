A truck kept going. The boy was hit in the leg. His mother too. The street was 14th Avenue. The date was January 22, 2024. They were both left standing, hurt but alive. The truck did not stop for them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>In Dyker Beach Park, no one has died in a crash since 2022. But the wounds keep coming. Fifty-seven people have been injured in 73 crashes since 2022. Eleven of them were children. Not one serious injury. Not one death. But the numbers do not tell the pain. A bruise on a child’s knee. A whiplash that lingers. A grandmother clutching her chest after a crash. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>injury records</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit-us>The Machines That Hit Us</h3><p>Cars and trucks cause the harm. In the last three years, trucks injured two people walking. Cars and SUVs did the rest. No bikes. No mopeds. No motorcycles.

No headlines. No urgency. Local leaders have not made Dyker Beach Park a focus. The city passed Sammy’s Law, giving itself the power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is still high. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The city says it is redesigning streets, but the crosswalk where the boy was hit looks the same. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who allow speed, who allow wide roads, who allow trucks to barrel through crosswalks. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets built for people, not for cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p><p>Do not wait for a death.

The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked.

MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031.

The bill, now pending, would let courts require drivers with six or more automated speeding tickets in a year to install speed limiter devices. Salaam’s resolution, co-sponsored by five council members, urges Albany to act. The matter title: 'Council Member Yusef Salaam Throws Support Behind Albany Push To Rein In Speeding Drivers.' Salaam said, 'It's very simple: it's to save lives.' The hearing drew families of crash victims and advocates like Amy Cohen and Darnell Sealy-McCrorey, who lost loved ones to reckless drivers.

Gonzalez criticized New York’s laws, saying, 'The law is very restrictive in allowing district attorney’s to pursue murder charges in these types of cases.' He noted Yarimi’s 21 speeding and five red-light tickets did not trigger license points or insurance penalties. Gonzalez questioned why the NYPD cannot seize cars based on repeated violations and called for legislative change. He endorsed State Sen. Andrew Gounardes’s bill (S7621), which would require speed limiter technology for drivers with six or more automated enforcement tickets in a year, describing it as a way to fight 'violent car culture.' Gonzalez urged lawmakers to make it easier to prosecute and prevent reckless driving, centering the deadly risk to families and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
