A truck kept going. The boy was hit in the leg. His mother too. The street was 14th Avenue. The date was January 22, 2024. They were both left standing, hurt but alive. The truck did not stop for them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>In Dyker Beach Park, no one has died in a crash since 2022. But the wounds keep coming. Fifty-seven people have been injured in 73 crashes since 2022. Eleven of them were children. Not one serious injury. Not one death. But the numbers do not tell the pain. A bruise on a child’s knee. A whiplash that lingers. A grandmother clutching her chest after a crash. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>injury records</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit-us>The Machines That Hit Us</h3><p>Cars and trucks cause the harm. In the last three years, trucks injured two people walking. Cars and SUVs did the rest. No bikes. No mopeds. No motorcycles.

No headlines. No urgency. Local leaders have not made Dyker Beach Park a focus. The city passed Sammy’s Law, giving itself the power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is still high. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The city says it is redesigning streets, but the crosswalk where the boy was hit looks the same. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who allow speed, who allow wide roads, who allow trucks to barrel through crosswalks. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets built for people, not for cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p><p>Do not wait for a death.

The debate included calls for audits and cost reductions from Rep. Mike Lawler, while MTA Chair Janno Lieber promised to prioritize repairs over expansion. The committee has not yet voted.

Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, 'Three people were injured, including an MTA bus driver and a young girl, in a collision that pinned two cars between a box truck and a city bus.' Footage showed two vehicles sandwiched between the bus and truck, with one car stacked atop another. The injured included a 59-year-old MTA driver, a 33-year-old woman, and a 9-year-old girl. All were hospitalized in stable condition. The cause of the crash was not determined at the time of reporting.

The Zoning Subcommittee, chaired by Council Member Kevin Riley, exempted single-family districts from new transit-oriented development rules. The matter summary reads: 'Urban Banning: Single-Family Districts Exempted from Transit-Oriented Development.' Council Members David Carr and Kamillah Hanks of Staten Island voted against the modified plan, defending suburban-style zoning. Riley argued, 'One-family zoned districts represent less than 15 percent of the city's land area... they are valuable.' The exemption means fewer apartments near transit, locking in car dependence. Moses Gates of the Regional Plan Association called the move senseless from a planning perspective. Lawmakers in affected neighborhoods hailed the change, but advocates warn it blocks safer, less car-centric housing near transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, a policy proposal to adjust congestion pricing, comes as officials rush to implement it before a new presidential administration can intervene. The original $15 toll, crafted by the Traffic Mobility Review Board and approved by the MTA Board, promised strong traffic reduction and included credits and caps. The $9 version, previously reviewed in environmental assessments, may lack those protections. Economist Charles Komanoff warns, 'You lose other benefits. Most noticeably, you don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes urges swift action, saying, 'The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now.' The lower toll is projected to improve traffic speeds by only 6.4 percent, far less than the 17 percent expected from the original plan.
