A truck kept going. The boy was hit in the leg. His mother too. The street was 14th Avenue. The date was January 22, 2024. They were both left standing, hurt but alive. The truck did not stop for them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>In Dyker Beach Park, no one has died in a crash since 2022. But the wounds keep coming. Fifty-seven people have been injured in 73 crashes since 2022. Eleven of them were children. Not one serious injury. Not one death. But the numbers do not tell the pain. A bruise on a child’s knee. A whiplash that lingers. A grandmother clutching her chest after a crash. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>injury records</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit-us>The Machines That Hit Us</h3><p>Cars and trucks cause the harm. In the last three years, trucks injured two people walking. Cars and SUVs did the rest. No bikes. No mopeds. No motorcycles. The danger is heavy and fast and made of steel. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>vehicle data</a></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>No deaths. No headlines. No urgency. Local leaders have not made Dyker Beach Park a focus. The city passed Sammy’s Law, giving itself the power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is still high. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The city says it is redesigning streets, but the crosswalk where the boy was hit looks the same. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who allow speed, who allow wide roads, who allow trucks to barrel through crosswalks. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets built for people, not for cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p><p>Do not wait for a death.

The driver did not slow down. The victim flew through the air. He died at the hospital. The driver fled. Senator Gounardes called for prosecution and safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2024, State Senator Andrew Gounardes (District 26) responded to a fatal hit-and-run in Bay Ridge. Surveillance video shows a white SUV slamming into Segundo Reina-Gaon, 74, at Ridge Boulevard and Bay Ridge Avenue. The driver did not slow down and fled the scene. Gounardes wrote, 'Awful news to wake up to this morning in Bay Ridge. The video is hard to watch. The driver doesn’t appear to even slow down. This driver needs to be apprehended and prosecuted. And we will continue to work with DOT to make this intersection – and Ridge Boulevard – safer.' Gounardes supports stronger enforcement and street redesign to protect pedestrians.

The letter, organized by Local Progress, states: 'This means projects that expanded cycling infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, and public transit were prioritized over outdated highway expansions and lane widening.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill. Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.' The bill would force planners to consider car miles in every project, shifting focus from car movement to safer, people-first streets. The policy could help undo decades of harm from highways that split communities and reinforce segregation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Kathy Hochul publicly supported reauthorizing New York City’s red light camera program, which is set to expire in December. The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, would renew the program for six years and expand cameras from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Hochul, at a ceremony for 'Sammy’s Law,' said, 'local governments should be making these decisions,' but did not endorse the expansion. The Adams administration and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez have pushed for more cameras. Hochul’s stance signals support for local control over traffic enforcement, but leaves the fate of a broader camera rollout uncertain. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while Albany debates the city’s authority to protect its streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The loophole leaves reckless drivers free to kill.</p><p class=mb3>Queens Senator Michael Gianaris, with Assemblymember William Magnarelli, introduced a bill to suspend vehicle registrations after five speed or red light camera violations in one year. The measure remains in committee. The bill responds to a fatal flaw: 'We have no mechanism right now, under law, to crack down on extremely reckless drivers,' said Brooklyn State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The current law lets drivers rack up dozens of camera tickets and keep driving, since no points are added to licenses. Gianaris’s bill aims to close this loophole. DOT and crash victims’ families, including Juliane Williams, whose daughter was killed by a speeding driver, press for stronger penalties and expansion of the red light camera program. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired with little effect. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while repeat offenders face few real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
