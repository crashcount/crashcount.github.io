A bus does not stop. On Madison Street, a child is struck. On Canal, a cyclist is thrown. The numbers pile up: <strong>421 injuries, 5 serious injuries, 1 death</strong> in Chinatown-Two Bridges since 2022, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. No one calls it an accident when it happens this often. The street does not care if you are young or old. In the last year, <strong>eight children were hurt</strong>. One person died. The dead do not speak. Their absence is a wound that does not close.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs hit hardest.</strong> Sedans and SUVs caused 23 moderate injuries. Trucks and buses, five more. Bikes—often blamed, rarely protected—were involved in six cases, including the only death. A 69-year-old woman was killed by an e-bike at Grand and Chrystie. She died days later, her head struck, her family left to wait for justice that never came. The District Attorney said there was not enough evidence to prosecute the rider. The city moved on. The family did not.

Riders must appear in criminal court. The city calls it safety. Advocates call it escalation. The push for license plates on e-bikes grows, but the streets remain the same. No new protected lanes. No new daylighting. The most vulnerable are still left to fend for themselves. Leadership claims progress, but the numbers do not lie. The blood dries, but the danger does not fade. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>West Side Spirit covered the escalation</a>.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. <strong>Call your council member. Demand slower speeds, safer crossings, real protection for people walking and biking.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.

The city must do more.</p><p class=mb3>On April 11, 2022, Councilman Christopher Marte (District 1) joined CUNY students and transit advocates at a public rally outside City Hall. The event targeted New York City’s sluggish bus service and the high cost of MTA fares. The rally demanded Mayor Adams speed up bus commutes, install at least 30 miles of new bus lanes in 2022, and expand the Fair Fares program for low-income riders. Marte declared, 'It shouldn't just be a vote to get 30 miles of additional bus lanes. That should be the minimum.' The rally pressed the city to prioritize bus lanes, bike lanes, and pedestrian-oriented streets, echoing the Streets Master Plan. No formal bill was under consideration, but the council and advocates pushed for $3.1 billion in funding for these changes. The action highlights the urgent need for safer, faster, and more affordable transit for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation and Council Member Chris Marte faced residents at a design workshop. The matter: 'What is to be done about traffic and safety on Canal Street?' Marte pledged support for urgent changes. The op-ed notes that pedestrians are 65% of users but get as little as 10% of street space. Residents demand widened sidewalks, protected bike lanes, and enforcement against double-parking and crosswalk invasions. The call is clear: shift space from cars to people. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at daily risk. The time for talk is over. The street must change now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, still in early stages, aims to ban advertising of rapid delivery times. The matter summary reads: 'ban apps from advertising quick delivery times, arguing they encourage delivery workers to break traffic laws and endanger themselves and pedestrians.' Brewer also pressed for enforcement against 'dark stores' operating in retail zones. She criticized Gorillas' changes as cosmetic, saying, 'They're doing this just to conform [to zoning rules] but it's not really their model.' Councilman Christopher Marte is leading the bill. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the council’s focus is clear: speed kills, and zoning violations breed chaos.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to cut the deadly rush.</p><p class=mb3>On February 21, 2022, Councilman Christopher Marte introduced a bill in the New York City Council to ban on-demand grocery apps from advertising 15-minute delivery times. The bill, not yet assigned a committee or vote date, responds to the rise of companies like Gorillas and Getir. The matter summary states the bill 'would bar on-demand grocery apps from advertising 15-minute delivery times, citing threats to worker and pedestrian safety.' Marte, representing District 1, argues that these ads pressure delivery workers on e-bikes and scooters to break traffic laws, endangering themselves and pedestrians. 'We don’t think that should be legal,' Marte said. He believes giving workers more time will save lives by reducing the rush. The bill is part of a broader push for delivery worker protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
