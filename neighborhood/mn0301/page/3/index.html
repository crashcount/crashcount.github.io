The street is still dangerous.</p><p>Every day without change is another day someone pays the price.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p>Demand more. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Policy shifts, but questions remain on safety and congestion.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (June 14, 2025), City Hall approved a plan to ban cars on 34th Street between 3rd and 9th Avenues, creating a dedicated busway. The article details heated opposition from local residents and bus riders, who argued the plan was rushed and lacked proper traffic analysis. Stacy Rauch, a daily bus rider, said, 'The bigger problem is we don’t have enough buses.' Critics worried diverted car traffic would overwhelm nearby streets. The city compared the move to the 14th Street car ban, but residents noted differences in bus frequency. The article highlights accusations of conflicts of interest involving community board members and advocacy groups. The policy aims to prioritize buses and vulnerable road users, but leaves open questions about implementation and neighborhood impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
