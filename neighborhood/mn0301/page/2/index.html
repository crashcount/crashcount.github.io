A bus does not stop. On Madison Street, a child is struck. On Canal, a cyclist is thrown. The numbers pile up: <strong>421 injuries, 5 serious injuries, 1 death</strong> in Chinatown-Two Bridges since 2022, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. No one calls it an accident when it happens this often. The street does not care if you are young or old. In the last year, <strong>eight children were hurt</strong>. One person died. The dead do not speak. Their absence is a wound that does not close.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs hit hardest.</strong> Sedans and SUVs caused 23 moderate injuries. Trucks and buses, five more. Bikes—often blamed, rarely protected—were involved in six cases, including the only death. A 69-year-old woman was killed by an e-bike at Grand and Chrystie. She died days later, her head struck, her family left to wait for justice that never came. The District Attorney said there was not enough evidence to prosecute the rider. The city moved on. The family did not. As <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>West Side Spirit reported</a>: &ldquo;She died from a traumatic head injury several days after being hit; the District Attorney said there was insufficient evidence to criminally prosecute the e-biker who hit her.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>NYPD now writes criminal summonses to cyclists</strong>—not just tickets. Riders must appear in criminal court. The city calls it safety. Advocates call it escalation. The push for license plates on e-bikes grows, but the streets remain the same. No new protected lanes. No new daylighting. The most vulnerable are still left to fend for themselves. Leadership claims progress, but the numbers do not lie. The blood dries, but the danger does not fade. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>West Side Spirit covered the escalation</a>.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. <strong>Call your council member. Demand slower speeds, safer crossings, real protection for people walking and biking.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not wait for you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
