Three suffered injuries so severe the word &lsquo;serious&rsquo; barely covers it. A nine-year-old boy, struck by a moped, left with a head wound and shock. A 77-year-old woman, crushed by an SUV, unconscious at the scene. These are not numbers.

Mopeds and motorcycles are not far behind. In the last three years, not a single bike caused a death or serious injury here. The danger comes on four wheels, sometimes two, but never from a pedal.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city touts its record: new intersection redesigns, more space for people on foot, and the power to lower speed limits. <strong>Sammy’s Law now lets New York City drop residential speed limits to 20 mph</strong>. But the law sits unused. The limit is not lowered. The danger remains. Speed cameras work, but their future is uncertain. The law that keeps them running is set to expire. Albany and City Hall hold the keys, but the doors stay shut.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No death is luck. No injury is fate.</strong> These wounds are preventable. The city can act. The council can vote. The mayor can sign. Residents can call, write, and demand. <strong>Do not wait for the first death.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The pilot, part of the 'Charge Safe Ride Safe Action Plan,' opened its first station in Cooper Square. The program, highlighted by Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33), offers 102 charging points for 100 delivery workers, many of them immigrants, at no cost. Three companies—Swobbee, Popwheels, and Swiftmile—operate the FDNY-reviewed stations. The official summary states the pilot 'aims to improve the safety of recharging lithium-ion batteries and counter the demonization of e-bikes.' Mayor Adams said, 'This pilot program ... will give delivery workers the ability to access safe, accessible, outdoor battery-charging that will undoubtedly save lives.' The city faces delays and pushback on e-bike infrastructure, with faster progress for electric cars.

The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility.

DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks. Leaders want more: curb extensions, redesigned crossings, and further traffic calming. Atlantic Avenue remains a battleground for the city’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes.

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not tied to a specific bill number, was led by the Department of Transportation and praised by Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33). The redesign turned a congested, two-way street into a one-way westbound corridor with two directions of physically-separated, dedicated bus lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the project 'transformed what was a congested, double-parked corridor into two-way fully protected and dedicated bus lanes.' Restler declared, 'Those days are over with the new Livingston Busway!' The project aims to speed up service for 50,000 daily riders and keep cars out of bus lanes with concrete boarding islands.

The DOT described the meeting as a chance to 'help craft a proposal' and denied any plan to eliminate all parking. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We wanted to start here, in this pilot project, listening from the community on how we reimagine the community.' Residents, spurred by misinformation, confronted officials and voiced fears over losing parking. Some, like Andy Rosenthal, supported loading zones. Others, like activist Andrew Fine, rejected the process outright. The meeting highlighted deep divides over curb use, but also the urgent need to address double parking and blocked bike lanes that endanger pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article documents rampant illegal parking in painted daylighting zones, often by city vehicles.
