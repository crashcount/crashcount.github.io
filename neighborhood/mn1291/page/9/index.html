Three suffered injuries so severe the word &lsquo;serious&rsquo; barely covers it. A nine-year-old boy, struck by a moped, left with a head wound and shock. A 77-year-old woman, crushed by an SUV, unconscious at the scene. These are not numbers.

Mopeds and motorcycles are not far behind. In the last three years, not a single bike caused a death or serious injury here. The danger comes on four wheels, sometimes two, but never from a pedal.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city touts its record: new intersection redesigns, more space for people on foot, and the power to lower speed limits. <strong>Sammy’s Law now lets New York City drop residential speed limits to 20 mph</strong>. But the law sits unused. The limit is not lowered. The danger remains. Speed cameras work, but their future is uncertain. The law that keeps them running is set to expire. Albany and City Hall hold the keys, but the doors stay shut.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No death is luck. No injury is fate.</strong> These wounds are preventable. The city can act. The council can vote. The mayor can sign. Residents can call, write, and demand. <strong>Do not wait for the first death.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Now, longer cargo bikes roll legal. Four-wheelers, capped at 15 mph, can haul freight. Trucks choke streets and kill. Cargo bikes offer a safer, cleaner way. Industry pushed. DOT listened. Streets change. Pedestrians and cyclists breathe easier.</p><p class=mb3>On March 27, 2024, the NYC Department of Transportation finalized new cargo bike rules after months of industry pushback. The rules, shaped by public comment, allow pedal-assist cargo bikes up to four feet wide and 192 inches long, with four wheels, and set a 15 mph speed cap. The original proposal would have banned most existing cargo bike-trailer setups with a 120-inch limit. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez promised to get it right. Mark Chiusano, CEO of Net Zero Logistics, praised the fix: "They did a really good job of fixing the original version and made good on their word." Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi said, "We are accommodating this change in consumer culture—encouraging environmental package delivery, away from cars and trucks." Ben Morris of Coaster Cycles warned the old cap would have wiped out the market. DOT's move aims to cut truck traffic, which causes 12% of pedestrian and 30% of cyclist deaths. The new rules create a legal path for safer, greener freight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Victims’ families demand action. Cameras cut crashes. But the most dangerous drivers remain loose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2024, the Department of Transportation released a report urging passage of a bill to expand New York City’s red-light camera program. The bill, supported by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and sponsored by State Senator Andrew Goundardes, would boost camera coverage from 150 to 1,325 intersections—about 10% of the city’s 13,700 signals. The report states: “Expanding the number of intersections with red light cameras... could substantially enhance the deterrent effect of the program and return New York City to the consistently downward trend of red light-running behavior we had seen prior to the pandemic.” Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz also supports expansion, calling for cameras at every intersection. The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains. Relatives of crash victims joined the call, demanding the city confront driver negligence and protect the community.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced March 7, 2024, it urges Albany to pass and sign a law creating unlimited subway and bus transfers within two hours for pay-per-ride users. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation, which would create unlimited transfers within the two-hour period of paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority subway or bus fare for pay-per-ride users.'

The boards urge the city to stop exempting itself from state law requiring no parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. The resolution follows fatal crashes involving children at poorly visible corners. The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data.

Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent.

Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility.
