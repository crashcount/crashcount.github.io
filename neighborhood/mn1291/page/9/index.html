No deaths are recorded in this window (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Speed cameras work citywide.

But here, the injuries keep coming.</p><h3 id=where-it-breaks-again-and-again>Where it breaks again and again</h3><p>Harlem River Drive is a wound. It accounts for <strong>101 injuries</strong> in this area alone. Dyckman Street adds <strong>26</strong> more (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The corners on Amsterdam keep drawing blood: the left turn at Amsterdam and W 178 St hit two people at once; three nights earlier at Amsterdam and W 171 St, a sedan making a U‑turn injured a child pedestrian (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The clock tells a story too. Injuries spike at <strong>1 AM</strong> in this area, with <strong>20</strong> people hurt at that hour across the period. Dusk into night stays dangerous (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-causes-we-can-name>The causes we can name</h3><p>The records cite failures we know how to fix: failure to yield, driver inattention, unsafe speed, and drivers blowing signals. Each shows up in the local crash files, including the Amsterdam cases above (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Feb 11, 2025, just before evening, a 77‑year‑old pedestrian was left unconscious after an SUV strike along Harlem River Drive (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The list runs long. The fixes are not mysteries: daylight the corners, harden the turns, slow the cars.</p><h3 id=who-holds-the-keys>Who holds the keys</h3><p>City leaders boast of progress. “Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,” said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>BKReader</a>). Albany renewed <strong>24/7 school‑zone speed cameras</strong> through 2030 (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Those are steps. They are not the end.</p><p>The next step is on the books. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong> would force the worst repeat offenders to use speed limiters after a pattern of violations. State Senator <a href=/senate-district/31/>Robert Jackson</a> co‑sponsored the Senate bill <strong>S4045</strong> and voted yes in committee (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/72/>Manny De Los Santos</a> co‑sponsors the Assembly bill <strong>A2299</strong> (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">NY Assembly</a>). Council Member <a href=/council-district/10/>Carmen De La Rosa</a> has backed daylighting legislation to clear sightlines at crosswalks.</p><h3 id=make-these-corners-forgive>Make these corners forgive</h3><p>Amsterdam needs hardened turns and leading walk time. Dyckman needs slow speeds and clear sight lines. Harlem River Drive needs barriers and speed control. Night hours need targeted enforcement where the injuries cluster.</p><p>Citywide, two moves would help this map: a lower default speed limit on local streets and speed limiters for repeat offenders. Albany already renewed the cameras; the Legislature can pass the limiter bills now (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>Streetsblog NYC</a>; <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S4045</a>; <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>).</p><p>The two people crossing at W 178 St did what the light told them to do.

The Department of Transportation seeks a contractor to install technology that fines drivers who pass stopped buses. The state legalized these cameras in 2019. The City Council, led by then-Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez, passed a law in early 2022 for a six-month pilot and required annual reporting. The city enacted automated fine rules in November. Advocates, including Transportation Alternatives, praised the move: 'We know changes like this can save lives.' Suffolk County saw a 42-percent drop in violations after similar cameras. The Adams administration questioned the program's impact, noting no deaths from bus arm violations since 2014. The city has not published pilot results.

The official summary states: 'The addition of a parking-protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue will create a critical cycling link...while making the road safer for everyone.' Ossé, who previously criticized DOT delays, said, 'This project is a win for everyone.' The lane will address a Vision Zero Priority Corridor with five pedestrian deaths and nearly 400 crashes since 2019.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods.

The plan aims to make Park Avenue 'greener, safer and more welcoming,' but leaves out key details: 'All ideas are welcome,' Rodriguez said, refusing to commit to a protected bike lane. Rep. Jerry Nadler voiced support for sustainable transit, including Citi Bike. Advocates like Jon Orcutt highlighted the lack of bike lanes in the area, calling for urgent action. The Request for Proposals is open for four weeks to women and minority-owned firms, with public input to follow. The absence of a protected bike lane keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter, signed by outgoing NYCT President Richard Davey and interim successor Demetrius Crichlow, called the city’s paint-and-enforcement approach a 'total bust.' The MTA cited new data showing bus speeds increased just 2–4 percent since October 2022—far below the 15 percent target. The matter summary reads: 'The Fordham Road project enjoys widespread support from transit advocacy groups, and Fordham Road bus riders, who have been enduring slow service for decades.' Council involvement is not specified, but the MTA’s letter and Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein both demand stronger measures.

Only 1,300 restaurants applied for permits, compared to 12,500 during the pandemic. The City Council and Mayor Adams changed the law, allowing roadway dining only seasonally.

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, issued a 'last call' for applications. Rodriguez said, 'Outdoor dining enriches our communities, and we're excited to make it a permanent feature of New York City streets.' Yet, only 23 roadway setups are pending approval. Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans argue the city should allow year-round use, calling the decline a missed opportunity for public space and safety.

Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life.

The SUV failed to yield right-of-way, colliding with the pedestrian’s hip and upper leg. The victim suffered bruising but remained conscious and was not ejected.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred at 15:30 on 10 Avenue involving a southbound SUV and a pedestrian at an intersection. The pedestrian, a 44-year-old male, was injured with contusions to his hip and upper leg but remained conscious and was not ejected. The SUV’s center front end struck the pedestrian, causing the injuries. The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor by the driver. The pedestrian’s actions were noted as 'Other Actions in Roadway' and 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion,' but the primary fault lies with the driver’s failure to yield. The collision also involved a parked sedan, which sustained damage to its left side doors. The report highlights driver error as the key cause of the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
