No deaths are recorded in this window (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Speed cameras work citywide.

But here, the injuries keep coming.</p><h3 id=where-it-breaks-again-and-again>Where it breaks again and again</h3><p>Harlem River Drive is a wound. It accounts for <strong>101 injuries</strong> in this area alone. Dyckman Street adds <strong>26</strong> more (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The corners on Amsterdam keep drawing blood: the left turn at Amsterdam and W 178 St hit two people at once; three nights earlier at Amsterdam and W 171 St, a sedan making a U‑turn injured a child pedestrian (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The clock tells a story too. Injuries spike at <strong>1 AM</strong> in this area, with <strong>20</strong> people hurt at that hour across the period. Dusk into night stays dangerous (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-causes-we-can-name>The causes we can name</h3><p>The records cite failures we know how to fix: failure to yield, driver inattention, unsafe speed, and drivers blowing signals. Each shows up in the local crash files, including the Amsterdam cases above (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Feb 11, 2025, just before evening, a 77‑year‑old pedestrian was left unconscious after an SUV strike along Harlem River Drive (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The list runs long. The fixes are not mysteries: daylight the corners, harden the turns, slow the cars.</p><h3 id=who-holds-the-keys>Who holds the keys</h3><p>City leaders boast of progress. “Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year,” said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>BKReader</a>). Albany renewed <strong>24/7 school‑zone speed cameras</strong> through 2030 (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Those are steps. They are not the end.</p><p>The next step is on the books. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong> would force the worst repeat offenders to use speed limiters after a pattern of violations. State Senator <a href=/senate-district/31/>Robert Jackson</a> co‑sponsored the Senate bill <strong>S4045</strong> and voted yes in committee (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/72/>Manny De Los Santos</a> co‑sponsors the Assembly bill <strong>A2299</strong> (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">NY Assembly</a>). Council Member <a href=/council-district/10/>Carmen De La Rosa</a> has backed daylighting legislation to clear sightlines at crosswalks.</p><h3 id=make-these-corners-forgive>Make these corners forgive</h3><p>Amsterdam needs hardened turns and leading walk time. Dyckman needs slow speeds and clear sight lines. Harlem River Drive needs barriers and speed control. Night hours need targeted enforcement where the injuries cluster.</p><p>Citywide, two moves would help this map: a lower default speed limit on local streets and speed limiters for repeat offenders. Albany already renewed the cameras; the Legislature can pass the limiter bills now (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>Streetsblog NYC</a>; <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S4045</a>; <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>).</p><p>The two people crossing at W 178 St did what the light told them to do.

Enforcement remains a question.</p><p class=mb3>On March 22, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced a major redesign on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan, following a decade-long utility overhaul. The project, not a council bill but a city initiative, expanded pedestrian space with 'super sidewalks'—painted sidewalk extensions between 50th and 59th streets. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pledged to bring this design citywide, stating, 'While we are excited to bring this improvement to Hells Kitchen, we look forward to expanding these efforts elsewhere.' Council member Erik Bottcher called for similar changes on 10th and 11th Avenues. Local advocate Christine Berthet called the new space 'just like having air to breathe.' The redesign removed a car lane in a neighborhood where most households lack cars. Still, the use of paint over concrete means drivers, including NYPD, sometimes park illegally on pedestrian space. DOT says it will work with police to protect these 'sacred spaces.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Data expert Jehiah Czebotar noted that most vehicles caught speeding do not receive a second ticket and urged state legislators to permanently authorize automated enforcement of all traffic rules and expand red-light camera programs.

Critics say low fees fuel car ownership, crowding out transit, bikes, and green space. Experts warn it’s a subsidy for drivers, not a fix for congestion or emissions.</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2023, a Senate proposal surfaced to create a Residential Parking Permit system in New York City. The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lawmakers wrote, “Nothing can bring back Dolma Naadhun, but we can prevent further loss of life so that no family must experience the loss of a loved one.” DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed a Council bill mandating 100 daylighted intersections per year, arguing for flexibility and physical infrastructure in daylit spaces. Advocates and experts agree: daylighting without barriers is flawed. They call for curb extensions to slow drivers and protect people. Residents remain frustrated by the city’s slow, limited response after repeated deaths and injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s summary states, 'The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.' Liu, as the bill’s primary sponsor, emphasized that anyone found with a BAC over 0.05 would be charged with DWI. City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez joined the push, warning, 'Whether they are at 0.06 or 0.12 or 0.20, the consequences can be deadly.' Drunk driving caused 307 deaths in New York State in 2019, nearly a third of all fatal crashes. Utah’s adoption of a 0.05 BAC limit led to a 20% drop in fatal crashes in its first year.

The stretch has killed and maimed for years. Officials call it a crisis. The redesign aims to protect walkers and riders where drivers have struck down too many.</p><p class=mb3>On February 6, 2023, officials announced an $18 million federal grant for a street safety overhaul on Delancey Street, Manhattan. The project, funded by the Safe Streets and Roads for All program, will reduce traffic lanes, add protected bike paths, and improve accessibility between Clinton and Bowery Streets. The announcement follows years of crashes—38 killed or severely injured from 2016 to 2020, and 200 crashes in a decade. Council Member Carlina Rivera (District 2) was mentioned in the announcement. Council Member Christopher Marte called the road a 'crisis.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the redesign focuses on a hazardous stretch heavily used by pedestrians and cyclists. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, 'Old folks, toddlers, workers and students shouldn’t have to fear for their lives.' The grant marks a step toward safer streets for New York’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
