But the numbers do not let you breathe easy. In the last twelve months, 50 people were injured in 57 crashes. Seven of those hurt were children. No one was spared: young, old, working, retired. The road does not care.</p><p>The Belt Parkway keeps bleeding. A three-year-old boy was hurt in January, strapped in the back seat, his shoulder bruised. An 82-year-old woman, head snapped forward, was injured in April. A 12-year-old girl, neck wrenched, was one of three hurt in a June pileup. The list runs long. The pain is quiet, but it lingers.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>No pedestrians or cyclists died here. But the threat is always there. Most injuries came in cars and SUVs, but motorcycles and trucks are part of the story. The numbers do not show the fear in a parent’s eyes, or the cost of a missed day’s work. They do not show the child who limps to school, or the old woman who stops driving for good.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member David Carr has voted for some safety bills—like moving trucks off residential streets and requiring traffic calming near seniors. He backed a plan for a citywide greenway. But he also voted against 24/7 speed cameras—a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). He opposed daylighting at intersections, a simple fix that saves lives. He co-sponsored bills for raised speed reducers, but also backed measures that could make bike lanes less safe. The record is mixed. The danger is not.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward>The Path Forward</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every injury is a policy failure. Every crash is a call for action. Contact your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets that protect the most vulnerable.</p><p>Do not wait for a death to make it real. The slow disaster is already here.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
