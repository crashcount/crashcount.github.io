But the numbers do not let you breathe easy. In the last twelve months, 50 people were injured in 57 crashes. Seven of those hurt were children. No one was spared: young, old, working, retired. The road does not care.</p><p>The Belt Parkway keeps bleeding. A three-year-old boy was hurt in January, strapped in the back seat, his shoulder bruised. An 82-year-old woman, head snapped forward, was injured in April. A 12-year-old girl, neck wrenched, was one of three hurt in a June pileup. The list runs long. The pain is quiet, but it lingers.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>No pedestrians or cyclists died here. But the threat is always there. Most injuries came in cars and SUVs, but motorcycles and trucks are part of the story. The numbers do not show the fear in a parent’s eyes, or the cost of a missed day’s work. They do not show the child who limps to school, or the old woman who stops driving for good.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member David Carr has voted for some safety bills—like moving trucks off residential streets and requiring traffic calming near seniors. He backed a plan for a citywide greenway. But he also voted against 24/7 speed cameras—a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). He opposed daylighting at intersections, a simple fix that saves lives. He co-sponsored bills for raised speed reducers, but also backed measures that could make bike lanes less safe. The record is mixed. The danger is not.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward>The Path Forward</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every injury is a policy failure. Every crash is a call for action. Contact your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets that protect the most vulnerable.</p><p>Do not wait for a death to make it real. The slow disaster is already here.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year.

The driver, with a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' struck the family as they crossed the street. The bill would require speed-limiting technology for drivers with repeated offenses—those with 11 or more points in 24 months, or six camera tickets in a year. Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, citing the crash, demand action: 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair... it’s time for us to act.' The incident highlights gaps in enforcement and the stalled progress of safety legislation meant to curb reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
