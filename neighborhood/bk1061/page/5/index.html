But the numbers do not let you breathe easy. In the last twelve months, 50 people were injured in 57 crashes. Seven of those hurt were children. No one was spared: young, old, working, retired. The road does not care.</p><p>The Belt Parkway keeps bleeding. A three-year-old boy was hurt in January, strapped in the back seat, his shoulder bruised. An 82-year-old woman, head snapped forward, was injured in April. A 12-year-old girl, neck wrenched, was one of three hurt in a June pileup. The list runs long. The pain is quiet, but it lingers.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>No pedestrians or cyclists died here. But the threat is always there. Most injuries came in cars and SUVs, but motorcycles and trucks are part of the story. The numbers do not show the fear in a parent’s eyes, or the cost of a missed day’s work. They do not show the child who limps to school, or the old woman who stops driving for good.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member David Carr has voted for some safety bills—like moving trucks off residential streets and requiring traffic calming near seniors. He backed a plan for a citywide greenway. But he also voted against 24/7 speed cameras—a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). He opposed daylighting at intersections, a simple fix that saves lives. He co-sponsored bills for raised speed reducers, but also backed measures that could make bike lanes less safe. The record is mixed. The danger is not.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward>The Path Forward</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every injury is a policy failure. Every crash is a call for action. Contact your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets that protect the most vulnerable.</p><p>Do not wait for a death to make it real. The slow disaster is already here.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Deputy Chief Michael Pilecki told the committee, 'Any vehicle bearing one of these fraudulent plates instantly becomes undetectable to nearly every aspect of street level enforcement.' Council Member David Carr (District 50) offered Staten Island tow pound space to help the NYPD, which faces a shortage after the Manhattan pound closed. The NYPD reported towing is up 192% for covered plates, but limited storage stalls progress.

The vote backs millions who depend on buses and trains.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0460-2023 was adopted by the City Council on April 27, 2023, after review by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT must report installation locations to the council every year.

The draft plan, released in December, proposes increased spacing between stops, route changes, and new 'Rush' service. Key changes include the elimination and rerouting of the B48, which officials say 'removes a vital connection between Western Crown Heights and Greenpoint without any adequate transit replacement.' Forrest and others argue these cuts threaten accessibility for seniors and people with disabilities. Community members warn that longer distances between stops will hit the most vulnerable hardest. The MTA claims the redesign will bring 'more reliable, frequent service with better connections,' but public feedback shows deep concern. The plan remains under review, with workshops ongoing and legal hurdles for new bus lanes due to budget and staffing woes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to require every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter, and other legal motorized vehicle to be registered with the Department of Transportation and display a visible license plate. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.' Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections. The streets stayed dangerous. The cars kept their edge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
