The driver, drunk, kept going. He hit a cyclist, two more people, and crashed into a van. The family’s lawyer <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/07/us-news/family-of-turkish-immigrant-killed-in-dwi-crash-sues-nyc-bars/>said the family is devastated and still in disbelief</a>.

Cyclists, pedestrians, children—all struck. The city passed Sammy’s Law. It gives New York the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit has not changed yet. The law sits idle. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. Promises are made. Streets stay the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every injury, every death, is preventable. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on.

The proposal urges the Department of Transportation to close Broadway to most vehicles between 14th and 34th Streets next year, with future expansion to 42nd Street. The matter follows a severe June 20 crash where a taxi hit a cyclist. The politicians’ letter states: 'A safer, more pedestrian-friendly corridor must be achieved quickly.' Powers, along with Mark Levine, Carlina Rivera, and Erik Bottcher, argue the city’s current plan—limited to small plazas and traffic restrictions—is not enough. They demand bold action to protect pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s response: their plans already include many changes, but the council members say it falls short.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced strong support, stating, 'This administration welcomes this bill, which is in line with both our vision for a greener, more connected city.' Rivera criticized the current system: 'Many of New York's 100 miles of greenways exist only on paper with no cohesive city network.' The bill would require city agencies to present a plan by July 1 next year. It also shifts responsibility from City Planning to agencies that actually build and maintain greenways.

Cyclist Allegra Legrande praised De La Rosa’s advocacy and demanded real-time updates and safe routes for vulnerable road users.

Kids’ lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On June 1, 2022, New York City Council members held a press conference in response to a Streetsblog report exposing high crash rates near schools. The event, not tied to a specific bill, saw Council Members Jennifer Gutiérrez, Julie Menin, Alexa Avilés, and Carlina Rivera demand urgent safety upgrades. The matter summary reads: 'City lawmakers and transportation and education advocates expressed outrage over a recent Streetsblog report on dangerous school streets, demanding the city do more to prevent drivers from harming children outside schools.' Lawmakers called the findings 'egregious' and 'unconscionable.' They urged more crossing guards, traffic calming, and car-free hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez signaled openness to restricting cars during key times. The council’s stance is clear: the city’s inaction puts children, especially those of color, at deadly risk. Lawmakers want swift, systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed at Brooklyn Community Boards 10 and 11, aims to fix potholes, resurface the path, and repair the seawall. The presentation, however, lacked any guarantee of a safe alternate route for cyclists and pedestrians. Brooklyn Borough Commissioner Martin Maher admitted, 'I can't make any promises.' Council Member Carlina Rivera’s office noted her bill would require protections for cyclists around work zones, highlighting the gap in current planning. Executive Director Terri Carta of the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative said, 'NYC Parks and DOT need to provide a safe alternative for greenway users during construction.' Despite DOT’s willingness to help, no concrete detour exists.
