A car does not stop. In the last twelve months, <strong>92 people were injured</strong> on Gramercy’s streets. <strong>Four suffered serious injuries</strong>. One never made it home. The numbers are not just numbers.

The driver, drunk, kept going. He hit a cyclist, two more people, and crashed into a van. The family’s lawyer <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/07/us-news/family-of-turkish-immigrant-killed-in-dwi-crash-sues-nyc-bars/>said the family is devastated and still in disbelief</a>.

Only the echo of loss.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>No new deaths this year.</strong> But the wounds keep coming. Cyclists, pedestrians, children—all struck. The city passed Sammy’s Law. It gives New York the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit has not changed yet. The law sits idle. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. Promises are made. Streets stay the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every injury, every death, is preventable. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Build streets that forgive mistakes. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.
