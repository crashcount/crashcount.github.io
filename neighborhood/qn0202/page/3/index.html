The collision resulted in severe head bleeding for the cyclist, who was conscious but helmetless. The report states the truck 'kept rolling' while 'the bike did not.' Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. The cyclist’s lack of helmet is noted in the report, but the primary error identified is the truck driver's inattention. The impact was forceful enough to cause blood to pool on the asphalt, underscoring the grave consequences of driver distraction on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

A 24-year-old male moped driver traveling west was hit at the center front end by a northbound SUV making a left turn. The SUV driver, licensed in Florida, struck the moped's center front end with the vehicle's right front quarter panel.
