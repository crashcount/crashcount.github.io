Seventeen seriously hurt.</strong> In Sunnyside, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers keep coming. They do not slow. They do not care. In the last twelve months alone, three people died. Four were left with injuries that will not heal. One was a child. One was old enough to remember the city before cars ruled it. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Over 1,000 people injured.</strong> The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken legs, crushed skulls, lives split open on the street. The youngest was under 18. The oldest was over 75. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> They killed. They maimed. They left families to pick up what was left. Motorcycles and mopeds tore through flesh and bone. Bikes, too, left their mark, but the weight of steel and speed falls hardest from the biggest machines.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They point to new laws—like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. But in Sunnyside, the speed stays the same. The city has the power to drop the limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. <a href=../../take_action/>demand action</a>.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> They cut speeding by more than half where installed. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Albany drags its feet. The city waits. People die.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Every day without action is another day someone does not come home. The city has the tools. The leaders have the power. <strong>What they lack is urgency.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras.

Both bills require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create public trackers for capital projects tied to the Streets Master Plan. Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.
