Seventeen seriously hurt.</strong> In Sunnyside, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers keep coming. They do not slow. They do not care. In the last twelve months alone, three people died. Four were left with injuries that will not heal. One was a child. One was old enough to remember the city before cars ruled it. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Over 1,000 people injured.</strong> The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken legs, crushed skulls, lives split open on the street. The youngest was under 18. The oldest was over 75. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> They killed. They maimed. They left families to pick up what was left. Motorcycles and mopeds tore through flesh and bone. Bikes, too, left their mark, but the weight of steel and speed falls hardest from the biggest machines.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They point to new laws—like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. But in Sunnyside, the speed stays the same. The city has the power to drop the limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. <a href=../../take_action/>demand action</a>.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> They cut speeding by more than half where installed. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Albany drags its feet. The city waits. People die.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Every day without action is another day someone does not come home. The city has the tools. The leaders have the power. <strong>What they lack is urgency.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras.

The plan, part of the larger Fix The MTA Package, would phase in free local and Select Bus Service, increase bus frequency by 20%, freeze fares, and expand permanent bus lane camera enforcement. Funding would rise from $200 million in 2023 to $638 million in 2026, with $488 million yearly for more buses and $300 million annually for frequent subways. Mamdani called the proposal 'urgent and necessary,' stressing that 'seniors, working class New Yorkers, people who use the bus the most are able to do so without fear of being priced out.' Gianaris said, 'incrementalism...is not working.' The lawmakers urge bold action to ensure public transit is accessible, affordable, and excellent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, coordinated with Council Member Julie Menin, used fiber-reinforced polymer panels to shield riders from the bridge’s hazardous metal grating. The official matter: 'Roosevelt Island Bridge bike lane now covered for a safer, smoother ride.' Won praised the project’s quick finish and its promise of safer, more comfortable biking.

Riders and pedestrians squeeze into a single lane. Car lanes stay open. Bike trips surge. Crashes rise. Advocates and Council Member Julie Won demand action. City puts drivers first, safety last.</p><p class=mb3>On December 5, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) delayed expanding pedestrian and cyclist space on the Queensboro Bridge. The plan, promised by former Mayor Bill de Blasio, would have made the southern roadway pedestrian-only and the northern path bike-only by the end of 2022. Instead, DOT postponed this until at least late 2023, citing the need to keep seven of nine car lanes open during bridge rehabilitation. The matter summary states: 'The city is delaying the expansion of space for cyclists and pedestrians on the Queensboro Bridge, despite a significant increase in bike traffic.' Council Member Julie Won criticized the move, saying, 'The city must open the south outer roadway immediately for our safety. DOT should stop prioritizing cars over the safety of pedestrians.' Advocates point to rising bike ridership and crashes on the narrow shared path. DOT maintains the project cannot be expedited due to driver needs, despite evidence that more bike infrastructure boosts usage without hurting traffic elsewhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight moves to City Planning.</p><p class=mb3>On November 7, 2022, Queens Community Board 2 passed a resolution rejecting a rezoning application for a Lincoln SUV dealership on Northern Boulevard, Woodside. The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She called the agency’s excuses garbage. Cyclists and walkers remain squeezed into a narrow, dangerous path. DOT’s delays keep vulnerable road users at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On September 15, 2022, Council Member Julie Won publicly criticized the Department of Transportation for delaying the conversion of the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway into a pedestrian-only lane. The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to amend city law by establishing a parking permit enforcement unit within the Department of Transportation. Its summary reads: 'This bill would require the Department of Transportation to create a parking permit enforcement unit that would be dedicated to the enforcement of laws and rules relating to misuse of city-issued parking permits.' The primary sponsor was Kristin Richardson Jordan, joined by Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Julie Won, Rita C. Joseph, Crystal Hudson, Farah N. Louis, and Lincoln Restler. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. No safety analyst assessed its impact on vulnerable road users.
