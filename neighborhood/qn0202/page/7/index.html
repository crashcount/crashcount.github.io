Seventeen seriously hurt.</strong> In Sunnyside, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers keep coming. They do not slow. They do not care. In the last twelve months alone, three people died. Four were left with injuries that will not heal. One was a child. One was old enough to remember the city before cars ruled it. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Over 1,000 people injured.</strong> The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken legs, crushed skulls, lives split open on the street. The youngest was under 18. The oldest was over 75. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> They killed. They maimed. They left families to pick up what was left. Motorcycles and mopeds tore through flesh and bone. Bikes, too, left their mark, but the weight of steel and speed falls hardest from the biggest machines.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They point to new laws—like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. But in Sunnyside, the speed stays the same. The city has the power to drop the limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. <a href=../../take_action/>demand action</a>.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> They cut speeding by more than half where installed. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Albany drags its feet. The city waits. People die.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Every day without action is another day someone does not come home. The city has the tools. The leaders have the power. <strong>What they lack is urgency.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The move targets deadly blind spots. Advocates demand faster action. DOT lags behind. Intersections remain killing grounds for children and pedestrians. The city stalls. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On December 6, 2024, Council Member Julie Won (D-Queens) introduced a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of all intersections citywide—a measure known as daylighting. The bill, now before the City Council, would require the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The matter summary states: 'Parking right up against intersections blocks sight lines for pedestrians and drivers, leading to people to have to peak out into the street to see oncoming traffic.' Won said, 'Daylighting saves lives.' Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans back the bill, citing slow DOT progress and urgent need. Intersections account for 55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries, according to DOT. The bill follows a year of tragic child deaths and mounting public pressure for universal daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
