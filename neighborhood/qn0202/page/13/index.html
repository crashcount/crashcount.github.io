Seventeen seriously hurt.</strong> In Sunnyside, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers keep coming. They do not slow. They do not care. In the last twelve months alone, three people died. Four were left with injuries that will not heal. One was a child. One was old enough to remember the city before cars ruled it. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Over 1,000 people injured.</strong> The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken legs, crushed skulls, lives split open on the street. The youngest was under 18. The oldest was over 75. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> They killed. They maimed. They left families to pick up what was left. Motorcycles and mopeds tore through flesh and bone. Bikes, too, left their mark, but the weight of steel and speed falls hardest from the biggest machines.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They point to new laws—like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. But in Sunnyside, the speed stays the same. The city has the power to drop the limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. <a href=../../take_action/>demand action</a>.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> They cut speeding by more than half where installed. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Albany drags its feet. The city waits. People die.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Every day without action is another day someone does not come home. The city has the tools. The leaders have the power. <strong>What they lack is urgency.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The incident, which killed 74-year-old Be Tran at Myrtle and Seneca Avenues, triggered public outcry. Gianaris criticized the city’s process, saying, 'They have to wait until that happens to get the score high enough to realize that an intersection needs protection.' He joined activists from the Ridgewood Tenants Union and Transportation Alternatives, demanding new signals and better street design. Gianaris said he contacted the Department of Transportation a year earlier with no result. The city claims over 20 traffic control approvals in Ridgewood, but residents and advocates say it’s not enough. The call comes as pedestrian deaths and injuries continue to climb citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0604-2022 was introduced on August 11, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to 'establish priority for sidewalk repairs at developments operated by the New York City Housing Authority,' giving first priority to senior-only NYCHA buildings, then to other NYCHA sites. Emergencies at non-NYCHA properties could override this order, with required notification to local officials. The bill required DOT to report on completed and pending NYCHA sidewalk repairs by June 30, 2023. Council Member Alexa Avilés sponsored the bill, joined by Abreu, Brooks-Powers, Restler, Hanif, Won, Nurse, Gutiérrez, and Sanchez. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without enactment. Sidewalk hazards at NYCHA developments persist, leaving vulnerable residents exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
