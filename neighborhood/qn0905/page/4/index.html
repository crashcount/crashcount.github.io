The proposal aims to increase housing near transit, allow mixed-use zoning, and eliminate parking mandates. Council Members Joann Ariola and Vicki Paladino led opposition, calling the plan an 'unmitigated disaster' and disputing housing data. Ariola argued, 'That's what they bought in the suburbs for.' Other Queens officials and residents echoed fears for single-family homeowners and suburban 'character.' In contrast, Borough President Donovan Richards's spokesperson and some residents supported the reforms, citing the city's affordability crisis. The majority of public testimony favored the proposal, but entrenched opposition from Queens officials remains strong. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that the department of transportation maintain curb heights following street construction,' targets a simple failure: after street work, curbs often vanish, water pools, and property owners get fined for city mistakes. Council Member Joann Ariola sponsors, joined by Holden, Paladino, and Vernikov. The bill orders DOT to restore curbs to proper height after any street, sidewalk, or gutter work. The committee has not voted. The bill aims to stop flooding and fines, but leaves the daily hazard for walkers and wheelchair users unaddressed until passed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The SUV's right front quarter panel struck the bicyclist, who sustained abrasions to the knee and lower leg but remained conscious and was not ejected. The report cites 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor. The SUV driver was licensed and traveling straight ahead. The bicyclist was not wearing safety equipment. Vehicle damage was limited to the SUV's right front quarter panel, while the bike sustained no damage.

Homeowners must report damage. City crews must fix broken, buckled, or hazardous walks caused by city trees. Private owners are off the hook.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0221-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on February 28, 2024. The bill states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the parks department to repair damage caused by trees owned by the city of New York.' Council Members James F. Gennaro (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and Inna Vernikov back the measure. Their bill requires the Parks Department to repair sidewalks damaged by city-owned trees, removing the burden from homeowners of one-, two-, or three-family homes. Owners must notify the city if tree roots break the walk. If the damage is not tree-related, owners still have ninety days to fix it. The bill aims to clarify responsibility and ensure city action on hazards caused by its own trees.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
