Since 2022, three people have died and 373 have been injured in crashes here. Two of the dead were pedestrians. One was crushed by a truck while working in the street at Atlantic Avenue and Woodhaven Boulevard. Another, a 47-year-old man, was killed crossing Woodhaven Boulevard. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives stopped cold.</p><p><strong>In the last year, 54 people have been hurt in 107 crashes.</strong> Not one death this year, but the wounds keep coming. Cyclists, children, the old—no one is spared. A 53-year-old man was hit while riding his bike at Forest Parkway and Jamaica Avenue in May. He survived. Others did not.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are the main weapons. Trucks killed. Buses injured. Bikes and mopeds are in the mix, but the steel giants do the worst damage. The street is a gauntlet. The curb is no refuge.</p><h3 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called the crisis what it is: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/02/23/dot-commish-promises-safety-improvements-at-queens-intersection-where-pedestrian-was-run-over-three-times>traffic violence</a>. She demanded the city take control of speed limits and cameras. Senator Joe Addabbo voted yes on bills to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>curb repeat speeders</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a>. Council Member Joann Ariola voted against expanding speed cameras, even as her own car racked up <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>27 school-zone speeding tickets</a>. She warned about jaywalking but not about the drivers who kill.</p><p>A witness to a recent bus crash said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus.&rdquo;</a> The pain is not abstract. It is felt in the bone and the blood.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without a citywide 20 mph limit, every delay in redesigning streets, every vote against cameras is a choice. The bodies pile up. The silence is complicity.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand slower speeds, more cameras, safer crossings.</strong> Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
