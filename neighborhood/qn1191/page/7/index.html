No one died, but the wounds run deep. Children are not spared—<strong>21 kids hurt in a single year</strong>. These are not just numbers. They are broken legs, shattered faces, and families waiting in hospital halls.</p><p><strong>SUVs hit hardest.</strong> In the past three years, SUVs caused three pedestrian injuries, including one serious. No bikes, no buses. Just heavy metal and flesh. The parkway is a river of steel. The young and the old are swept up the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city says it is acting. They point to new laws and cameras. <strong>&ldquo;In order to make New York City the best place to raise a family, we need to be safer at every level — including on our streets,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/13/senior-pedestrian-moped-rider-killed-in-separate-nyc-crashes-in-24-hours/>said Mayor Adams</a>. But the crashes keep coming. The city lowered speed limits in some places. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are placed. The rest is luck.</p><p>Police say they are watching. <strong>&ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/13/senior-pedestrian-moped-rider-killed-in-separate-nyc-crashes-in-24-hours/>said Commissioner Caban</a>. But in Alley Pond Park, the numbers do not move. The pain stays the same.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>No deaths this year. But the injuries pile up.</strong> The city claims progress, but the park is still a danger zone. The council and community board have not done enough. The roads are wide. The crossings are long. The cars are fast. The children are small.</p><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits and more cameras. Demand streets that protect walkers, not just drivers.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for the first death.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He insists that reducing car use will free up space, improve safety, and boost quality of life. Turner’s stance: congestion pricing is vital for safer, healthier streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams argued, “MTA is a statewide obligation. We’re doing our share.” State lawmakers, including Assembly Member Ed Braunstein and State Senator Liz Krueger, countered that the city should help. Hochul’s budget would shift more costs—like Access-A-Ride and student Metrocards—to the city. Progressive lawmakers suggested taxing the wealthy and freezing fares. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins warned, “To increase fares would be detrimental.” The debate continues as the legislature drafts its own budget. No direct safety analysis was provided, but funding gaps threaten transit service, putting vulnerable riders at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He challenges Paladino’s push for cyclist licensing and increased law enforcement, urging her to listen to transportation experts and everyday New Yorkers.
