She added, "So if you buy one of these lasers, be sure to NOT point them at any cameras, because they could be permanently damaged!" Paladino also shared footage of vigilantes destroying enforcement cameras in London, warning, "it would be foolish to believe the same won't happen here in due time." Her comments came the day the MTA launched congestion pricing, which charges drivers to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. Paladino’s stance undermines the city’s efforts to control traffic and protect vulnerable road users. No safety analyst has yet assessed the direct impact, but weakening enforcement threatens those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
