The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children.

The bill, sponsored by Councilmember Bob Holden, claims to address 'the proliferation of these vehicles' and their impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety. Councilmember Vickie Paladino, District 19, insisted, 'This is a safety issue.' Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez countered, 'We agree with the intent, but we believe that mandating registration and licensing is not a solution.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams warned the bill would 'have a disparate impact on low-income individuals, people of color, and undocumented migrants.' A separate resolution from Councilmember Gale Brewer supports licensing only for commercial e-bikes.

Committee members Shirley Secunda, Susanna Aaron, Janet Liff, and Jeannine Kiely all voiced strong opposition, calling the bill redundant and inadequate.

A 17-year-old front passenger suffered severe crush injuries to his hips and upper legs. He was wearing a lap belt and harness and remained conscious after the collision.

A 17-year-old boy, belted in front, screamed through crushed hips.' No actions by the passenger are listed as contributing to the crash.
