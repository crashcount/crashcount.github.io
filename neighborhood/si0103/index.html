A 67-year-old cyclist died on Bay Street. A young driver died on Narrows Road North. These are not numbers. They are lives. Each crash leaves a hole. Each injury is a story cut short.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> In the last year, every pedestrian injury came from a car, SUV, or truck.

The weight of steel always wins.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can act. The Mayor can act. But the speed limit on most streets is still 25 mph. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> They cut speeding by more than half. But the law that keeps them running is always up for debate. Leaders can fight for these tools. Or they can let them lapse and let the danger return.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras.

Streets clear. Delays drop. Fewer cars mean more space for people. The city breathes. Vulnerable road users gain ground. Data shows real relief, not empty promises.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the Regional Plan Association released a report on congestion pricing’s impact. The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use. Safety analysts note congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and supports safer, more equitable streets. The program’s future now rests with the federal courts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031. The move targets driver speed, a key factor in crash severity, and signals a shift toward automated enforcement on major city crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The road has been car-free since the pandemic, serving as a haven for walkers and cyclists. The Parks Department, once supportive of a car-free park, agreed to the reopening after political pressure. The matter centers on whether car access improves safety after a recent attempted rape. Advocates, including Transportation Alternatives, argue, 'Allowing cars in Silver Lake is not about public safety; it's about driver convenience.' Locals warn that reintroducing cars endangers children and vulnerable users, undermining the park’s safety and purpose. A petition and rally oppose the move, highlighting that traffic violence poses a greater threat than rare park crimes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
