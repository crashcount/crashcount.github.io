A 67-year-old cyclist died on Bay Street. A young driver died on Narrows Road North. These are not numbers. They are lives. Each crash leaves a hole. Each injury is a story cut short.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> In the last year, every pedestrian injury came from a car, SUV, or truck.

The weight of steel always wins.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can act. The Mayor can act. But the speed limit on most streets is still 25 mph. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> They cut speeding by more than half. But the law that keeps them running is always up for debate. Leaders can fight for these tools. Or they can let them lapse and let the danger return.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
