The crash injured a 23-year-old female front-seat passenger, causing contusions to her lower leg. Police cited driver inattention as the contributing factor. Both vehicles sustained front-end damage.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred at 22:25 on Bay Street, Staten Island, involving two SUVs traveling south. One driver was going straight ahead, while the other was making a left turn. The point of impact was the center front end of one vehicle and the left front quarter panel of the other. The report identifies driver inattention and distraction as the primary contributing factors. A 23-year-old female front passenger was injured, suffering contusions to her knee, lower leg, and foot. She was conscious and restrained by a lap belt and harness, with airbag deployment noted. Both drivers were licensed in New York.

The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented.

The coalition promised fierce resistance, demanding the governor keep the program paused.</p><p class=mb3>On November 14, 2024, State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton (District 23) led a bipartisan rally against the revival of congestion pricing. The event, held at the Verrazano Bridge, included U.S. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Council Member Joe Borelli, and others. The group opposed Governor Hochul's plan to re-implement congestion pricing, which would charge vehicles entering lower Manhattan. The rally's matter title: 'Staten Island, Brooklyn pols rally against congestion pricing as Hochul considers reviving program.' Scarcella-Spanton pledged to 'fight tooth and nail until congestion pricing is dead.' Brooklyn Assembly Member Jaime Williams and others condemned the plan as unfair to transit deserts and working-class communities. No safety analyst assessment was provided regarding the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced November 13, 2024, by Council Members Chris Banks (primary), Kamillah Hanks, Frank Morano, and David M. Carr. The bill orders the city to study which schools have closed each year and to remove speed cameras from those erased school zones. The matter title reads: 'Annual study to identify non-operational schools and the subsequent removal of speed cameras from eliminated school speed zones.' If passed, the law would strip cameras from streets where schools once stood, erasing a layer of protection for people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
