The move aims to slow cars where people walk, bike, and gather. Resolution passes. Streets may breathe easier. The city pushes Albany to let it set its own pace.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0079-2024, adopted June 6, 2024 by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, urges the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.315/A.1416. The measure would let New York City set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets in the Open Streets program. The matter title reads: 'authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Carlina Rivera. The committee approved the resolution with strong support. The bill targets streets where pedestrians and cyclists mix with traffic. Lower speeds mean fewer crashes and less severe injuries. The council’s action puts pressure on Albany to give the city the power to protect people where they are most exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure calls for redesigning streets to protect all users, not just drivers. The vote was not unanimous—several senators voted no, but the majority carried it through. The bill’s focus is clear: safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles.

Introduced February 28, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to assess at least 100 speed camera locations each year for raised speed reducer feasibility. The bill reads: 'requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), David M. Carr, Sandra Ung, Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, and Vickie Paladino sponsor the measure. If DOT finds a location suitable, it must install a raised speed reducer within a year. DOT must also report annually, track changes in dangerous driving, and recommend if cameras are still needed. The bill aims to force physical changes where drivers speed, not just rely on cameras.
