The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Gale A. Brewer, Shaun Abreu, Lynn C. Schulman, and Amanda Farías backed the resolution. The bill would raise penalties for e-scooter hit-and-runs from a violation to a misdemeanor or felony, and seeks to add e-bikes to the law.

The editorial, titled "With politicians fearful of the TWU, a public referendum is the answer," criticizes the City Council’s failure to act on a bill that would replace horses with electric carriages. Schulman highlights that only 18 of 51 council members sponsor the bill, despite strong public support and past campaign promises. She names Justin Brennan, Gale Brewer, Julie Menin, and herself among those who have not advanced the legislation. Schulman blames union influence for the council’s inaction, citing 115 accidents and 27 horse deaths over decades.

No action taken.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1116-2023 was introduced on June 22, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill required the Department of Sanitation and NYPD to tow vehicles that block streets or lack visible, valid license plates, registration, or inspection stickers. The matter summary reads: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code...in relation to towing vehicles that are an encumbrance on the street or that lack, improperly display, or obscure valid license plates, registration stickers, inspection stickers, or vehicle identification numbers.” Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Salamanca, Brannan, Feliz, Stevens, Ung, Riley, and Schulman. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. Removing untraceable or abandoned vehicles could have reduced street dangers for pedestrians and cyclists, but the measure stalled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Porous pavement, wider sidewalks, and bike lanes now line the block. The project promises less flooding and safer passage for people on foot and bike. Connections to the ferry and boardwalk improved.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2023, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) marked the completion of a major infrastructure project in Rockaway. The work, running from Beach Channel Drive to Shore Front Parkway, added porous pavement, new bike lanes, and wider pedestrian walkways. The city says the 11,000 square feet of new surface can absorb nearly 1.3 million gallons of stormwater each year. Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes. The changes give cyclists and pedestrians an easier, safer route to the Rockaway ferry terminal and boardwalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They demanded lawmakers pass Sammy’s Law. The bill lets the city set its own speed limits. Brad Hoylman-Sigal led the charge. The law is named for a child killed by a car. The fight is urgent. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2023, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and other NYC officials lobbied the state legislature to pass key transportation and housing bills before the session ends June 9. The centerpiece is 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let New York City set its own speed limits, potentially lowering them to 20 mph. Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted. Mayor Adams’ administration also pushed for affordable housing reforms. The push for Sammy’s Law is a fight to give NYC control over its streets and protect vulnerable road users from deadly speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
