The matter summary: 'expanding New York's speed camera program.' Council Member Joann Ariola, representing southern Queens and the Rockaways, voted no. Ariola argued, 'these cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,' and claimed repeat offenders with fake plates escape punishment. Ariola’s SUV has 48 violations since 2017, including 27 for speeding in school zones and two for running red lights. She insists her record did not influence her vote. Critics, like StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure, highlight the contradiction between her opposition to speed cameras and her stated concern for school safety.

The measure, approved by state lawmakers three years ago, would charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The MTA faces hundreds of follow-up questions from the Federal Highway Administration, delaying the required environmental assessment. Ariola argued, 'I don’t believe it will work, in fact I believe it will make the city more unmanageable to travel through.' The plan is intended to reduce traffic, lower car pollution, and fund MTA capital improvements. Delays put $1 billion in annual funding at risk, threatening upgrades like accessible subway stations and zero-emission buses.

The vote was 43 in favor, seven against. The matter summary: 'giving the state Legislature the go-ahead to pass a three-year extension and expansion of New York City's speed camera program that allows them to operate 24/7.' Council Member David Carr (District 50) voted no. Other Republicans and two Democrats also opposed. Ydanis Rodriguez, City Transportation Commissioner, said, 'Cameras will be 24/7 the whole year.' The bill now moves to the state legislature, which must act before June 2. No formal safety analyst note was provided for this action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure died in committee. No tickets, no deterrence. Buses and riders left exposed. Streets lose protection when traffic surges and rules go dark.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0170-2022 was introduced on April 14, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill proposed 'suspending bus lane enforcement on legal holidays.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, Joseph C. Borelli, and Inna Vernikov backed the measure. The bill required the Department of Transportation to stop using cameras to enforce bus lane rules during legal holidays. The legislation was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. With enforcement paused, bus lanes would have lost their shield. Riders and pedestrians would face more cars in bus lanes, more chaos, and less safety when streets are busiest. Vulnerable road users would have paid the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
