Three were over 65. In three and a half years, <strong>595 people have been injured</strong> on Madison’s streets. One crash after another. A cyclist, age 35, killed by an SUV on Nostrand Avenue. A 77-year-old woman crushed by a dump truck at Avenue P. A 70-year-old man, struck and killed by an SUV on Kings Highway. The numbers do not stop. <strong>224 crashes in the last year alone.</strong></p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians. In the last 12 months, 14 children were hurt. Eight people over 75 were injured. The only thing that changes is the name on the report.</p><h3 id=whats-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What’s Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>The city claims progress. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let New York lower speed limits. They count miles of new bike lanes and redesigned intersections. But in Madison, the carnage continues. <strong>No elders killed in the past year.</strong> One cyclist dead. One child dead. The city’s words do not stop the bleeding.</p><p><strong>The vehicles that kill are the same:</strong> SUVs, trucks, buses. In the last three years, trucks and buses killed two people and seriously injured two more. SUVs and cars killed one, seriously injured one, and left 19 with moderate injuries. Bikes killed no one. The danger is heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=the-slow-disaster>The Slow Disaster</h3><p><strong>Crashes are not fate.</strong> They are not random. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by city leaders, by those who design and police the streets. Every delay in lowering speed limits, every missing crosswalk, every unprotected bike lane is a choice. In Madison, the cost is paid in blood.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong> Every day of delay is another family shattered. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving. The article highlights the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill, which would require speed limiter devices for drivers with six or more camera violations in a year. Amber Adler, a local advocate, calls Ocean Parkway a 'safety menace' and urges passage of the bill. The crash exposes gaps in enforcement and policy, leaving repeat offenders unchecked and vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street remains deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On March 31, 2025, Assembly Member Michael Novakhov publicly opposed a state bill requiring speed-limiting devices for cars owned by repeat speeders. The statement came at the funeral for Natasha Saada and her children, killed by a speeding driver on Ocean Parkway. Novakhov argued, 'six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,' and claimed, 'any driver can get much more than six.' He also denounced speed cameras, saying, 'we have too many,' and that they punish regular drivers. The bill’s matter summary centers on requiring devices for vehicles with six violations in a year. Community members and advocates at the funeral demanded stronger accountability and cited the area’s deadly history. Other local politicians, including Kalman Yeger and Simcha Felder, have also opposed speed safety measures. The Department of Transportation has not recommended major changes to Ocean Parkway, despite ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article notes that the intersection is a known trouble spot, with Collins stating, "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The report highlights systemic issues: delivery app pressures, lack of regulation, and a street design that encourages risky moves.

Streets stay dangerous for walkers.</p><p class=mb3>On March 23, 2025, the New York City Council passed a bill to decriminalize jaywalking. The measure, championed by Councilwoman Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, cleared the chamber in a veto-proof 40-8 vote. The bill's matter title: 'Jaywalking in NYC is set to be legal.' The legislation eliminates the $250 fine for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione testified against the bill, warning, 'Over the last five years, 200 people lost their lives while crossing the street mid-block or against the signal, making up about 34 percent of all pedestrian fatalities.' Mayor Eric Adams neither signed nor vetoed the bill, allowing it to become law. City Hall and NYPD officials continue to urge pedestrians to follow traffic rules. The Department of Transportation must now draft rules to implement the change. Vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
