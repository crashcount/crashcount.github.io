Three were over 65. In three and a half years, <strong>595 people have been injured</strong> on Madison’s streets. One crash after another. A cyclist, age 35, killed by an SUV on Nostrand Avenue. A 77-year-old woman crushed by a dump truck at Avenue P. A 70-year-old man, struck and killed by an SUV on Kings Highway. The numbers do not stop. <strong>224 crashes in the last year alone.</strong></p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians. In the last 12 months, 14 children were hurt. Eight people over 75 were injured. The only thing that changes is the name on the report.</p><h3 id=whats-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What’s Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>The city claims progress. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let New York lower speed limits. They count miles of new bike lanes and redesigned intersections. But in Madison, the carnage continues. <strong>No elders killed in the past year.</strong> One cyclist dead. One child dead. The city’s words do not stop the bleeding.</p><p><strong>The vehicles that kill are the same:</strong> SUVs, trucks, buses. In the last three years, trucks and buses killed two people and seriously injured two more. SUVs and cars killed one, seriously injured one, and left 19 with moderate injuries. Bikes killed no one. The danger is heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=the-slow-disaster>The Slow Disaster</h3><p><strong>Crashes are not fate.</strong> They are not random. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by city leaders, by those who design and police the streets. Every delay in lowering speed limits, every missing crosswalk, every unprotected bike lane is a choice. In Madison, the cost is paid in blood.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong> Every day of delay is another family shattered. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
