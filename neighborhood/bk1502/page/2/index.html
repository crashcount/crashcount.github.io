Three were over 65. In three and a half years, <strong>595 people have been injured</strong> on Madison’s streets. One crash after another. A cyclist, age 35, killed by an SUV on Nostrand Avenue. A 77-year-old woman crushed by a dump truck at Avenue P. A 70-year-old man, struck and killed by an SUV on Kings Highway. The numbers do not stop. <strong>224 crashes in the last year alone.</strong></p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians. In the last 12 months, 14 children were hurt. Eight people over 75 were injured. The only thing that changes is the name on the report.</p><h3 id=whats-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What’s Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>The city claims progress. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let New York lower speed limits. They count miles of new bike lanes and redesigned intersections. But in Madison, the carnage continues. <strong>No elders killed in the past year.</strong> One cyclist dead. One child dead. The city’s words do not stop the bleeding.</p><p><strong>The vehicles that kill are the same:</strong> SUVs, trucks, buses. In the last three years, trucks and buses killed two people and seriously injured two more. SUVs and cars killed one, seriously injured one, and left 19 with moderate injuries. Bikes killed no one. The danger is heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=the-slow-disaster>The Slow Disaster</h3><p><strong>Crashes are not fate.</strong> They are not random. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by city leaders, by those who design and police the streets. Every delay in lowering speed limits, every missing crosswalk, every unprotected bike lane is a choice. In Madison, the cost is paid in blood.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong> Every day of delay is another family shattered. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lafleur was in the crosswalk with the walk signal when the driver of a 2025 Mercedes Benz GLC 300 struck her. A witness told Streetsblog, "The lady spin around and sped through," and described hearing the impact. The article notes that police have not released the driver's name. The incident occurred as NYPD focused enforcement on electric bikes, while drivers continue to cause deadly harm. The tragedy highlights the ongoing danger to pedestrians and raises questions about city policy and street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031.

It was introduced November 13, 2024, and passed committee and full Council votes on April 10, 2025. The law, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to tracking progress made towards the requirements of the streets master plan,' demands the Department of Transportation post annual and monthly updates on all benchmark projects—protected bike lanes, bus lanes, signals, and upgrades. Council Member Julie Won led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Ayala, and others. The law requires public reporting on project status, funding, delays, and overruns. This measure brings hard oversight and transparency to the city’s street safety promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, handled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced February 28, 2024. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to conduct a comprehensive Environmental Impact Study on the viability of the proposed QueensLink project.' Council Member Robert F. Holden led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Ariola, Banks, Joseph, Gennaro, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. All committee members voted 'affirmative.' The QueensLink would restore 3.5 miles of dormant rail, linking northern and southern Queens, and could serve tens of thousands daily.

Parking jumped from 24 to 35 spaces. Vernikov cited 'neighborhood character and parking' as reasons. Her Land Use director said, 'We have to fight to protect every parking spot.' The local community board and Vernikov demanded a one-to-one parking ratio. Rachel Fee, an advocate, called it 'inexcusable' to have more parking than homes in a transit-rich city. The move prioritizes cars over people, deepening the housing crisis and increasing danger for vulnerable road users.

No students were on the bus at the time. The victims were hospitalized with serious injuries.

The driver had a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' according to State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The bill would require speed-limiting devices for drivers with repeated offenses, targeting those with 11 or more points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall to demand action. The article notes that auto deaths have outpaced gun deaths in New York City for two years. The bill mirrors laws for drunk driving and follows stalled efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act.
