One was on a bike. Two were in cars. Trucks and buses are in too many of these crashes, and they hit hard. That is the record, not a story.</p><h3 id=avenue-p-and-kings-highway-wont-forgive>Avenue P and Kings Highway won’t forgive</h3><p>At <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue P and East 19th</a> a dump truck going straight killed a 77‑year‑old woman in the crosswalk in 2023. On <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Kings Highway</a>, an SUV struck and killed a 70‑year‑old man in 2024. The city’s own rollup shows trucks and buses causing a share of pedestrian deaths and severe injuries here, out of proportion to their numbers.</p><p>Peak harm comes when the streets are full. Injury counts jump in the afternoon—2 p.m., 3 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m. The worst corridors are named in the crash logs: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue P</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Kings Highway</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Ocean Avenue</a>, and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Nostrand Avenue</a>.</p><h3 id=a-cyclist-down-on-nostrand-and-avenue-r>A cyclist down on Nostrand and Avenue R</h3><p>On Nostrand at Avenue R, a driver in an SUV hit a man on an e‑bike at night in 2023. The rider was ejected and died. The city dataset shows the SUV “going straight.” The bike was “going straight.” The man never got up. The case sits in the ledger as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4633095</a>.</p><h3 id=older-new-yorkers-carry-the-toll>Older New Yorkers carry the toll</h3><p>The dead here skew old. Ages 74, 77, 70, and 90 appear next to “Apparent Death” in the files. The neighborhood record lists four pedestrian deaths, one cyclist, two occupants. The serious injuries are few on paper, but the injuries are not: 682 hurt since 2022. Numbers don’t limp; people do.</p><h3 id=what-keeps-breaking-people-here>What keeps breaking people here</h3><p>Top listed factors in these crashes cluster under “other,” with failures to yield and distraction repeating in smaller numbers. Trucks and buses show up in the worst outcomes. The intersection list is a warning label, not a map.</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-that-kill>Fix the corners that kill</h3><p>Start with the deadly blocks. Cut turning speeds and sightline traps on Avenue P and Kings Highway. Harden the turns. Daylight every approach. Give walkers a head start. Keep heavy rigs off tight residential corners and set clear truck routes. Target the repeated hotspots with enforcement when injuries spike in the afternoon. These are the moves that stop bodies from hitting asphalt.</p><h3 id=the-politics-of-slow-or-dead>The politics of slow or dead</h3><p>City power exists to slow the cars. Albany already renewed 24/7 school‑zone cameras; the Council passed the home rule and the state acted, making cameras round‑the‑clock through 2030, according to prior reporting. Locally, some officials fight basic visibility fixes. DOT’s own report on daylighting was used by council members including <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/we-told-you-so-dots-anti-daylighting-scare-tactic-now-fuels-pro-car-pols>Inna Vernikov</a> to stall a citywide plan. She also helped <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>pause bike lanes</a> in Southern Brooklyn, despite the crash history. The deaths kept coming.</p><p>There is a tool to stop the worst repeat speeders. The Senate moved bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a> through committees to require speed‑limiting tech for drivers with repeated violations. One Brooklyn family is already in the ground because a driver with a long ticket record ran a red; two committees advanced the fix while some lawmakers missed the vote.</p><h3 id=make-the-choice>Make the choice</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. Limit the repeat offenders who treat streets like strips. Protect the corners where people die. Then do it again on the next block.</p><p>If you want this to change, take one step now. Tell City Hall and Albany to use the tools they have. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article notes that Gil was the second elderly pedestrian killed in Brooklyn this year, and cites Transportation Alternatives: '46 senior pedestrians were killed in car crashes across the city last year.'

She calls the agency reckless and accuses leaders of squeezing New Yorkers dry. The debate rages as the state hides details. Riders and workers wait in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>"Governor Hochul has gifted the MTA free reign to grift NYC taxpayers into subsidizing their every irresponsible whim because, to them, New Yorkers are nothing but piggy banks to cushion a malfunctioning agency every time it inevitably falls in a financial hole." -- Inna Vernikov</p><p class=mb3>On January 7, 2025, Councilwoman Inna Vernikov (District 48) joined the debate over new funding for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The matter, titled 'Mobility tax, other fees to prop up flailing MTA even after congestion toll — but Hochul’s plans remain secret,' centers on Governor Hochul’s undisclosed plans to hike the payroll mobility tax and add new fees, even after a $9 congestion toll. Vernikov, mentioned as a strong opponent, said, 'Governor Hochul has gifted the MTA free reign to grift NYC taxpayers into subsidizing their every irresponsible whim.' The bill’s status remains uncertain, with the state legislature previously rejecting a similar tax hike. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The debate continues in committee, with business leaders and councilmembers warning of harm to affordability and the city’s business climate.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
