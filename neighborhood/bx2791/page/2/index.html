The oldest, a senior. <strong>No one is spared.</strong></p><p>A 30-year-old man was crushed by a sedan on the Bronx River Parkway. A moped driver, age 27, ejected and killed.

An ambulance struck him as he waited for help. The news <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>reported</a> it: “Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street.”</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> They have not done it here.

Choices made by leaders who wait, who stall, who say the right words and do too little. The numbers will rise until the choices change.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

This sedan collided with two vehicles stopped in traffic: a 2020 SUV and a 2007 sedan. The point of impact was the left front bumper of the stopped vehicles and the center front end of the unlicensed sedan. The report cites "Traffic Control Disregarded" as a contributing factor, highlighting the driver's failure to obey traffic rules. The collision injured a 32-year-old male driver, an occupant of one of the stopped vehicles, who suffered fractures and dislocations to his abdomen and pelvis. The injured driver was conscious and restrained by a lap belt and harness. No victim behaviors were listed as contributing factors. The crash underscores the systemic danger posed by unlicensed drivers disregarding traffic controls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
