The oldest, a senior. <strong>No one is spared.</strong></p><p>A 30-year-old man was crushed by a sedan on the Bronx River Parkway. A moped driver, age 27, ejected and killed. Another driver, 42, dead behind the wheel.

They talk about cameras and enforcement. But the dead do not hear talk. They do not see the press releases. In April, a man lay in the street after a road rage assault. An ambulance struck him as he waited for help. The news <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>reported</a> it: “Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street.”</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> They have not done it here.

The bill, discussed in multiple legislative hearings since December, would require used car dealers to display at least five vehicles and limit temp tag issuance to 50 per year unless substantial business is proven. Brokers must hold Georgia licenses and show five sales yearly. The Department of Revenue could suspend or revoke dealer access for violations. The bill follows a Streetsblog probe exposing how weak Georgia rules fuel a black market for temp tags, endangering New York City streets. Councilman Oswald Feliz, who introduced two related NYC bills, calls this a 'big priority,' saying, 'We must use all tools to deter this reckless conduct.' The legislation’s summary states it will create or increase fines for those selling or driving with fraudulent tags. Industry groups say they want loopholes closed without hurting legitimate dealers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill was discussed at a City Council hearing on February 1, 2024. The Adams administration, represented by DOT officials Margaret Forgione and Will Carry, voiced strong support, citing 'public safety risks posed by growing risks of uncertified e-bike batteries.' The bill aims to help delivery workers transition to legal, safe devices and address both street and fire safety. Last year, 18 people died in 268 lithium-ion battery fires. Delivery companies like Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub oppose the bill, claiming it could lead to fraud and fail to solve the battery crisis. Workers' advocates back the bill but demand protections against retaliation, noting certified batteries are expensive and scarce.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan promised faster commutes for tens of thousands. Instead, Feliz and Bronx power brokers pushed a weak compromise: repainting the lane and expanding bus lane cameras. The matter summary states, 'Feliz has been a staunch opponent of the Department of Transportation's plan to improve the existing Fordham Road bus lane.' Feliz’s Honda Accord was cited three times for bus lane violations, including twice on Fordham Road, and six times for speeding in school zones since 2020. He claimed the car was 'shared.' Bus speeds barely improved, rising from 6 to 6.3 mph—still below the Bronx average. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain at risk.

The law, championed by then-Speaker Corey Johnson, aimed for safer, more equitable streets. Key projects, including bike lanes on McGuinness Boulevard and Ashland Place, and bus lanes on Fordham Road, were stalled or abandoned. The Department of Transportation blamed staff shortages and budget cuts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and other members voiced frustration but admitted limited power to enforce compliance. Council Member Chi Ossé was mentioned in coverage. Without mayoral commitment, the plan’s promise to protect vulnerable road users remains unfulfilled.

The law aims to protect delivery workers and consumers from battery fires. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Marjorie Velazquez back new bills requiring app-based delivery companies to provide safe e-bikes and batteries. Velazquez called the bill a 'key' step for safety. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project testified that certified batteries are too expensive and in short supply. Delivery workers, facing high costs and legal threats, often keep using unsafe batteries or turn to gas-powered mopeds. App companies resist, citing worker status and costs. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection has started enforcement, but the core danger persists: safe batteries are out of reach for many, leaving workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
