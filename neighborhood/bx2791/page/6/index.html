Five hundred five injured.</strong> In Bronx Park, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers pile up like wreckage. One serious injury after another. One death, then another. The youngest hurt was a child. The oldest, a senior. <strong>No one is spared.</strong></p><p>A 30-year-old man was crushed by a sedan on the Bronx River Parkway. A moped driver, age 27, ejected and killed. Another driver, 42, dead behind the wheel.

They talk about cameras and enforcement. But the dead do not hear talk. They do not see the press releases. In April, a man lay in the street after a road rage assault. An ambulance struck him as he waited for help. The news <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>reported</a> it: “Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street.”</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> They have not done it here. Cameras could be everywhere, but Albany drags its feet. Each day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These deaths are not the weather. They are the result of choices. Choices made by leaders who wait, who stall, who say the right words and do too little. The numbers will rise until the choices change.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They claim the changes will hurt traffic and business. Data shows most shoppers arrive by transit, walking, or biking—not by car. The city weighs next steps.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2023, Bronx business leaders and institutions sent a letter opposing the Department of Transportation’s plan to expand bus lanes on Fordham Road. The matter, titled 'Bronx Business Leaders and Local Institutions Want to Halt Bus Fixes on Fordham Rd,' highlights their demand for Mayor Adams to halt improvements meant for 85,000 daily bus riders. The Belmont and Fordham Business Improvement Districts, along with the Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Garden, Fordham University, Monroe College, and St. Barnabas Hospital, argue the changes would 'significantly impact crucial traffic flow' and burden side streets. State Sen. Gustavo Rivera voiced support for transit equity but awaits a traffic study. DOT claims to work with the community. Despite business concerns, advocates and city data show most shoppers use transit, walking, or biking, not cars. Similar fears about bus improvements hurting business have not come true elsewhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New Jersey Assembly Member Paul Moriarty called the findings "disturbing" and is drafting a bill to raise fines and consider criminal penalties for dealers. Assembly Member Clinton Calabrese is working with state agencies to fix regulatory gaps. In Georgia, Rep. John Corbett, chair of the Motor Vehicles Committee, plans to introduce legislation, while Sen. Josh McLaurin urges stronger regulatory enforcement to block bad actors. Sen. Sonya Halpern called Georgia's role in the black market "concerning." The matter centers on the illegal sale and use of temp tags, which, as safe streets advocate Jimmy Lee warns, embolden reckless drivers and make streets more dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.

The bills aimed to stop deadly fires without punishing those who rely on e-bikes to survive.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, the New York City Council advanced a package of lithium-ion battery safety bills. Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report covers July through October 2022 and cites 'fewer contractors available, shortages in installation materials, and general political opposition' as reasons for a 42% drop in bike lane miles and a 47% drop in bus lane miles compared to the previous year. Streetsblog’s coverage, criticized by City Hall and DOT, revealed that vacancies and political interference—especially from Council Members Bob Holden and Oswald Feliz—stalled projects like the Citi Bike expansion in Queens and the Fordham Road bus lane in the Bronx. DOT completed only 67% of its bus lane mandate and fell 17% short on bike lanes. The city’s own numbers now confirm what advocates warned: delays and obstruction put vulnerable road users in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation failed to build the 30 miles of protected bike lanes and 20 miles of bus lanes required by law. The agency scaled back busway hours on Jamaica Avenue and 181st Street after local pushback. Council Member Oswald Feliz opposed Fordham Road improvements, calling them an 'existential threat.' Queens Council Member Julie Won labeled Queensboro Bridge delays 'garbage.' The DOT removed protected bike lanes during Fourth Avenue construction, endangering cyclists. The Central Park Conservancy stalled on safety studies. Canal Street and Ocean Parkway saw little progress. The report states: 'city agencies failing to prioritize or deliver on street safety and sustainable transportation commitments.'
