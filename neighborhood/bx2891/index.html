Eighty-three injured. One left with life-altering wounds.</strong> That is the count in Pelham Bay Park over the last year alone. These are not just numbers. They are fathers, mothers, sons, daughters—people who left home and did not return the same.</p><p>Crashes come steady as rain. In the last twelve months, there were <strong>95 crashes</strong> in this small corner of the Bronx. The deadliest was a 42-year-old, killed behind the wheel on Pelham Parkway this April. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The data does not give his name</a>. It only says: apparent death. Lap belt and harness. Ford SUV. Night fell. He did not come home.</p><p><strong>Injuries cut across every age.</strong> Children, teens, the old. No one is spared. In the last year, two children under 18 were hurt. Twenty-one people aged 45 to 54. The violence is not random. It is relentless.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The city has expanded speed cameras and redesigned intersections. But in Pelham Bay Park, the carnage continues. The numbers do not show a sharp drop. They show a steady drip of blood.</p><p><strong>No public statements. No bold new plans.</strong> The silence is loud. The law gives power, but power unused is no power at all. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> It is policy. It is choice. The city can lower speeds. The city can harden crossings. The city can flood the streets with cameras that never blink. But only if leaders act.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The endorsement, reported by Streetsblog NYC and covered by Gersh Kuntzman, followed a review of candidate plans. StreetsPAC called Lander’s proposal 'by far the most comprehensive blueprint ... we've ever seen from a candidate for any office.' Lander promised more protected bike lanes, a citywide Bus Rapid Transit network, and using congestion pricing revenue for busways and bikeways. He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users.

The bill requires drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red-light camera tickets in twelve months, to install intelligent speed assistance devices. Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes led the push, joined by co-sponsors Samra Brouk, Cordell Cleare, and others. The vote passed with support from senators including Jeremy Cooney, Pete Harckham, and Jessica Ramos. The measure aims to rein in repeat offenders and reduce deadly speeding. The bill’s language is blunt: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.'
