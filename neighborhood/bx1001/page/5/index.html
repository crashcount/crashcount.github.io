No more hiding the gaps.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1164-2023, now enacted, amends the city code to require an 'investment roadmap' in every Streets Master Plan starting December 1, 2026. The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passing on October 19, 2023, and became law on November 19, 2023. The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C. Riley (primary), with Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Hanif, Brewer, Restler, and Rivera as co-sponsors, the bill demands DOT report, by neighborhood, on safety infrastructure investment, crash rates, and demographics. It shines a light on which districts get safety upgrades and which are left exposed. The roadmap aims to close the gap for underserved areas, forcing transparency and accountability for every dollar spent on street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Carr, the measure required DOT to install raised speed reducers within a year where feasible, then report annually on danger indicators and recommend if cameras should remain. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No raised speed reducers will be installed under this law.

The initiative, not tied to a specific bill number, follows a 2021 law requiring DOT to consider public feedback when creating new loading zones. The portal lets users pinpoint and describe street obstructions. Councilmember Amanda Farías of District 18, who is mentioned in connection with the launch, stated, 'Double-parking is a chronic issue throughout our city, and is one of the largest quality of life issues facing my district everyday.' She added, 'It is not only illegal to double-park your car, but it puts others in danger when neighbors are unable to cross traffic safely, congestion is added to our streets, crossways and bike lanes are blocked, and emergency vehicles cannot respond in time.' The portal aims to collect data on dangerous spots, focusing city attention on hazards that threaten pedestrians, cyclists, and emergency response.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
