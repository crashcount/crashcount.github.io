An 83-year-old crushed by a truck turning left on 2nd Avenue. Cyclists thrown and bleeding on the pavement. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person killed, five seriously injured, 196 hurt</strong> in 314 crashes in East Midtown-Turtle Bay. The dead are mostly old. The injured, every age.

Trucks and buses caused three serious injuries. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the weight of steel and speed of engines do most of the harm. The street is a gauntlet. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city boasts of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit stands, unchanged, while leaders wait. Speed cameras slash speeding by 63% where installed, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring. Promises are made. Streets remain the same. The city says one death is too many, but the numbers do not lie. <a href=../../take_action/>demand action</a></p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>One death. Five lives changed forever.</strong> Hundreds more scarred. Each crash is a choice, not fate. Each delay is a risk. The city can act. The council can vote. The mayor can sign. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

The review, published December 23, 2024, highlights congestion pricing delays, e-vehicle crackdowns, and increased subway enforcement. The matter notes, 'parents in [Powers'] Manhattan district felt slighted that their kids were left out of the free transportation program.' Powers pressed for fair access, saying, 'we're still hearing from families whose children aren't receiving an OMNY card like their classmates.' Council Member Robert Holden pushed for e-bike licensing, drawing fire from advocates. The review documents a year of policy shifts, enforcement surges, and ongoing fights over who gets safe, affordable transit.

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

The bill, debated on December 12, 2024, sits before the City Council. It would require all e-mobility devices not covered by the state DMV to register with the city’s Department of Transportation. The bill’s summary states it aims to increase accountability for e-bike riders after fatal crashes. Holden, the sponsor, cited dangers from unregulated e-vehicles and hit-and-runs. Advocacy groups, including Los Deliveristas Unidos and Open Plans, argue the bill would unfairly criminalize immigrants and delivery workers, and increase police stops for people of color. The NYC Hospitality Alliance warns of new financial and administrative burdens for small businesses. Both sides agree cars cause far more deaths, but the bill’s critics say better street design, not registration, would protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The $150 million plan, as described by Madelyn Wils, will reduce traffic lanes from five to three and widen sidewalks between Bryant Park and Central Park.

The bill is under council review as of December 10, 2024. The measure seeks to overhaul regulations that force NYCHA to keep up over 400 sidewalk sheds—spanning 25 miles—often long after repairs finish. The matter summary states, 'reforming parts of the city’s broader shedding regulations that are a poor fit for NYCHA and a nuisance citywide.' Powers and co-sponsor Erik Bottcher aim to reduce shed length, extend inspection cycles, and allow more art and color on scaffolds. Jamie Rubin, NYCHA board head, supports the bill, noting that current rules rob residents of sunlight, safety, and outdoor space.

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike. The bill has not yet received a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On December 4, 2024, the Adams administration cut the Fifth Avenue holiday Open Street program in Midtown from three Sundays to just one, shrinking the car-free zone to December 8 between 48th and 55th streets. The Fifth Avenue Association blamed security around Trump Tower. The matter summary reads: 'City scales back hugely popular Fifth Ave. Holiday Open Street despite sales boosts.' Council Member Keith Powers called the move 'surprising' and urged a full return next year. Advocates called it 'frustrating and disappointing.' Mayor Adams had previously praised the program, which boosted sales by $3 million in 2023. The Department of Transportation now touts sidewalk expansion, but the new redesign drops a planned bike lane and may slow buses. Pedestrians and cyclists lose space. The city’s retreat keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
