An 83-year-old crushed by a truck turning left on 2nd Avenue. Cyclists thrown and bleeding on the pavement. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person killed, five seriously injured, 196 hurt</strong> in 314 crashes in East Midtown-Turtle Bay. The dead are mostly old. The injured, every age.

Trucks and buses caused three serious injuries. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the weight of steel and speed of engines do most of the harm. The street is a gauntlet. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city boasts of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit stands, unchanged, while leaders wait. Speed cameras slash speeding by 63% where installed, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring. Promises are made. Streets remain the same. The city says one death is too many, but the numbers do not lie. <a href=../../take_action/>demand action</a></p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>One death. Five lives changed forever.</strong> Hundreds more scarred. Each crash is a choice, not fate. Each delay is a risk. The city can act. The council can vote. The mayor can sign. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter.

The plan, to be presented to community boards, would restrict through car traffic between Third and Ninth avenues, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter aims to address congestion and slow bus speeds on the M34, where buses average five to seven miles per hour. Council Member Keith Powers, who rides the route daily, said, "If you dedicate a big chunk of a corridor to bus service, you will see strong results." Powers and community leaders support the move, citing the 14th Street busway’s success: a 24 percent speed boost and 30 percent ridership jump. The proposal follows years of planning and comes as congestion pricing looms. Some advocates remain wary, recalling Mayor Adams’s past delays and reduced busway hours. The city faces pressure to make the busway permanent and effective for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable users watch.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the Adams administration's move to open a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge. The event, not a council bill but a city action, drew sharp criticism from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who opposed removing a vehicle lane for pedestrians and cyclists. The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.' Still, the move restores space to those on foot and bike, challenging car dominance and federal resistance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists chased the horse, warning others. The horse was not tethered to a hitching post, as none was nearby. Christina Hansen, union rep for carriage horses, stated, "There were no injuries or property damage reported, and there's currently no indication the horse's driver was negligent." The incident highlights gaps in securing procedures and the absence of hitching posts, raising questions about safety for pedestrians and park users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays.
