An 83-year-old crushed by a truck turning left on 2nd Avenue. Cyclists thrown and bleeding on the pavement. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person killed, five seriously injured, 196 hurt</strong> in 314 crashes in East Midtown-Turtle Bay. The dead are mostly old. The injured, every age.

Trucks and buses caused three serious injuries. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the weight of steel and speed of engines do most of the harm. The street is a gauntlet. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city boasts of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit stands, unchanged, while leaders wait. Speed cameras slash speeding by 63% where installed, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring. Promises are made. Streets remain the same. The city says one death is too many, but the numbers do not lie. <a href=../../take_action/>demand action</a></p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>One death. Five lives changed forever.</strong> Hundreds more scarred. Each crash is a choice, not fate. Each delay is a risk. The city can act. The council can vote. The mayor can sign. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

Council Member Diana I. Ayala is the primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors including De La Rosa, Banks, Ossé, Marte, and others. The bill was laid over by committee on February 10, 2025. The measure would take effect immediately if passed.

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.

The hearing, covered by Councilmember Keith Powers (District 4), focused on Mastro’s promise to recuse himself from major cases involving former clients, including lawsuits against Local Law 97, rent regulations, and congestion pricing. The matter summary states Mastro would step aside from any city-related case, even if the city is not a direct party. Powers pressed Mastro on whether a top attorney with so many conflicts could serve the city’s interests. Mastro insisted his experience makes him fit for the role, while Adams praised his record but acknowledged the council’s authority to confirm. No formal safety analysis was provided regarding impacts on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lot, closed for years during flood wall construction, reopened for parking despite calls for change. The matter summary reads: 'An underused parking lot below the FDR Drive should finally turn into a community space instead of car storage, according to residents and politicians.' Sandy McKee, CB6 chair, said, 'If we took away the cars, it would be a visible connection through to the waterfront.' Powers backed the move, stressing the need for public access. The board sent a resolution to the Economic Development Corporation. The city claims it still needs the space for construction and right-of-way management. No formal bill number or committee is listed. The push echoes similar highway conversions in Toronto and Brooklyn.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jeremy Cooney, new chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, issued a public demand for Governor Hochul to deliver a '100-day plan' to replace the $16.5 billion MTA funding shortfall caused by her cancellation of congestion pricing. In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of funding jeopardizes projects vital to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move aims to stop deadly basement charging and bring safety to delivery workers. A new battery trade-in program will target dangerous lithium-ion batteries and mopeds. Community resistance remains.</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a new initiative to permit private sidewalk e-bike and moped charging stations. The program, previewed at a press conference with Mayor Adams, will open for applications by year’s end after a public hearing on August 21. The matter, described as making it 'easier and faster for property owners to install public battery charging and swapping cabinets,' seeks to replace illegal, hazardous charging hubs with regulated infrastructure. Council Member Keith Powers, who sponsored last year’s battery trade-in law, said, 'No one wants to use—or be anywhere near—batteries that aren't safe to charge.' Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh called current illegal charging 'effectively death traps.' The city will also fund a $2 million battery and moped trade-in program. Delivery worker advocates want the new stations to be free or low-cost. Community board opposition has slowed previous efforts. The mayor remains neutral on state e-bike registration proposals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers say this closes loopholes, shifts blame from workers, and aims to cut rising crashes. Streets see more mopeds, more injuries, more tension.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2024, Governor Hochul signed a package of eight bills into law, including new moped and e-bike safety regulations. The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative states, 'A Jeep kept south. A man on a bike fell hard. Blood pooled near his torn leg. His foot split open. No helmet. No damage to the Jeep. Just pain on the pavement.' The report lists the cyclist as injured, suffering 'severe lacerations,' and notes that the SUV sustained no damage. Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead at the time of the crash. The police report does not specify any driver errors or contributing factors beyond 'Unspecified.' The only detail about the cyclist’s behavior is the absence of a helmet, which is mentioned in the narrative but not cited as a contributing factor.

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected. No formal safety analysis was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
