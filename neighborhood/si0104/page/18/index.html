In the last twelve months, 123 people were hurt in crashes across West New Brighton-Silver Lake-Grymes Hill. One was left with injuries so severe they may never heal. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A 14-year-old bled from the head after a crash at Forest Avenue and Victory Boulevard. A cyclist, age 28, thrown and bleeding on Brighton Avenue. These are not numbers. They are lives split open by steel and speed.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-harm>The Machines That Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In this district, they caused 1 death and 51 injuries to pedestrians since 2022. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes and mopeds—none. The pattern is clear. The danger comes heavy and fast, from behind a windshield. The city’s own data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>shows it</a>. There is no mystery here. &ldquo;Driver inattention/distraction&rdquo; was the cause when an 82-year-old woman was killed crossing Bard Avenue at Forest Avenue.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-evasion>Leadership: Action and Evasion</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have failed to act with urgency.</strong> Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo and State Senator Andrew Lanza both voted against extending school speed zones, turning their backs on the most basic protection for children. Pirozzolo also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>opposed the city&rsquo;s speed camera program</a>, a tool proven to save lives. Their votes are on the record. The silence is louder than the crash. The system investigates, but the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward>The Path Forward</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every injury, every death, could have been stopped. Lower the speed limit. Expand camera enforcement. Redesign the streets so mistakes do not kill. Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for another child’s blood on the asphalt.</p><p><strong>Contact your leaders. Demand safer streets.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Danielle Arigoni, managing director at the National Housing Trust, discussed her book, 'Climate Resilience for an Aging Nation.' She said, 'time and time again, older adults are the majority of deaths in disasters.' The episode detailed how, from Hurricane Katrina to the Lahaina wildfires, seniors bear the brunt of heat, floods, and storms. Host Jeff Wood pressed on the need for policy that protects the vulnerable. The discussion made clear: the system ignores the predictable, mounting toll on older adults. No council bill or vote was involved, but the call for action was urgent. The city cannot keep looking away.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, which was supposed to upgrade a painted lane to a parking-protected lane, has been pushed to at least next spring. Ossé wrote to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, calling the delay 'unacceptable' and demanding a firm installation date. He stated, 'The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.' Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, echoed his frustration, citing record cyclist deaths and urgent need for safety. The DOT has not responded to requests for comment. The delay highlights the city’s repeated failures to deliver promised street safety improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In a closed-door meeting with the Department of Transportation, Adams said, "My legacy is not how many bike miles I do. My legacy is not how many bus lanes I do." He signaled a shift from measurable safety benchmarks to a focus on community input, a move DOT staffers called "extremely micromanaged." Adams’s administration has failed to meet even the minimum legal standards for new lanes. A mayoral spokesman claimed the city still delivers "safe, efficient streets," but advocates say Adams’s approach relies on vague metrics and lacks accountability. No council members are directly involved; this is a mayoral policy stance. The result: fewer protected spaces for vulnerable road users, more risk on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He says communities need more input. Advocates warn this lets small groups block life-saving changes. The city falls behind on safety targets. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On October 17, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams made a public statement criticizing the Department of Transportation’s community outreach for street redesigns. No council bill number applies; this is a mayoral policy stance. Adams said, “We have not done a good job of speaking to long-term residents on how they want the shaping of their streets to change.” He announced a new door-to-door engagement strategy on Underhill Avenue, after stalling a bike network project for over a year. Adams’s comments came as he defended delays and rollbacks of approved street safety improvements, citing the need for more community input. Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Juan Restrepo (Transportation Alternatives) condemned the mayor’s approach, warning it gives veto power to small groups and leaves the city “rudderless” on street safety. DOT outreach has dropped to its lowest since Vision Zero began. The city is on pace to miss its bike and bus lane goals for the second year running. Vulnerable road users face continued danger as life-saving projects stall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) leads the rollout. The plan covers about 41% of city housing. The official summary states, 'New Yorkers living in smaller residential buildings will have to set out their garbage in lidded bins.' DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended sidewalk placement, saying, 'It is standard practice around the world to put wheelie bins out on the sidewalk rather than in the parking lane.' Advocate Christine Berthet countered, 'While the bags will be easy to move between cars, containers will be much harder. And therefore having them in the parking lane would be a major benefit.' The city will retrofit trucks for the new bins. For now, pedestrians must still navigate bins on crowded sidewalks. The curb stays reserved for parked cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, unveiled by DSNY, aims to move trash from sidewalks into closed bins, targeting cleaner streets and less sidewalk clutter. The mayor said, 'Everyday New Yorkers are tired of the rodents, they’re tired of the trash, and this is a small price to pay on ensuring that you can have cleaner streets.' Council member Shaun Abreu, representing West Harlem, voiced strong support, citing visible improvements from the local pilot. The plan requires smaller buildings to use wheeled bins on sidewalks, while larger buildings would get shared curbside containers. The city faces pushback from some residents, but Adams insists street cleanliness is a top concern. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the move could clear sidewalks for pedestrians and reduce hazards from trash piles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in October 2023, has not specified a streamlined process for licensing. The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy.

The suit targets retaliation against civilians reporting traffic misconduct.</p><p class=mb3>On September 19, 2023, attorney Adam White filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD, seven officers, and the City of New York. The case stems from a November 11, 2022 arrest after White removed a plastic cover from a license plate he believed was obscured to dodge traffic cameras. The complaint, citing false arrest and retaliation, states: "Mr. White now brings this suit seeking redress for the violations of his own rights, as well as seeking changes to Defendant City's policies and practices around responding appropriately, and without retaliation, to civilian complaints about illegal 'ghost cars,' 'ghost plates,' and other traffic misconduct." The suit names Sholem Klein, head of the Rockaway Nassau Safety Patrol, as the complainant who called police. The Brooklyn DA later dropped charges against White. The lawsuit seeks damages and policy reforms to protect civilians who report illegal traffic activity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Officials dodged questions. Council grilled DOT. Advocates tracked the shortfall. Political meddling blocks safer streets. Vulnerable New Yorkers wait. Progress stalls. Danger stays.</p><p class=mb3>On September 13, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on the Department of Transportation’s progress toward mandated bus and bike lane construction. The hearing, led by Transportation Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for answers. The law requires 150 miles of protected bus lanes and 250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026. In 2022, the city built only 4.4 miles of bus lanes and 26.3 miles of bike lanes, far short of the legal benchmarks. Councilmember Lincoln Restler criticized political interference, saying, 'We're at a point where it's all politics all the time, and we're failing to execute.' Advocacy groups confirmed the city lags behind. The administration’s refusal to track or disclose progress leaves vulnerable road users exposed. The city’s failure to act keeps streets dangerous.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing, led by the Committee on Transportation, featured testimony from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and others criticized the agency for 'continuously falling behind on legally required bus and bike lanes.' The matter title reads: 'NYC Council members slam Transportation Department on bus, bike lane backlog.' Restler’s action was to publicly challenge DOT’s delays.
