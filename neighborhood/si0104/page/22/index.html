Three left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In the last three years, the streets of West New Brighton-Silver Lake-Grymes Hill have not been quiet. There have been <strong>798 crashes</strong> since 2022. <strong>368 people hurt.</strong> The dead do not speak. The injured carry scars.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A woman, 82, struck and killed while crossing Bard Avenue. The driver was not paying attention. The police found her unconscious, head injuries too severe. She died at the intersection. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash report lists the cause as driver inattention</a>.</p><p>A man, 58, crossing Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him. The impact threw the rider. Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca never made it home. &ldquo;Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>police told reporters</a>. No arrests. No answers.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They talk about safety.</strong> But the numbers do not move fast enough. The city has added protected bike lanes and lowered speed limits in some places. But on these streets, the danger remains. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm.</strong> Speed cameras work, but only if they are turned on and the law is enforced. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets where children and elders can cross without fear. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article states: 'New York State residents continued to drive heavily despite high gas prices, with fuel consumption increasing from March to May 2022.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance slams the tax holiday as 'an outrageous windfall for oil profiteers' and warns it deprives New Yorkers of essential services. The article ties increased driving to sprawl and transit neglect, noting, 'Decades of sprawl planning and disinvestment in transit has made it more difficult to get around without a car—at a cost of our lungs, our bodies and our planet.' The surge in driving means more road deaths, more congestion, and more pollution.

The project, part of the Streets Master Plan, faces committee review and community outreach through summer and fall, with implementation not expected before 2023. DOT Director of Bus Priority Kyle Gebhart said, “Everything is on the table.” The agency’s data shows slow buses and high rates of pedestrian and cyclist injuries. The plan divides the corridor into three segments for tailored solutions, including curbside and center-running bus lanes, transit signal priority, and busways. Some business groups voiced anger over possible parking loss, but transit advocates countered that most shoppers do not drive. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein said, “Busways are great for business, bringing more customers from more neighborhoods more efficiently and affordably.” The project’s outcome will shape safety for thousands who walk, bike, and ride.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'Testing a rat-proof trash container... instead of on the sidewalk.' Council Member Erik Bottcher said he is 'thrilled that our district was the first to be chosen for this exciting advance,' calling it 'another important step.' The pilot takes parking space for bins, sparking complaints from drivers but clearing pedestrian paths. The city plans to expand the $1.3-million program to all five boroughs.

The matter highlights that 'Staten Island has the city's lowest rate of Service Delivered.' Riders like Kayla and Brandon Grada spoke of constant cancellations and unreliable schedules. Janno Lieber, MTA Chairman and CEO, said hiring is underway to address the shortage. Staten Island’s service delivery rate was 92 percent in April, compared to 97 percent citywide. The MTA’s hiring freeze and pandemic losses hit Staten Island hardest. Riders report missed work and abandoning transit. The MTA promises improvement, but for now, vulnerable road users face longer waits and greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Traffic violence has a price NYC cannot afford.' The NYPD, Department of Sanitation, FDNY, Department of Environmental Protection, and DOT accounted for nearly all payouts.

Speaking publicly, Lieber said, "If it doesn't happen, at some point we can't award contracts that are dependent on having capital, the cash a couple of years later." The matter centers on congestion pricing, which Lieber and advocates call the largest, most environmentally beneficial funding source for the MTA. Projects at risk include the Second Avenue Subway, ADA accessibility improvements, and zero-emissions buses. Lieber opposes broad exemptions, arguing carve-outs weaken the plan. Rachel Fauss, a transit advocate, stressed, "There is no other source to fill that $15 billion hole."

The study tracked 4,000 urban residents across Europe, showing daily cyclists had 84% lower travel emissions than non-cyclists.
