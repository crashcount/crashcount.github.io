Three left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In the last three years, the streets of West New Brighton-Silver Lake-Grymes Hill have not been quiet. There have been <strong>798 crashes</strong> since 2022. <strong>368 people hurt.</strong> The dead do not speak. The injured carry scars.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A woman, 82, struck and killed while crossing Bard Avenue. The driver was not paying attention. The police found her unconscious, head injuries too severe. She died at the intersection. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash report lists the cause as driver inattention</a>.</p><p>A man, 58, crossing Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him. The impact threw the rider. Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca never made it home. &ldquo;Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>police told reporters</a>. No arrests. No answers.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They talk about safety.</strong> But the numbers do not move fast enough. The city has added protected bike lanes and lowered speed limits in some places. But on these streets, the danger remains. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm.</strong> Speed cameras work, but only if they are turned on and the law is enforced. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets where children and elders can cross without fear. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill required the NYPD to run tow pound facilities with enough capacity to deter illegal parking and traffic violations. It also mandated annual public reports on tow pound use and enforcement, disaggregated by precinct. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department tow pound capacity.' Council Members Kamillah Hanks (primary sponsor), Oswald Feliz, Sandra Ung, Lincoln Restler, Shaun Abreu, Farah N. Louis, Mercedes Narcisse, and Amanda Farías sponsored the bill. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. No safety analyst assessed the impact for vulnerable road users. The city’s failure to expand towing leaves illegal cars on sidewalks and crosswalks. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable commuters wait.</p><p class=mb3>On July 20, 2023, the MTA called on Mayor Eric Adams and the Department of Transportation (DOT) to support renewed bus lane expansion on Fordham Road. The city had canceled a planned busway after pushback from business owners and Council Member Oswald Feliz, who remains a vocal critic. MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey said, "Our hope is that we DOT stays with us and we're implementing this, hopefully, later this year." MTA CEO Janno Lieber stressed, "We can't deemphasize and under-prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx and also Upper Manhattan who are trying to get east and west across this incredibly busy corridor." DOT spokesperson Vin Barone described a new proposal with dedicated curbside loading and minimal traffic diversions. The city’s earlier pledge for 20 new miles of bus lanes per year has not been met. Eighty-five thousand daily bus riders, many vulnerable, remain at risk on slow, crowded streets. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Yet their state rakes in billions from MTA contracts. The plan will raise $15 billion for transit. Jersey firms stand to gain more. Lawsuits loom. Money and politics collide. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2023, a report surfaced in Streetsblog NYC detailing the debate over MTA congestion pricing. The report, titled "New Jersey May See Red over Congestion Pricing, but Garden State Gets Plenty of MTA Green," highlights that from 2014 to 2022, the MTA paid New Jersey companies $3.3 billion for goods and services. The plan, set to raise $15 billion for the MTA's 2020-2024 capital plan, faces opposition from New Jersey officials, including Governor Phil Murphy, who have threatened lawsuits. The article quotes Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany: "Congestion pricing will bring in $15 billion alone for the MTA's $55 billion 2020-2024 capital plan, and New Jersey businesses stand to profit from this major increase in MTA capital spending." MTA spokesperson Eugene Resnick adds that congestion pricing will "reduce traffic, improve regional air quality, and boost the Garden State's economy." Despite the political fight, the money keeps flowing. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the system prioritizes contracts and capital over street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Connections to the ferry and boardwalk improved.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2023, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) marked the completion of a major infrastructure project in Rockaway. The work, running from Beach Channel Drive to Shore Front Parkway, added porous pavement, new bike lanes, and wider pedestrian walkways. The city says the 11,000 square feet of new surface can absorb nearly 1.3 million gallons of stormwater each year. Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes. The changes give cyclists and pedestrians an easier, safer route to the Rockaway ferry terminal and boardwalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article argues, ‘SUVs, pick-up trucks, and passenger cars should not be the benchmark by which we judge the size of other forms of transit, and the term 'micromobility' encourages us to believe that they are.’ Author Sarah Risser calls for dropping the ‘micro’ prefix, urging us to see bikes and scooters as standard, not lesser. She highlights how oversized vehicles—cars, SUVs, trucks—fuel rising deaths among pedestrians and cyclists. Risser urges language that centers human-scaled mobility and rejects car supremacy.

Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, voiced concern about the delay and the city’s ability to finish the project. Community Visioning Council members were not told in advance.

In a letter, Hoylman-Sigal wrote, "We urge you to create a unified payment system as expeditiously as possible." The proposal aims to remove barriers for would-be Citi Bike users and address issues like vandalized QR codes. The bill is a policy proposal, not yet in committee or up for a vote. Hoylman-Sigal’s push highlights the fractured nature of New York’s fare systems, with separate payments for subways, bikes, ferries, and regional trains. While OMNY integration could streamline access, technical and financial hurdles remain. The MTA and Cubic, OMNY’s contractor, say they are reviewing expansion opportunities.

Family and advocates say the plan skips key safety fixes. Jersey barriers leave gaps. Pedestrian islands and bike signals are missing. The city delays. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) latest redesign proposal for Ninth Street in Gowanus drew fire at a Community Board 6 meeting. The plan, discussed in the Transportation and Public Safety Committees, adds buffer-protected bike lanes and some jersey barriers, but skips driveways and omits pedestrian islands, raised intersections, and bicycle signals. Maxime Le Munier, whose wife Sarah Schick was killed by a truck driver on Ninth Street, said, “What we want is to guarantee everyone’s safety, and it seems like it’s going to fall short.” Community Board 6 Transportation Chair Doug Gordon and Public Safety Chair Jerry Armer echoed calls for stronger, faster action. Council Member Hanif hosted a recent event on the issue. The committees unanimously approved the DOT proposal with conditions: more pedestrian safety, more traffic calming, and a comprehensive plan for all of Ninth Street. DOT has not set a timeline. Schick’s family is suing the city for $100 million, alleging negligence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden with co-sponsors including Ariola, Riley, Yeger, Restler, Brooks-Powers, Hanks, Borelli, Carr, Kagan, Vernikov, and Paladino. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects. While it aims to protect emergency access, advocates warn it could delay or block street redesigns that save lives for people walking and biking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
