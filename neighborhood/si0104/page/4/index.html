They talk about safety.</strong> But the numbers do not move fast enough. The city has added protected bike lanes and lowered speed limits in some places. But on these streets, the danger remains. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm.</strong> Speed cameras work, but only if they are turned on and the law is enforced. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets where children and elders can cross without fear. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city moves, but not all riders win.</p><p class=mb3>On April 26, 2024, New York State lawmakers approved over $12 million to increase bus service across New York City. The decision ended funding for the MTA's pilot program that made one bus route in each borough free. The matter, titled 'NYC to get a boost in bus service, but pilot program for free routes ends,' highlights the trade-off: more buses, but no more free rides. Councilmember Kamillah Hanks of District 49 introduced a resolution urging the MTA to install at least 30 OMNY card vending machines in every borough, noting not all riders can pay by smartphone. The bill is not tied to a specific council committee or number. Hanks is mentioned for her advocacy on OMNY access. The move increases bus frequency but leaves low-income and cash riders behind.

Introduced April 18, 2024, it calls on the MTA to 'ensure equitable distribution of OMNY vending machines in the five boroughs, including implementing such machines in at least 30 high-traffic areas in each borough.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, Kevin C. Riley, and Kamillah Hanks back the measure. The bill responds to gaps in OMNY machine rollout, especially on Staten Island, where most stations lack vending machines. Riders without contactless cards or devices face barriers. The council’s push aims to end the transit access gap and force the MTA to serve every borough, not just the busiest or wealthiest.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2024, Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (District 49) stood with Staten Island officials at a press conference to oppose New York’s congestion pricing plan. The event, covered by nypost.com, highlighted concerns that the $15 toll for driving south of 60th Street in Manhattan would, as Hanks said, 'have a negative impact in neighborhoods of color in the outer boroughs.' Hanks and others argued the plan would burden working residents and increase pollution in Staten Island’s minority communities. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s environmental assessment confirmed air quality could worsen in Staten Island, the Bronx, and New Jersey, even as it improves in Manhattan. The MTA pledged $130 million for clean-up, but local leaders remain unconvinced. Hanks’s opposition underscores the ongoing debate over who pays—and who suffers—when the city tries to curb car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One driver, unlicensed and traveling west in a 2004 sedan, contributed to the collision through unsafe speed and unsafe lane changing. The crash involved three vehicles: a sedan from Texas, and two New York-registered vehicles including a 2017 SUV and a 2019 sedan. The impact points included center front end, right front quarter panel, and left front bumper. Four male occupants, aged 24 to 33, suffered whiplash injuries to the neck and head, all conscious and restrained by lap belts and harnesses. The report highlights driver errors—unsafe speed and lane changing—as primary factors, with no contributing victim behaviors noted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Streets stay risky for those on foot or bike.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0099-2024, now laid over in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, would require the Department of Transportation to create curbside overnight parking for commercial vehicles in every Industrial Business Zone. The bill, introduced February 8, 2024, mandates that only commercial vehicles may park in these zones between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. The matter title states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the creation of curbside overnight truck parking sections in Industrial Business Zones.' Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), Nantasha M. Williams, Lincoln Restler, Farah N. Louis, Kevin C. Riley, and others back the measure. DOT must consult community boards and report annually on effectiveness. No safety analysis for vulnerable road users is available. The bill remains in committee, with no vote scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton (D-23) joined 17 other lawmakers in a lawsuit against the plan, which would charge drivers entering Midtown Manhattan. The editorial claims, 'solving [MTA fiscal problems] by punishing average New Yorkers simply for driving is insane,' and highlights concerns over economic burden. The piece quotes union leaders and lawmakers, including Scarcella-Spanton, City Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli, and US Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, all opposing the tolls. There is no assessment of the impact on vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, or transit riders. The focus remains on driver expenses and political backlash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA defends the plan, saying it funds safer, less crowded streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 4, 2024, Council Member Joseph C. Borelli (District 51) joined seventeen other lawmakers in a federal lawsuit to block New York City’s $15 congestion pricing toll for Midtown Manhattan. The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation. The case highlights the political and environmental battle over how to fund and shape New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
