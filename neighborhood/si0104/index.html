In the last twelve months, 123 people were hurt in crashes across West New Brighton-Silver Lake-Grymes Hill. One was left with injuries so severe they may never heal. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A 14-year-old bled from the head after a crash at Forest Avenue and Victory Boulevard. A cyclist, age 28, thrown and bleeding on Brighton Avenue. These are not numbers. They are lives split open by steel and speed.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-harm>The Machines That Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In this district, they caused 1 death and 51 injuries to pedestrians since 2022. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes and mopeds—none. The pattern is clear. The danger comes heavy and fast, from behind a windshield. The city’s own data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>shows it</a>. There is no mystery here. &ldquo;Driver inattention/distraction&rdquo; was the cause when an 82-year-old woman was killed crossing Bard Avenue at Forest Avenue.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-evasion>Leadership: Action and Evasion</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have failed to act with urgency.</strong> Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo and State Senator Andrew Lanza both voted against extending school speed zones, turning their backs on the most basic protection for children. Pirozzolo also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>opposed the city&rsquo;s speed camera program</a>, a tool proven to save lives. Their votes are on the record. The silence is louder than the crash. The system investigates, but the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward>The Path Forward</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every injury, every death, could have been stopped. Lower the speed limit. Expand camera enforcement. Redesign the streets so mistakes do not kill. Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for another child’s blood on the asphalt.</p><p><strong>Contact your leaders. Demand safer streets.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Reporter Kirstyn Brendlen covered the findings. No council members sponsored or voted, but the review shows the casino could bring thousands of cars daily.

Streets stay clogged. Pedestrians and bus riders lose. Car dominance remains. Safety and equity stalled.</p><p class=mb3>On July 3, 2025, the Adams administration paused the 34th Street busway project, as reported by Streetsblog NYC. The matter, described as a 'highly-anticipated 34th Street busway,' had support from Council Members Erik Bottcher, Keith Powers, and others. Bottcher called it 'transformative,' promising fewer crashes and faster buses. Powers slammed the last-minute reversal. Safety analysts warn: canceling the busway preserves car dominance, discourages transit, and keeps streets unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. The project’s future is uncertain. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
