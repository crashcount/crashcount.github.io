Three left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In the last three years, the streets of West New Brighton-Silver Lake-Grymes Hill have not been quiet. There have been <strong>798 crashes</strong> since 2022. <strong>368 people hurt.</strong> The dead do not speak. The injured carry scars.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A woman, 82, struck and killed while crossing Bard Avenue. The driver was not paying attention. The police found her unconscious, head injuries too severe. She died at the intersection. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash report lists the cause as driver inattention</a>.</p><p>A man, 58, crossing Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him. The impact threw the rider. Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca never made it home. &ldquo;Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>police told reporters</a>. No arrests. No answers.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They talk about safety.</strong> But the numbers do not move fast enough. The city has added protected bike lanes and lowered speed limits in some places. But on these streets, the danger remains. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm.</strong> Speed cameras work, but only if they are turned on and the law is enforced. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets where children and elders can cross without fear. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Bottcher called it 'transformative,' promising fewer crashes and faster buses. Powers slammed the last-minute reversal.

The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use.

The official matter: 'Part of the parking-protected bike lane on a hazardous stretch of Bedford Avenue ... will be removed and replaced with a non-protected painted bike lane.'

Transportation Alternatives noted pedestrian injuries fell 10% and driver injuries 42% after the lane was installed.

Mayor Eric Adams said over 100,000 'ghost vehicles' have been seized since 2022, including cars with fake or missing plates. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, 'This morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them.' The crackdown targets vehicles often used by delivery workers but also linked by officials to traffic violations and other offenses. A Citi Bike was destroyed among the pile, though officials did not explain why. The event highlighted ongoing enforcement actions and raised questions about policy impacts on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, who represent the corridor, both support the measure. The resolution urges the city to prioritize the busway, which would ban through traffic by private cars between Third and Ninth avenues. Leadership from Community Boards 4 and 5 also joined the call. DOT plans to implement the busway in summer or fall 2025.

DOT Project Manager Esteban Doyle said the plan reallocates space to match actual use. Community members praised the move. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not specify what design was implemented or how it affected pedestrians and cyclists, so no safety impact can be determined.'

The plan, supported by Council Members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, and Rita Joseph, aims to improve transit and pedestrian safety. The matter summary states: 'A proposed center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue... is being considered by the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) as a way to improve transit, calm traffic, and enhance pedestrian safety.' The project faces delays and political pushback, including the removal of a protected bike lane after developer objections. A safety analyst notes: 'Center-running bus lanes typically reduce conflicts between buses, cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, calm traffic, and can enable street redesigns that improve safety and comfort for vulnerable road users.' The DOT will present a detailed plan in the fall. The final decision rests with Mayor Adams.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch.
