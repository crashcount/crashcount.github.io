Advocates want more.</p><p class=mb3>On January 29, 2025, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso pressed the Department of Transportation to overhaul a six-lane stretch of Atlantic Avenue as part of a rezoning plan. Reynoso’s recommendations—outlined in his official statement—include a road diet, pedestrian and cyclist upgrades, and paid parking. He criticized DOT’s lack of detail, saying, 'Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum.' The Atlantic Avenue Mixed Use Plan, now heading to a Department of City Planning hearing, would rezone 13 blocks and remove parking minimums for new housing. Council Member Crystal Hudson acknowledged the community’s demand for safety but stopped short of backing a road diet. DOT has promised some safety tweaks—painted neckdowns, daylighting, planters, a new bike lane—but not a full redesign. Advocates and Transportation Alternatives call for protected bike lanes and pedestrian plazas. Reynoso’s push highlights the gap between incremental fixes and the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
