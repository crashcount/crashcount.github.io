The Department of Transportation (DOT) postponed its presentation on making the open street permanent after Hudson raised concerns. The matter summary states: 'implementation – especially the 'Limited Local Access' model – and communication... has been flawed.' Hudson, who has supported open space and pedestrian safety, now emphasizes community engagement, saying, 'Every voice, including dissenting voices, must be heard.' She suggests changes to better accommodate all residents. Data shows the open street is safer, with fewer crashes and more non-drivers using the space. Hudson’s stance highlights the tension between safety gains and demands for broader consensus.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The councilmembers cited ongoing crashes, injuries, and community complaints about dangerous conditions. They requested a comprehensive traffic study and highlighted support from over 2,000 neighbors and local advocacy groups. DOT responded that it would review the letter and meet with the community.

The matter, described as a 'police-involved traffic fatality and official response,' has drawn sharp criticism. Julie Floyd, Smith’s sister, demands the officers be fired, stating, 'If one of us runs a red light... there's a risk of us getting shot.' Council Member Crystal Hudson echoed the call for termination. The NYPD has not commented, only placing the driver on modified duty. The state Attorney General’s office is also investigating, as required in police-involved deaths. Vehicle crashes, especially those involving NYPD, drive up city settlement costs.

The matter summary states, 'The police officer who was driving the NYPD vehicle that fatally struck a man...has been placed on modified duty.' The NYPD's lack of transparency is routine. Truths surface only after lawsuits. In 2020, vehicle crashes cost the city $142 million. Police settlements are a heavy burden.

She said, 'We cannot continue to approve things one by one, without any regard for the full context of the area.' Community Board 8 also objects, favoring a broader MCROWN rezoning. The Department of City Planning and DOT are reviewing the proposal, which has conditional approvals from the Borough President and City Planning. The developers argue their project could model safer, car-reducing development on a deadly corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution urged the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make bus and subway announcements in the four most commonly spoken languages in New York City. The official title: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make bus and subway announcements in the four most commonly spoken languages in New York City.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Sandra Ung, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Tiffany Cabán backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided, but the intent was clear: break the language barrier, reach millions of riders, and give all New Yorkers equal warning and access on transit. The MTA still makes most announcements in English only.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Barriers vanished without warning, then returned after public outcry. Councilmember Crystal Hudson stood firm. DOT cited rising crash deaths. Most neighbors backed the car-free stretch.</p><p class=mb3>On March 8, 2022, Councilmember Crystal Hudson hosted a heated debate on the Willoughby Avenue open street in District 35. The meeting followed the abrupt, unannounced removal of barriers from the eight-block stretch, which sparked swift backlash. Hudson, joined by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez, faced vocal opponents worried about lost parking and emergency access. Hudson said, 'This is about more than just open streets, this is about safe streets.' DOT surveys showed 88 percent support for permanent safety changes. Mayor Eric Adams ordered the street restored after learning Hudson opposed its closure. Rodríguez highlighted a spike in traffic deaths, noting, 'We have a responsibility to think about, first of all, protecting our senior citizens.' According to NYC Crash Mapper, 72 people—mostly cyclists and motorists—were injured on this stretch in the past decade, but no deaths. The open streets program, launched during the pandemic, remains popular and aims to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
