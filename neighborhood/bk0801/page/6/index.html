The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make bus and subway announcements in the four most commonly spoken languages in New York City.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Sandra Ung, Julie Won, and Crystal Hudson back the measure. The bill points to nearly two million New Yorkers with limited English proficiency. Today, MTA announcements are English only. The council’s action pushes for clear, multilingual communication so all riders—especially those most at risk—can understand vital transit information.

The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ in relation to allowing New York city to establish a lower speed limit, and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.'

The SAFE Streets Act targets reckless driving, demands safer street design, and gives crash victims more rights.

According to the police report, 'A Jeep rear-ended a diesel truck. The SUV’s front folded. The truck barely moved. An 88-year-old woman, belted in the front seat, died. Her body shattered inside the car. She never got out.' The crash killed the elderly front-seat passenger. The report lists 'Following Too Closely' as a contributing factor. The passenger was wearing a lap belt and harness. No driver errors by the truck operator are listed.

Parked cars choke corners. A child died. Locals demand action. Council Member Hudson calls for daylighting near schools. The mayor stalls. Crashes mount. Streets stay dangerous. Residents want the city to act now.</p><p class=mb3>On November 14, 2023, the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council released a survey showing none of the neighborhood’s 54 intersections meet state daylighting standards. The group, led by Gib Veconi, demands the Adams administration finish the Underhill Avenue bike boulevard and support the Vanderbilt Avenue open street. Council Member Crystal Hudson called for daylighting all intersections within a half-mile of a school, covering all 54 intersections. The matter summary states, 'No intersections in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, are clear of parked cars as required under state law.' Veconi and the council cite recent pedestrian deaths, including a 7-year-old killed by an NYPD tow truck driver whose view was blocked by parked cars. The mayor’s office has delayed safety projects, citing outreach concerns. Residents and advocates say the city’s exemption from state daylighting law leaves streets unsafe, with 180 crashes and 75 injuries reported this year. They urge City Hall to act before another tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents and Councilmember Crystal Hudson blame Mayor Adams for unsafe streets. Promised reforms stalled. Crossing guards unfilled. Bike lanes abandoned. Cyclist deaths climb. City Hall defends its record.</p><p class=mb3>This controversy centers on Mayor Eric Adams’ street safety record following the fatal crash that killed 7-year-old Kamari Hughes in Council District 35. The incident, reported on November 3, 2023, highlights Adams’ reversal on key safety policies, including ending the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program and abandoning a planned bike lane on Ashland Place. The Department of Transportation briefly removed a car-free Open Street in Fort Greene, a move traced to City Hall. Councilmember Crystal Hudson, representing District 35, criticized the administration for failing to fill 483 vacant crossing guard positions and for lax speeding enforcement, stating her precinct has 'a long waiting list and not enough crossing guards.' Despite Adams’ claims of 1,000 street redesigns and ongoing efforts, the administration has missed City Council-mandated goals for protected bike and bus lanes. Cycling deaths are at their highest since 2014. DOT touts a record low in pedestrian fatalities and daylighting redesigns, but residents and Hudson say many intersections remain unsafe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
