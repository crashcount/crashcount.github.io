Carroll said, "We think that this will go to the passengers who are disproportionately wealthier than the average New Yorker and significantly wealthier than the driver." The MTA has not considered this per-trip customer fee, and it is unclear if it can be implemented. Taxi advocates support exempting drivers, but experts warn that exempting yellow cabs could shift congestion, undermining the policy’s intent.

The measure raised the payroll mobility tax only for New York City businesses with high payrolls, exempting suburban firms after pushback from their legislators. The Fiscal Policy Institute found this move shifted the tax burden onto Black and Latino workers in the city. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani condemned the policy, saying, 'this illustrates the consequences of fiscal policy that privileges the suburbs over the larger MTA region.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll was one of the few to oppose the exemption. FPI’s Emily Eisner noted, 'there will be a 25-percent decline in the share of white workers impacted by the tax, and a 36-percent increase in the share of Black workers impacted.' Governor Hochul defended the plan as necessary to save the MTA.

Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service.

The bill required the Department of Transportation to post details of all traffic control device and speed reducer requests on a public website. The matter summary reads: 'The required website would include, but need not be limited to, the following information: case number, general topic, issue, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial of traffic control device, and if approved, the timeline for completion.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by 21 co-sponsors including Williams, Hanif, and Yeger. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided, but the measure aimed to end secrecy around life-saving street changes. Public access to this data could expose delays and denials that keep streets deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers and analysts call it unfair. The city shoulders the cost. Suburban riders get a free pass. The MTA’s deficit grows. Transit’s future hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>The proposed payroll mobility tax hike, debated in Albany as of April 26, 2023, would apply only to New York City, leaving suburban counties exempt. The matter, described as a plan to 'save the MTA,' faces criticism for letting 'suburban fatcats' dodge responsibility. Assembly Member Robert Carroll (D-Brooklyn) slammed the exemption, asking, 'We have a regional network, why aren't we having the region pay for it?' Carroll called the carve-out 'unconscionable' and 'ridiculous,' pointing to billions spent on suburban transit. Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany warned the move 'sets a terrible precedent' and deepens inequity. MTA CEO Janno Lieber deferred to lawmakers but stressed the need to close the deficit. The bill’s status remains in flux as budget talks continue. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
