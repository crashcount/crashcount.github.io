Over two hundred injured. In Bushwick (West), the numbers do not lie. In the last twelve months, 443 crashes tore through these streets. Three people lost their lives. Two suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</p><p>A man stands in a crosswalk. A car hits him and launches him into the intersection. The driver flees. Ruari Fay-Handebeaux wakes up in pain. &ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull,&rdquo; he <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>tells ABC7</a>. He is left in the street. His friend wants justice. &ldquo;He gets absolutely launched, maybe 10 to 15 feet right into the middle of the intersection, and just left there,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>says Kevyn Mayhew</a>.</p><p>Hayden Wallace was not so lucky. He died in a hit-and-run. His aunt remembers: &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>recalls Kippy Perkins</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machinery-of-harm>The Machinery of Harm</h3><p>Cars and trucks do most of the damage. In the past three years, they killed and maimed. Vans, sedans, SUVs, trucks, buses. A van killed a 59-year-old man crossing with the signal. A bus struck a 15-year-old girl. A sedan hit a cyclist. The violence is not random. It is routine.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done--and-what-has-not>What Has Been Done — And What Has Not</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They tout speed cameras and lower limits. But the streets remain the same. The intersection where Ruari was hit is unchanged. The law to force repeat offenders into safety courses has lapsed. The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it here. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not words. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
