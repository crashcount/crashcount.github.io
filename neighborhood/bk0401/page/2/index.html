In three years, they killed one, seriously injured three, and left dozens more with broken bones and worse. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt three. Bikes hurt two. The streets are a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City Hall says it is fighting for safer streets. Speed cameras, lower limits, more enforcement. But in Bushwick (West), the carnage continues. The intersection where Ruari Fay-Handebeaux was thrown remains unchanged. The driver who hit him is still free. The city passed Sammy’s Law, letting it lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, another family waits for a call that will break them. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people before cars.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A witness told Streetsblog, "The lady spin around and sped through," and described hearing the impact. The article notes that police have not released the driver's name.

The plan, supported by Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez and Transportation Alternatives, bans cars on a short stretch between Flushing and Johnson Avenues and removes parking at several corners for better visibility—a process known as daylighting. DOT will also narrow Scott Avenue further south and build a concrete pedestrian peninsula at Troutman Street, banning right turns onto Scott. The intersection, described as a 'crash hotspot' with 39 incidents since 2020, will see expanded pedestrian space and improved safety. Gutierrez noted increased foot traffic and little negative feedback. DOT claims the redesign can reduce deaths and serious injuries by up to 45 percent for pedestrians.

One driver collected 563 speed-camera tickets in Sheepshead Bay; another, 474 in Manhattan. The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low. The report highlights a small group’s outsized threat and the policy gap that lets them keep driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No students were on the bus at the time. The victims were hospitalized with serious injuries.
