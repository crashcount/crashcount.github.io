Five left with life-changing injuries. In the last twelve months, 210 people were hurt on the streets of Bushwick (West). The numbers are blunt: 442 crashes, three deaths, three serious injuries. Behind each number is a body, a family, a life split open.</p><p>A 32-year-old man stood in a crosswalk at Wyckoff and Himrod. A car hit him and launched him into the intersection. His friend watched him fly. &ldquo;He gets absolutely launched, maybe 10 to 15 feet right into the middle of the intersection, and just left there,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>said Kevyn Mayhew</a>. The driver fled. The intersection stayed the same.</p><p>A year earlier, a hit-and-run killed Hayden Wallace, 29, in Bushwick. His aunt remembered, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>said Kippy Perkins</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and trucks did most of the damage. In three years, they killed one, seriously injured three, and left dozens more with broken bones and worse. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt three. Bikes hurt two. The streets are a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City Hall says it is fighting for safer streets. Speed cameras, lower limits, more enforcement. But in Bushwick (West), the carnage continues. The intersection where Ruari Fay-Handebeaux was thrown remains unchanged. The driver who hit him is still free. The city passed Sammy’s Law, letting it lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, another family waits for a call that will break them. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people before cars.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
