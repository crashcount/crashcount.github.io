The driver fled. The intersection stayed the same.</p><p>A year earlier, a hit-and-run killed Hayden Wallace, 29, in Bushwick. His aunt remembered, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>said Kippy Perkins</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and trucks did most of the damage. In three years, they killed one, seriously injured three, and left dozens more with broken bones and worse. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt three. Bikes hurt two. The streets are a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City Hall says it is fighting for safer streets. Speed cameras, lower limits, more enforcement. But in Bushwick (West), the carnage continues. The intersection where Ruari Fay-Handebeaux was thrown remains unchanged. The driver who hit him is still free. The city passed Sammy’s Law, letting it lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, another family waits for a call that will break them. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people before cars.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution urged, in its own words, 'top maritime importers to New York City ports to commit to making the City’s streets greener by reducing truck traffic and using marine vessels for last mile deliveries throughout the boroughs.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsored, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate Williams, and others. The bill cited the city’s reliance on trucks—89% of freight—fueling congestion, pollution, and risk for everyone outside a vehicle. The Council pointed to pilot programs like Blue Highways as a way to clear streets and cut emissions. But the resolution was filed without action.

The e-bike rider, a 23-year-old male, sustained injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot, and was conscious at the scene. The report lists 'Following Too Closely' as a contributing factor to the crash. The box truck impacted the right rear bumper, while the e-bike was hit at the center front end.

Nurse pushes for quarterly meetings with city officials, industry, and labor until the program launches. Mayor Adams and Sanitation Commissioner Tisch have delayed the law, citing cost concerns. Nurse insists, 'We are not going backwards. This is something that needs to happen.' The City Council will hold a hearing.

Four hours, then dead. Streets need twelve. Commissioner Tisch says full electrification by 2040 is out of reach. Council Member Nurse backs progress on lighter vehicles but admits heavy-duty tech isn’t ready.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2022, the City Council held a hearing on the Department of Sanitation’s (DSNY) electric vehicle fleet performance and electrification goals. Commissioner Jessica Tisch told the Council, “they basically conked out after four hours—we need them to go 12 hours.” She added, “I don't see today a path forward to fully electrifying the rear-loader portion of the fleet by 2040.” DSNY has ordered seven electric collection trucks and seven sweepers, but only mechanical brooms and light-duty vehicles show promise. Council Member Sandy Nurse praised DSNY’s efforts on lighter vehicles, saying, “Let’s get that done as low-hanging fruit,” but acknowledged the technology gap for heavy-duty trucks. The city faces major hurdles: short battery life, high costs, and the need for new charging infrastructure. Vulnerable road users remain at risk when snow isn’t cleared.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
