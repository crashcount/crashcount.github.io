In three years, they killed one, seriously injured three, and left dozens more with broken bones and worse. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt three. Bikes hurt two. The streets are a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City Hall says it is fighting for safer streets. Speed cameras, lower limits, more enforcement. But in Bushwick (West), the carnage continues. The intersection where Ruari Fay-Handebeaux was thrown remains unchanged. The driver who hit him is still free. The city passed Sammy’s Law, letting it lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, another family waits for a call that will break them. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people before cars.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Advocates Warn Against Further Delays on Commercial Waste Zones,' drew sharp criticism after the Department of Sanitation granted private carters a three-month extension to comply with new requirements. Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, said, 'Commercial waste zone reform can not come fast enough.' The hearing underscored that every delay keeps vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No sunlight.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0283-2022, filed by the Committee on Public Safety, required the NYPD to post quarterly reports on its website about seat belt holds and chokeholds. The bill was introduced April 28, 2022, and marked 'Filed (End of Session)' on December 31, 2023. The matter’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the police department to post quarterly reports on its website relating to the use of seat belt holds and chokeholds.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams sponsored the bill, joined by Council Members Hanif (primary), Hudson, Stevens, Williams, Restler, Krishnan, and Nurse. The bill would have forced the NYPD to disclose the number of seat belt holds and how many failed, leading to chokeholds. The bill stalled. No reports. No new data.

The Department of Transportation would also be barred from authorizing sightseeing bus stops in bus lanes during those hours.

The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment.

Introduced April 14, 2022, the bill required the Department of Transportation to give 60 days’ notice to council members, boards, and local groups before any permanent open street changes. The bill’s summary reads: “notification and community input regarding designation of, removal of and changes to open streets.” Sponsors included Tiffany Cabán (primary), Crystal Hudson, Kamillah Hanks, Oswald Feliz, Farah N. Louis, Kalman Yeger, Sandy Nurse, Shahana K. Hanif, and Althea V. Stevens. The bill mandated a four-week comment window and a two-week response period, plus annual reporting and advance notice for temporary changes. The bill was filed at the end of session, leaving open streets policy unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
