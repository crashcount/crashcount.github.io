The driver fled. The intersection stayed the same.</p><p>A year earlier, a hit-and-run killed Hayden Wallace, 29, in Bushwick. His aunt remembered, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>said Kippy Perkins</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and trucks did most of the damage. In three years, they killed one, seriously injured three, and left dozens more with broken bones and worse. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt three. Bikes hurt two. The streets are a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City Hall says it is fighting for safer streets. Speed cameras, lower limits, more enforcement. But in Bushwick (West), the carnage continues. The intersection where Ruari Fay-Handebeaux was thrown remains unchanged. The driver who hit him is still free. The city passed Sammy’s Law, letting it lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, another family waits for a call that will break them. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people before cars.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

She calls it ineffective and burdensome. Brewer backs bills for safer batteries and worker training. Thirty-one groups join her. Critics warn registration means more stops, fewer bikes, and more danger for riders.</p><p class=mb3>On November 13, 2023, Council Member Gale Brewer (D-Upper West Side) publicly opposed Council Member Bob Holden’s proposed e-bike registration bill. The bill, not yet passed, would require every e-bike in New York City to be registered with the Department of Transportation. Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support. Opponents argue the registration bill could suppress e-bike use, increase police stops in communities of color, and worsen traffic violence. Holden dismissed these concerns, insisting his bill is vital for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Concertgoers demand changes outside Brooklyn Mirage after recent deaths, kidnapping,' follows two deaths and a reported kidnapping near the venue. Gutiérrez acknowledged the need for 'more investment' and called for better lighting, signage, phone/data connectivity, and accessible public transportation. Patrons cited 'serious concerns regarding the safety of concert attendees,' accusing the venue of 'extreme negligence.' The area suffers from poor lighting and unreliable cell service, especially during crowded events. Gutiérrez and other officials support stronger security, a crackdown on unlicensed taxis, and improved infrastructure. The venue claims cooperation with authorities.
