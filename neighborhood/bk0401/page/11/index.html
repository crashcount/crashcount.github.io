The driver fled. The intersection stayed the same.</p><p>A year earlier, a hit-and-run killed Hayden Wallace, 29, in Bushwick. His aunt remembered, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>said Kippy Perkins</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and trucks did most of the damage. In three years, they killed one, seriously injured three, and left dozens more with broken bones and worse. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt three. Bikes hurt two. The streets are a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City Hall says it is fighting for safer streets. Speed cameras, lower limits, more enforcement. But in Bushwick (West), the carnage continues. The intersection where Ruari Fay-Handebeaux was thrown remains unchanged. The driver who hit him is still free. The city passed Sammy’s Law, letting it lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, another family waits for a call that will break them. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people before cars.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan would cap a stretch of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in south Williamsburg, creating 3.5 acres of new parkland. Reynoso called on Governor Kathy Hochul to act as a co-applicant for funds, stating, "We're calling on Gov. Kathy Hochul to be a co-applicant alongside the City of New York for federal funding to finally deck the BQE." Velázquez said, "We are fighting to reimagine the way to reconnect neighborhoods, improve traffic and reduce toxic pollution." Gutierrez stressed the urgent need for open space and clean air.
