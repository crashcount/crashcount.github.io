In three years, they killed one, seriously injured three, and left dozens more with broken bones and worse. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt three. Bikes hurt two. The streets are a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City Hall says it is fighting for safer streets. Speed cameras, lower limits, more enforcement. But in Bushwick (West), the carnage continues. The intersection where Ruari Fay-Handebeaux was thrown remains unchanged. The driver who hit him is still free. The city passed Sammy’s Law, letting it lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, another family waits for a call that will break them. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people before cars.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The push follows years of crashes—67 cyclist injuries and 196 total crashes since 2019—despite so-called 'protected' lanes. The matter, titled 'Activists and electeds ask DOT to add better barriers to Grand Street bike lane,' highlights how plastic bollards fail to stop drivers from blocking lanes, forcing cyclists into traffic. Restler, along with Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Julia Salazar, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, signed a letter urging Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriguez to act. The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected. Activists say, 'We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021.' The call is clear: real barriers, not broken promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists’ voices count.</p><p class=mb3>On February 17, 2022, New York State launched the first New York Bike Census, a voluntary survey led by NYSERDA and Urban Cycling Solutions. The effort is described as 'an unprecedented effort to collect detailed data on bicycle transportation across the state.' The survey asks about riding frequency, infrastructure, barriers, and connections to transit. Assembly Member Robert Carroll and State Senator Julia Salazar have backed related legislation for an e-bike rebate program. The survey’s results will be shared with governments and advocacy groups. Officials say the data will help planners and policymakers 'invest in safer, more equitable multimodal streets.' No direct safety impact assessment was provided, but the project aims to inform future improvements for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
