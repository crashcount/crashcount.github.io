Five left with life-changing injuries. In the last twelve months, 210 people were hurt on the streets of Bushwick (West). The numbers are blunt: 442 crashes, three deaths, three serious injuries. Behind each number is a body, a family, a life split open.</p><p>A 32-year-old man stood in a crosswalk at Wyckoff and Himrod. A car hit him and launched him into the intersection. His friend watched him fly. &ldquo;He gets absolutely launched, maybe 10 to 15 feet right into the middle of the intersection, and just left there,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>said Kevyn Mayhew</a>. The driver fled. The intersection stayed the same.</p><p>A year earlier, a hit-and-run killed Hayden Wallace, 29, in Bushwick. His aunt remembered, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>said Kippy Perkins</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and trucks did most of the damage. In three years, they killed one, seriously injured three, and left dozens more with broken bones and worse. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt three. Bikes hurt two. The streets are a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City Hall says it is fighting for safer streets. Speed cameras, lower limits, more enforcement. But in Bushwick (West), the carnage continues. The intersection where Ruari Fay-Handebeaux was thrown remains unchanged. The driver who hit him is still free. The city passed Sammy’s Law, letting it lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, another family waits for a call that will break them. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people before cars.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A 2013 BMW sedan, traveling north and making a left turn, struck a 2024 ZNEN moped also traveling north straight ahead. The point of impact was the sedan's left rear quarter panel, damaging its left side doors, while the moped sustained no damage. The moped driver, a 58-year-old male, was injured with neck contusions and remained conscious and not ejected. The report cites 'Unsafe Lane Changing' as the contributing factor, indicating the sedan driver failed to execute a safe lane maneuver. The moped driver wore a helmet, but no victim behaviors were listed as contributing factors. The evidence highlights driver error in lane changing as the cause of this collision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users get a win.</p><p class=mb3>On October 2, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a policy reversal on McGuinness Boulevard. The original lane reduction and protected bike lane plan, previously scrapped, will now move forward for the southern half of the street, between Calyer Street and Meeker Avenue. The matter, described as a return to 'the road diet it had previously finalized and then rejected,' follows months of community outcry and advocacy. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and other local officials celebrated the move, crediting the Make McGuinness Safe coalition for relentless pressure. Restler stated, 'this is a decision that enhances safety in our community, and that's what matters.' The northern half of the boulevard remains unchanged, with two traffic lanes and barrier-protected bike lanes. The city’s action signals a renewed commitment to street safety after repeated delays and political interference.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sedan's driver failed to obey traffic controls, leading directly to the deadly impact. The report does not list any victim behaviors as contributing factors. The e-bike rider was ejected and died at the scene. The crash involved two sedans—one moving, one parked—and an e-bike. The focus remains on the sedan driver's disregard for traffic control, which proved fatal for the vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both vehicles were reported as going straight ahead at the time of impact. The truck's left front quarter panel was struck, and the motorcycle overturned. The report makes no mention of any victim error or behavior contributing to the crash.

The plan, not a council bill but a Department of Transportation decision, extends parking-protected bike lanes from Calyer Street to Meeker Avenue. Councilmember Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, criticized the move, saying, 'The mayor has put forward a compromise that nobody likes.' A coalition of elected officials—including Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso—called for a more thorough redesign, arguing the current plan preserves dangerous elements. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone claimed the redesign will make the corridor safer for all users, with new bike lanes and sidewalk extensions. Despite these claims, advocates and local leaders argue the plan fails to address core dangers and puts vulnerable road users at continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, led by NYC DOT, brings mid-block crossings, concrete pedestrian islands, curb enhancements, and split-phase signals to one of Brooklyn’s deadliest corridors. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push.

Of 57 boards, 38 opposed the plan, 20 supported it, mostly in denser neighborhoods. The proposal, described as aiming to build 'a little more housing in every neighborhood,' faces resistance in low-density areas. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Woodhaven) opposed more housing in her district, calling it 'suburbs.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized neighborhoods that refuse new housing, saying it increases pressure on poorer areas. Arlene Schlesinger, a Queens resident, voiced strong opposition, especially to lifting parking mandates and adding accessory dwelling units. Community boards, often older and whiter, resist change, leaving the city’s most vulnerable to bear the brunt of housing and transportation inequity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Swimmers keep dying.</p><p class=mb3>On July 22, 2024, after a fifth drowning at a New York City beach, Council Member Justin Brannan (District 47) joined other officials to demand urgent action. The group called for expanded lifeguard hours, more staff, and new public pools. The Adams administration rejected these measures, relying instead on NYPD drones and Parks Enforcement Patrols. The matter, described as 'Body found in fifth apparent drowning off NYC beach as pols call for more lifeguard hours,' highlights the deadly gap in city safety policy. Brannan, along with Council Member Shekar Krishnan and Borough Presidents Donovan Richards and Antonio Reynoso, urged the city to extend the beach season, increase lifeguard shifts, and offer universal swimming lessons. The city has only 870 lifeguards, far short of the 1,500 needed. Vulnerable swimmers remain at risk while officials debate. The toll mounts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
