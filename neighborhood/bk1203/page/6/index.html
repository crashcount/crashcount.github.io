Nearly five hundred hurt. In the last three and a half years, Kensington has seen 823 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. One pedestrian crushed by a truck on Caton Avenue. A motorcyclist, age 35, ejected and killed at Dahill Road. A woman, 38, dead behind the wheel on Ditmas Avenue. The list goes on. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a></p><p>Children are not spared. In the past year, six kids were injured in crashes. The old are not spared. Four people over 75, hurt. The middle-aged, the young, the nameless—none are safe. The streets do not care.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Trucks kill. Motorcycles maim. Bikes are not the threat. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans caused the bulk of pedestrian injuries. Trucks took lives. Motorcycles left bodies broken. Bikes caused no deaths here. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>collision records</a></p><p>Distraction kills. Drivers not looking. Brakes that fail. A right turn that ends a life. The causes are plain in the records, but the pain is not.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But Kensington waits. The speed limit is not yet 20 mph. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are made. Streets stay the same.</p><p>No new protections for the most vulnerable. No new miles of protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns. The silence is loud. The danger is routine.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. This is policy, inertia, and neglect. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure aims to close a $35 billion hole in the MTA’s five-year capital plan, which covers subway and bus upgrades. The bill has no number yet and remains under negotiation. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, 'The discussion on revenue raisers is definitely going to have to be a part of the MTA.' Senator Steve Chan, District 17, criticized the tax hike, calling it 'a slap on the Brooklyn businesses struggling for survival in my district.' The talks also floated surcharges on for-hire vehicles and online deliveries. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The budget deadline looms.

The law demands the Department of Transportation install pavement markings or temporary lines within five business days after any street resurfacing.

Assemblymember Robert Carroll pushes for a higher congestion toll, putting it above his own delivery fee plan. Albany stalls. Riders wait. Infrastructure ages. Danger grows for those outside cars.</p><p class=mb3>On January 31, 2025, the New York City Council debated MTA funding options. Assemblymember Robert Carroll (District 44) voiced support for increasing the congestion toll, stating it should come before his earlier $3 delivery fee proposal. The debate, covered in the article '5 ways the MTA could get the money it needs to fix aging infrastructure,' highlights the lack of consensus among lawmakers. Governor Hochul’s budget falls short. Senate and Assembly leaders have not chosen a revenue source. Carroll’s stance: 'increasing the congestion toll should come first.' Other options—taxing the rich, payroll tax hikes, vice taxes—face resistance. MTA Chair Janno Lieber urges focus on repairs, not expansion. No direct safety analysis was provided, but the delay in funding leaves vulnerable road users exposed to the risks of failing infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
