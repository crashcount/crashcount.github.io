Nearly five hundred hurt. In the last three and a half years, Kensington has seen 823 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. One pedestrian crushed by a truck on Caton Avenue. A motorcyclist, age 35, ejected and killed at Dahill Road. A woman, 38, dead behind the wheel on Ditmas Avenue. The list goes on. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a></p><p>Children are not spared. In the past year, six kids were injured in crashes. The old are not spared. Four people over 75, hurt. The middle-aged, the young, the nameless—none are safe. The streets do not care.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Trucks kill. Motorcycles maim. Bikes are not the threat. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans caused the bulk of pedestrian injuries. Trucks took lives. Motorcycles left bodies broken. Bikes caused no deaths here. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>collision records</a></p><p>Distraction kills. Drivers not looking.

The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But Kensington waits. The speed limit is not yet 20 mph. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are made. Streets stay the same.</p><p>No new protections for the most vulnerable. No new miles of protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns. The silence is loud. The danger is routine.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. This is policy, inertia, and neglect. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The money would fund city infrastructure. Trucks crowd streets. Packages pile up. The bill aims to slow the flood. City Hall will review. Delivery giants face new rules. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill on March 23, 2023, proposing a 25-cent surcharge on every online delivery package in New York City. The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bills aimed to stop deadly fires without punishing those who rely on e-bikes to survive.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, the New York City Council advanced a package of lithium-ion battery safety bills. Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency outlined two options: diverting traffic onto local streets or constructing a bypass road. The matter, described as 'a controversial possibility reminiscent of an earlier plan,' sparked outrage. Assembly Member Robert Carroll slammed the idea of sending trucks onto residential blocks as 'insane.' Lara Birnback of the Brooklyn Heights Association called the plan disruptive and wasteful. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez highlighted public calls for 'safer bike and pedestrian connections' and new green space. No bill number or committee was cited. The plan remains a proposal, with no set price or location.

Injuries included a 51-year-old man with facial crush injuries, a 79-year-old woman with a fractured leg, and several children and adults with pain to the head, back, and legs.

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City studies a short stretch. Ten miles of highway cut through Brooklyn. Local leaders warn of neglect. Pollution and danger persist. No plan means more harm for people on foot, bike, or bus.</p><p class=mb3>On February 9, 2023, Governor Hochul’s administration confirmed the state has 'no plans' to redesign its portion of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, states the state DOT will only provide technical help to the city’s study of the 1.5-mile city-owned segment between Atlantic Avenue and Sands Street. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the state’s lack of engagement: 'The state hasn't engaged in any way shape or form.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said her community wants the BQE 'revisioned and totally changed,' citing environmental and health impacts. Assembly Member Robert Carroll warned that lack of coordination could worsen problems. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon echoed fears that her constituents would be left behind. The city, under Mayor Adams, has pledged a 'corridor-wide vision,' but admits nothing comprehensive can happen without state DOT. No safety analyst has assessed the impact, but the state’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter focused on 'the impact of low MTA funding and long wait times.' Simon said, 'It is really critically important...for people to be able to take reliable, safe, regular, speedy-enough transit service. That’s what’s going to get people out of their cars.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymembers Robert Carroll and Zohran Mamdani also participated, urging Albany to boost state funding and implement congestion pricing.
