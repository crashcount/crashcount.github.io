Nearly five hundred hurt. In the last three and a half years, Kensington has seen 823 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. One pedestrian crushed by a truck on Caton Avenue. A motorcyclist, age 35, ejected and killed at Dahill Road. A woman, 38, dead behind the wheel on Ditmas Avenue.

In the last three years, SUVs and sedans caused the bulk of pedestrian injuries. Trucks took lives. Motorcycles left bodies broken. Bikes caused no deaths here. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>collision records</a></p><p>Distraction kills. Drivers not looking.

The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But Kensington waits. The speed limit is not yet 20 mph. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are made. Streets stay the same.</p><p>No new protections for the most vulnerable. No new miles of protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns. The silence is loud. The danger is routine.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. This is policy, inertia, and neglect. Call your council member.

Vulnerable New Yorkers remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On September 18, 2023, the City Council reviewed the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program (DVAP), which is set to expire on October 26. The Transportation Committee, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a final report on the program’s effectiveness. The bill required drivers with 15 speed-camera or five red-light tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. Council Member Shahana Hanif voiced disappointment, noting, 'We need to not only reauthorize this program, but strengthen it.' Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data. The lack of enforcement leaves dangerous drivers on the road and vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Guerrero was struck by a Honda CRV while cycling in Brooklyn and died from his injuries. The 74-year-old driver was not charged. Hanif stated, 'We have been proactive and pushing against what this mayor is doing to undo street safety. We need to have the political courage across all levels of government to create a city that is walkable, prioritizes pedestrians, and ends these senseless murders.' Eric McClure of StreetsPAC added, 'Any death is a tragedy and [the] deaths so far this year is a really significant number. We need to do better.'

Brooklyn Council Member Shahana Hanif accused Mayor Adams of 'undoing street safety' and called for 'political courage' to protect pedestrians and cyclists. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives demanded immediate, legally-required action under the NYC Streets Plan. Fourteen of the 20 deaths involved e-bikes. Ninety-three percent of fatalities happened on streets lacking protected lanes. Despite record ridership, the city missed its own goals for new bike lanes.

Gounardes and Assembly Member Gallagher push a bill to force repeat speeders to install limiters. The tech would cap speed, targeting drivers with six or more tickets. Advocates say it could cut deaths. Reckless drivers face real consequences.</p><p class=mb3>On August 2, 2023, State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher announced new legislation targeting recidivist reckless drivers. The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Some want to exempt yellow cabs and drivers, shifting costs to wealthier riders. Critics warn loopholes could push more cars onto crowded streets, risking more crashes for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate centers on congestion pricing in Manhattan, with proposals aired on June 21, 2023. The Traffic Mobility Review Board must decide if yellow cab and Uber/Lyft drivers will be tolled, or if only passengers will pay. Assembly Member Robert Carroll and advocate Alex Matthiessen back a higher passenger surcharge for Uber/Lyft rides, exempting drivers and yellow cabs. Carroll argues, 'passengers are disproportionately wealthier than the average New Yorker and significantly wealthier than the driver.' Taxi advocate Bhairavi Desai supports exempting drivers to protect jobs. Economist Charles Komanoff and analyst Bruce Schaller warn that exempting yellow cabs could shift congestion, undermining safety and policy goals. The matter’s outcome will shape who pays—and who faces the danger—on Manhattan’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
