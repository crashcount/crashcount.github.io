Jamaica Avenue hours slashed. Archer stays 24/7. Northern Boulevard bus lanes started after months of delay. Local politicians fought restrictions. Bus riders still face slow trips. City bows to business pressure.</p><p class=mb3>On November 15, 2022, the Adams administration made busways on Jamaica and Archer avenues permanent after a one-year pilot. The Department of Transportation cut Jamaica Avenue’s busway hours from 24/7 to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, while Archer Avenue remains round-the-clock. The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT offers no timeline.</p><p class=mb3>On November 11, 2022, Councilmember Rita Joseph (District 40) issued a public letter to the Department of Transportation, demanding answers for the slow pace of speed hump installations. The matter, titled "#StuckAtDOT: It Takes Years (and Years) to Get a Speed Hump in this City," details Joseph’s frustration: 'In response to a speed hump request, my office was informed by the DOT that...studies are finalized after two years.' Joseph listed twelve locations needing speed humps; only one was approved, none installed. Eight were denied, several remain under review. Her district saw 1,173 crashes this year, injuring 87 cyclists and 141 pedestrians. Joseph, who lost students to traffic violence, calls the delay 'unacceptable.' DOT says it is reviewing her letter. Advocates demand faster action, saying, 'It should never take two years to implement these straight-forward safety measures.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets remain dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On October 21, 2022, police in Bay Ridge arrested Ibrahim Chaaban for reckless driving after he performed donuts on Shore Road. The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Some want tight limits. Others push for taxi exemptions and tunnel credits. Advocates warn: too many carve-outs gut the plan. The final call lands with the Traffic Mobility Review Board.</p><p class=mb3>On August 26, 2022, New York officials debated congestion pricing exemptions as the policy neared implementation. The discussion, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted shifting positions. State Senator Leroy Comrie, once opposed to exemptions, now listens to public input. Assembly Member Robert Carroll said, "I think that there should be limited exemptions." State Senator Andrew Gounardes added, "Obviously we want them to be as limited as possible." Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine backed toll credits for tunnel users and taxi exemptions. Taxi and for-hire drivers lobbied for relief, citing existing surcharges. Advocacy groups warned against broad carve-outs. The Traffic Mobility Review Board will decide on further exemptions after federal review. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
