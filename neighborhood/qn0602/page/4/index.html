Five serious injuries. 631 people hurt.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Forest Hills since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are bodies broken, lives changed. In the last year alone, 212 people were injured here. Four suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. No one died in the last twelve months, but luck will not hold.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> An 18-year-old was killed by an SUV on the Long Island Expressway. A 16-year-old girl, crossing with the light, was struck by a bus on Yellowstone Boulevard. A cyclist’s face was torn open in a crash with a van on 108th Street. These are not rare events—they are the drumbeat of daily life in Forest Hills. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-wound-and-kill>The Vehicles That Wound and Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds.</strong> In Forest Hills, SUVs and cars caused the only death and most serious injuries. Trucks and buses left two people with life-altering wounds. Bikes and mopeds hurt others. The street does not forgive mistakes, and the biggest machines do the most harm.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> The city touts new speed limits, more cameras, and intersection redesigns. But in Forest Hills, the carnage continues. The numbers do not move fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it here. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The rest of the streets are left to chance.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every injury, every death, is preventable. Demand more. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, build real protection for people on foot and bike, and keep the cameras running.

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill was introduced on September 12, 2024, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure the same day. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the operation of shared electric scooter systems on certain streets in the Borough of Queens.' Council Members Lynn C. Schulman (District 29, primary sponsor) and Sandra Ung (District 20, co-sponsor) back the measure. The bill would stop shared e-scooter organizations from operating in a dense, contested part of Queens. No safety analysis was provided. The legislation draws a hard line on who can move—and how—on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seven bills target reckless e-bike riding, battery fires, and low pay. Lawmakers want apps to answer for worker traffic violations and vehicle safety. Pedestrians and cyclists face daily danger. Councilmember Schulman called for accountability.</p><p class=mb3>On June 21, 2024, the NYC Council's Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection held a hearing on seven bills regulating delivery apps. The bills aim to address 'myriad health and safety concerns' from e-bike crashes, battery fires, and low pay. Councilmember Lynn Schulman, District 29, spoke out: 'Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed... This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk.' Three bills would make apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash responsible for vehicle safety and compliance, require them to provide safety-compliant e-bikes, and ensure mopeds are registered. Other bills target pay transparency and tip protections. Councilmembers Shaun Abreu and Rafael Salamanca also spoke in support. The measures seek to hold companies accountable for dangers faced by vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
