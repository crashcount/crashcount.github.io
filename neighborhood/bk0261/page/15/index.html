They say they are redesigning intersections and lowering speed limits. But in the Navy Yard, the pace is slow. The crashes keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph.

The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No one should die crossing the street.</strong> The city can act. The council can demand lower speed limits. The mayor can order more cameras and redesigns. Albany can keep the cameras running. But nothing changes unless people demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi claimed some locals want three lanes each way, but 17 elected officials, including State Sen. Julia Salazar, Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, and Council Member Lincoln Restler, publicly rejected the idea. Salazar said, 'no to three lanes. Two lanes at most.' Gounardes confirmed, 'all support a two-lane highway.' Gallagher wrote, '2 lanes if any.' Restler called City Hall’s statements 'plainly inaccurate.' The Department of Transportation delayed environmental review to study both options. Advocates and officials urge investment in mass transit, not highway expansion. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the city weighs more lanes for cars and trucks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight for safer streets and fewer cars continues.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, the NYC DOT held a public meeting to present refined redesign concepts for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The meeting drew over 100 attendees. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) voiced concerns about the lack of information on neighborhood impacts, costs, and the city’s refusal to commit to reducing the BQE to two lanes in each direction. The DOT presented three proposals—The Terraces, The Lookout, and The Stoop—aiming to repair the crumbling highway and reconnect Brooklyn Heights to Brooklyn Bridge Park. Restler said, 'We need a commitment that this is the long-term solution.' Residents like Cindy McLaughlin pushed for a walkable, green city, while Amy Breedlove warned that wider highways mean more danger on local streets. The DOT delayed its environmental review to study lane reduction, but offered no clear promises. Construction is set for 2027, after a two-year federal review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who introduced the original legislation, stressed the need for clear guidance. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure highlighted the deadly consequences of delay. DSNY opposes a bill from Council Member Sandy Nurse to create a working group to address these setbacks.

Councilmember Lincoln Restler called the timeline 'extremely slow' and said delays undermine the law's worker and environmental justice goals.

Intro 501 would fine drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants, with civilians able to report violations and receive a portion of the fine. Reynoso said, 'Those are two pieces I’d love to see pushed absolutely.' He also champions protected bike lanes, a comprehensive bike network, and the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway. Reynoso’s stance is clear: streets must be safer for people walking and biking. He wants action after recent traffic violence and supports more open streets.

City studies a short stretch. Ten miles of highway cut through Brooklyn. Local leaders warn of neglect. Pollution and danger persist. No plan means more harm for people on foot, bike, or bus.</p><p class=mb3>On February 9, 2023, Governor Hochul’s administration confirmed the state has 'no plans' to redesign its portion of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, states the state DOT will only provide technical help to the city’s study of the 1.5-mile city-owned segment between Atlantic Avenue and Sands Street. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the state’s lack of engagement: 'The state hasn't engaged in any way shape or form.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said her community wants the BQE 'revisioned and totally changed,' citing environmental and health impacts. Assembly Member Robert Carroll warned that lack of coordination could worsen problems. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon echoed fears that her constituents would be left behind. The city, under Mayor Adams, has pledged a 'corridor-wide vision,' but admits nothing comprehensive can happen without state DOT. No safety analyst has assessed the impact, but the state’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, saw Simon and other officials racing at Smith-9th Streets station to dramatize the daily struggle of straphangers. The matter focused on 'the impact of low MTA funding and long wait times.' Simon said, 'It is really critically important...for people to be able to take reliable, safe, regular, speedy-enough transit service. That’s what’s going to get people out of their cars.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymembers Robert Carroll and Zohran Mamdani also participated, urging Albany to boost state funding and implement congestion pricing. The lawmakers oppose fare hikes and the rider-funded model, calling for public dollars to improve frequency and reliability. No formal bill was cited, but the advocacy targets the state budget and MTA funding structure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its matter title reads: 'Requires the consideration of complete street design for certain transportation projects which receive federal or state funding.' Didi Barrett leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Amy Paulin, Carrie Woerner, and many others as co-sponsors. The bill compels agencies to consider complete street design—meaning streets built for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users, not just drivers. It also requires the department to publish guidance and reference materials for public use.
