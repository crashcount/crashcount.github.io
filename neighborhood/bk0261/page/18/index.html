The piece urges the Federal Highway Administration to approve the MTA's Central Business District Tolling Program. Restler writes, "Congestion pricing will reduce through-traffic in our neighborhood, improve air quality and quality of life for residents, and allow for substantial investments in a public transportation system that all New Yorkers rely on." He highlights the risk of further delay for the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, a corridor plagued by crashes and pollution. Restler supports reducing car dependence and warns that restoring more lanes to the BQE would fuel more danger and cost. The op-ed calls for bold action to protect communities and prioritize transit over traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Mayor’s Management Report shows only 32 protected bike lane miles and 2 bus lane miles added in fiscal year 2022—far short of the annual targets. Councilman Lincoln Restler, District 33, is quoted: “We’ve approved $904 million for better bus lanes, more pedestrian space, and protected bike lanes and now we need to pick up the pace on implementation.” Restler pledges robust oversight and accountability, pressing the Department of Transportation to deliver. The report details frustration from council members and advocates over missed deadlines, slow progress, and persistent dangers for vulnerable road users.

The event came as the public comment period for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Central Business District Tolling Program ended. The plan would toll drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street, aiming to cut traffic and pollution. Restler said, “This is a tangible, major, sweeping policy that will dramatically reduce the number of cars and trucks on the street in New York City.” He supported limited exemptions, especially for taxis and for-hire vehicles, but stressed the need to keep cars off the road. The rally urged the Federal Highway Administration to approve the plan, which is expected to shift commuters to mass transit and modernize city infrastructure. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon also backed a taxi carveout.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event came as the public comment period for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Central Business District Tolling Program ended. The plan would toll drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street, aiming to cut traffic and pollution. Restler said, “This is a tangible, major, sweeping policy that will dramatically reduce the number of cars and trucks on the street in New York City.” He supported limited exemptions, especially for taxis and for-hire vehicles, but stressed the need to keep cars off the road. The rally urged the Federal Highway Administration to approve the plan, which is expected to shift commuters to mass transit and modernize city infrastructure. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon also backed a taxi carveout.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Wright said, 'Congestion pricing will have benefits for communities across the city and region: It will reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. It will raise vital revenue for public transit. It will make the transportation system more equitable.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler planned a rally in support. The statement acknowledged minor impacts, like increased traffic on select highways, but insisted these can be addressed by electrifying fleets and capping highways.

The Department of Transportation opposes this measure. The incident, reported August 5, 2022, highlights weak NYPD enforcement against placard abuse and illegal plate covers. The matter centers on a car parked in a federal zone with obscured plates, a violation of state law. NYPD agents hesitated to act, citing placard status and unclear jurisdiction, but issued a $65 ticket after supervisor intervention. The bill, now in committee, aims to break the cycle of impunity for placard holders. Restler has also called for the elimination of placards entirely, stating, 'there are way too many scofflaw federal officers out there driving way too much to get from their (likely) suburban homes to their free, placard-guaranteed parking space in Lower Manhattan.' The affair exposes systemic failures in protecting pedestrians and cyclists from the dangers of unchecked car privilege.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Restler and neighbors slammed the weakest plan. They want a lane removed, real protection for people. DOT says nothing is final. The street remains a danger. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On July 7, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation presented three redesign options for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious crash corridor in Brooklyn. The proposals, discussed at Community Board 1’s Transportation Committee, included: keeping all travel lanes with added bike lanes (Plan A), removing a lane for protected bike lanes and pedestrian islands (Plan B), and a two-way bike lane with a buffer (Plan C). Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) criticized the weakest plan, saying, 'I’m really disappointed that after hearing so clearly from the elected officials in the community, from many thousands of neighborhood residents—that still DOT came forward with this presentation tonight.' Restler and others urged DOT to remove a vehicle lane, citing ongoing deaths and injuries. Over 2,500 residents signed a petition for dramatic change. DOT has not made a final decision and promised more community engagement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Community demands safety, not parking.</p><p class=mb3>On July 1, 2022, the NYC Council held an oversight hearing on the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) preliminary redesign of McGuinness Boulevard. The matter, titled 'Adams Administration’s McGuinness Redesign Options Underwhelm Street Safety Boosters,' outlined three options: only one would remove travel lanes and add protected bike lanes. Council Member Lincoln Restler, joined by Assembly Member Emily Gallagher and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, criticized DOT’s proposals as 'inadequate.' Restler stated, 'The way we're going to fully connect Greenpoint community and make this street safer is by having less lanes of traffic.' Advocates and residents backed lane reductions and protected bike lanes, citing three deaths since 2014. DOT cited traffic concerns and delayed action. The hearing exposed a rift between community safety demands and DOT’s reluctance to prioritize vulnerable road users over car throughput and parking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation will present its draft plan to Brooklyn Community Board 1’s Transportation Committee on June 30. The petition, described as a call for 'wider sidewalks and a wider median, a protected bike lane, and eliminating one lane of traffic in each direction,' follows the hit-and-run death of teacher Matthew Jensen. Gallagher stated, 'Our community is speaking loud and clear: no more deaths on McGuinness.' The campaign has support from Councilmember Lincoln Restler and Borough President Antonio Reynoso. The street, a busy four-lane truck route, has seen dozens of crashes and injuries in recent years. Organizers and residents demand urgent action to end the deadly toll on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislation, discussed in the City Council, exempts NYPD, news, and hospital helicopters. The bill’s matter title: 'Stop the Chop.' Council Members Amanda Farias, Gale Brewer, Shahana Hanif, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Christopher Marte, and Carlina Rivera joined as sponsors. Hanif stated, 'Our airspace is not for sale to the highest bidder and should only be available to essential needs of our city.' The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution. The proposal aims to cut thousands of flights, reduce greenhouse gases, and restore peace to city parks and neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
