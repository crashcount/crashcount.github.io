Two seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, the Brooklyn Navy Yard has seen 102 crashes. Fifty-four people have been injured. One did not go home. Two were left with wounds that do not heal fast. These are not numbers. They are lives, broken on the road. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> A 59-year-old woman was killed crossing Kent Avenue. The SUV kept going. A cyclist, 24, was thrown from his bike after a car cut him off. Another cyclist, 39, hit by a sedan, left bleeding in the street. A 53-year-old woman, walking, hit by a car at the crosswalk. The pattern is plain. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They say they are redesigning intersections and lowering speed limits. But in the Navy Yard, the pace is slow. The crashes keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. Laws lapse. Programs expire. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No one should die crossing the street.</strong> The city can act. The council can demand lower speed limits. The mayor can order more cameras and redesigns. Albany can keep the cameras running. But nothing changes unless people demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The DOT’s first plan would have cut traffic lanes and added a parking-protected bike lane. Adams ordered a weaker version after business pushback. The compromise left two car lanes in each direction during the day. Elected officials—U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and Council Member Lincoln Restler—sent a letter urging DOT to restore the full safety plan, writing, “Nothing has been done to improve conditions for pedestrians.” Advocates say the new design increases crossing distances and leaves cyclists and pedestrians exposed.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks to prohibit vendors from pedestrian paths, bike lanes, and bridge approaches. The matter, described as a 'span ban,' drew strong public support for restrictions. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing Brooklyn, stated, 'I am a strong supporter of vending, but it should go in designated spaces... the Brooklyn Bridge is not the place for it.' He thanked DOT for acting to eliminate vending on the bridge, but called for more vendor licenses elsewhere. Vendors and advocates argued the ban is too harsh, urging specific rules instead of a blanket prohibition. DOT will review public comments before finalizing the rule.

Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024.

Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned Bearak’s oversight, stating, 'The Department of Transportation has been neutered.' Bearak, with no transportation background, was placed in this role by Ingrid Lewis-Martin, the mayor’s chief adviser. Officials say this process undermines DOT’s ability to deliver on the Streets Master Plan and the mayor’s promises, risking more deaths and injuries for vulnerable road users.

Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure.

In 2022, the city built only 4.4 miles of bus lanes and 26.3 miles of bike lanes, far short of the legal benchmarks.
