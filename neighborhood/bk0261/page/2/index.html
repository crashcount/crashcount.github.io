Two were left with wounds that do not heal fast. These are not numbers.

The SUV kept going. A cyclist, 24, was thrown from his bike after a car cut him off. Another cyclist, 39, hit by a sedan, left bleeding in the street. A 53-year-old woman, walking, hit by a car at the crosswalk. The pattern is plain. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They say they are redesigning intersections and lowering speed limits. But in the Navy Yard, the pace is slow. The crashes keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. Laws lapse. Programs expire. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No one should die crossing the street.</strong> The city can act. The council can demand lower speed limits. The mayor can order more cameras and redesigns. Albany can keep the cameras running. But nothing changes unless people demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds.

Another life lost. The toll rises. Grief sharpens the call for change. Streets stay deadly. The city fails to shield its own. The group grows. The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2025, Gersh Kuntzman issued an advocacy statement, reported by Streetsblog NYC. The statement reads, 'There's a new member of Families for Safe Streets, which is not good news.' Joe Jankoski, mourning Amanda Servedio, spoke out after her death by a recidivist speeder. The group’s ranks swell with each tragedy. No specific bill or committee is named in this event. Kuntzman’s statement underscores the relentless danger faced by pedestrians and cyclists. The safety analyst notes: the event describes a new member joining an advocacy group, which does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety at the population level. The city’s streets remain perilous. The group’s growth is a grim measure of failure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Christopher Marte leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gale A. Brewer, Shahana K. Hanif, Sandy Nurse, Linda Lee, Keith Powers, Lincoln Restler, Chi A. Ossé, Selvena N.

Mayor Eric Adams calls for listening to bike lane critics. Challenger Sabrina Gates wants the lane rerouted. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defends the lane’s safety record.

Councilmember Lincoln Restler, a strong backer of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, challenged the ballot access of opponent Sabrina Gates, claiming her campaign misled petition signers. A judge ruled Gates had enough valid signatures. The bike lane, built by the Department of Transportation in September, faces fierce opposition from Hasidic residents worried about child safety. At least two children have been injured by cyclists, fueling calls to reroute the lane. Over 3,200 residents signed a petition against it. Cycling advocates and Restler point to a 25% drop in injuries since the lane’s installation. Gates argues more must be done to address community complaints. The court battle centered on ballot signatures, not the lane itself, but the fight underscores deep tensions over street safety and representation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers.

Introduced April 24, 2025, it urges the State Legislature and Governor to ban police courtesy cards. The resolution states: 'prohibiting the issuance of police courtesy cards.' Council Members Chi A. Ossé (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, and Tiffany Cabán back the measure. The cards, handed out by NYPD union members, let friends and relatives skirt penalties for traffic violations. The practice breeds unequal enforcement. A 2024 lawsuit exposed how officers faced pressure to honor these cards, even after a $175,000 city settlement. The bill demands an end to this shadow system. It seeks one law for all, no matter who you know.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, introduced April 24, 2025, calls for 'requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits.' Council Member Lincoln Restler leads, joined by Salaam, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Banks, and Brannan. The bill would force drivers with eleven or more points in eighteen months, or six speed/red light camera tickets in a year, to install speed-limiting tech. The Council cites data: 265 killed, 52,949 injured on city streets in 2023. The measure aims to put a brake on reckless driving. The committee has not yet advanced the resolution.

The measure, still in committee, follows the 2023 law that limited outdoor dining to April through November. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) leads the charge, calling the current law a 'failure' that 'prioritized parking spots over vibrant streets.' Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Lawmakers and advocates agree: high costs, bureaucracy, and seasonality block participation and hurt street life. The bill's fate remains undecided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won and backed by 25 sponsors, aims to improve visibility and protect pedestrians. DOT officials opposed the measure, citing a study that warns of increased injuries without costly infrastructure, estimating a $3 billion price tag. Won called the study 'deeply flawed.' Council Member Lincoln Restler blasted DOT for ignoring dangerous corners in his district. Chris Banks opposed the bill over parking concerns. Advocates and Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla countered, pointing to cheap, effective daylighting elsewhere.

Prosecutors allege Yarimi drove nearly 70 mph, ran red lights, and turned right on red with a suspended license and dozens of prior speeding tickets. She struck a for-hire car, then hit Natasha Saada and her three children, killing the mother and two daughters. The surviving son remains in a coma. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called it 'among the worst collisions he has seen in his 25 years.' The article notes that advocates are pushing for laws requiring speed-limiters on cars of repeat speeders.
