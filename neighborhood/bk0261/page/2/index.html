Two seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, the Brooklyn Navy Yard has seen 102 crashes. Fifty-four people have been injured. One did not go home. Two were left with wounds that do not heal fast. These are not numbers. They are lives, broken on the road. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> A 59-year-old woman was killed crossing Kent Avenue. The SUV kept going. A cyclist, 24, was thrown from his bike after a car cut him off. Another cyclist, 39, hit by a sedan, left bleeding in the street. A 53-year-old woman, walking, hit by a car at the crosswalk. The pattern is plain. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They say they are redesigning intersections and lowering speed limits. But in the Navy Yard, the pace is slow. The crashes keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. Laws lapse. Programs expire. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No one should die crossing the street.</strong> The city can act. The council can demand lower speed limits. The mayor can order more cameras and redesigns. Albany can keep the cameras running. But nothing changes unless people demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No bill number or committee was cited. The matter: 'The Bedford Avenue protected bike lane is facing opposition from key figures in the Brooklyn Democratic machine.' Council Members Lincoln Restler and Chi Oss support the lane. Former Adams chief of staff Frank Carone and Brooklyn party chair Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn lead the opposition. Mayor Eric Adams calls for listening to bike lane critics. Challenger Sabrina Gates wants the lane rerouted. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defends the lane’s safety record. A safety analyst warns: 'Threats to protected bike lanes undermine safe infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, potentially reducing mode shift and safety in numbers while increasing risk for vulnerable road users.'

Councilmember Lincoln Restler, a strong backer of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, challenged the ballot access of opponent Sabrina Gates, claiming her campaign misled petition signers. A judge ruled Gates had enough valid signatures. The bike lane, built by the Department of Transportation in September, faces fierce opposition from Hasidic residents worried about child safety. At least two children have been injured by cyclists, fueling calls to reroute the lane. Over 3,200 residents signed a petition against it. Cycling advocates and Restler point to a 25% drop in injuries since the lane’s installation. Gates argues more must be done to address community complaints.

Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the policy, asking, "What am I supposed to do, to look my constituents...in the eye and tell them...the Parks Department isn't gonna come by to plant a tree for nine years?" Adam Ganser of New Yorkers for Parks blamed budget cuts and underfunding. Brad Vogel, a Brooklyn resident, called the grassroots request system "critical." The city’s nearly 900,000 trees fight pollution and heatwaves.

The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection.
