Two seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, the Brooklyn Navy Yard has seen 102 crashes. Fifty-four people have been injured. One did not go home. Two were left with wounds that do not heal fast. These are not numbers. They are lives, broken on the road. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> A 59-year-old woman was killed crossing Kent Avenue. The SUV kept going. A cyclist, 24, was thrown from his bike after a car cut him off. Another cyclist, 39, hit by a sedan, left bleeding in the street. A 53-year-old woman, walking, hit by a car at the crosswalk. The pattern is plain. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They say they are redesigning intersections and lowering speed limits. But in the Navy Yard, the pace is slow. The crashes keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. Laws lapse. Programs expire. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No one should die crossing the street.</strong> The city can act. The council can demand lower speed limits. The mayor can order more cameras and redesigns. Albany can keep the cameras running. But nothing changes unless people demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Four electric scooter riders collided late at night, leaving a trail of blood and fear. The matter, titled '‘Inevitable carnage’: Cyclists shaken after bloody scooter crash on Manhattan Bridge,' highlights the chaos as cyclists and motorized riders share narrow space. Restler stated, 'It's the lack of e-bike infrastructure in New York City that has pushed deliveristas to mopeds.' He called for safer, easier travel for delivery workers and better infrastructure for charging and storage. Restler criticized enforcement stings as ineffective and defended underpaid workers forced into risky conditions by delivery apps. The NYPD and DOT offered no answers. Cyclists and witnesses voiced frustration at the lack of government response.

The redesign, shaped by months of public meetings, aimed to remove a vehicle lane in each direction to add protected bike lanes. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher backed the safety-focused plan. The mayor’s reversal followed pressure from local businesses and the 'Keep McGuinness Moving' campaign. Over 7,000 people signed a petition for the redesign, while about 4,000 opposed it. The official matter summary states: 'Mayor Eric Adams appears to have ordered the city's Department of Transportation (DOT) to reverse course on a planned redesign of McGuinness Boulevard after powerful locals and influential members of the administration voiced their opposition.' The delay means the street remains dangerous for people walking and biking.

The plans, discussed in committee, propose new highway off-ramps on Hicks Street. The matter summary states: 'DOT proposals rely on outdated approaches by building new highway ramps instead of eliminating them.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon criticized the plan for increasing traffic and pollution near homes, urging a new approach: 'They need to go back to the drawing board.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called out the reliance on old infrastructure, saying, 'The proposals should not be doubling down on the infrastructure and transportation of the past.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said, 'They don't improve safety, they don't improve traffic, and they certainly don't improve any of the surrounding communities.' All concepts include a buffered or protected bike lane on Atlantic Avenue, but the impact on vulnerable road users remains uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation defended its proposal to reduce lanes and add parking-protected bike lanes, citing proven safety benefits.
