Two seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, the Brooklyn Navy Yard has seen 102 crashes. Fifty-four people have been injured. One did not go home. Two were left with wounds that do not heal fast. These are not numbers. They are lives, broken on the road. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> A 59-year-old woman was killed crossing Kent Avenue. The SUV kept going. A cyclist, 24, was thrown from his bike after a car cut him off. Another cyclist, 39, hit by a sedan, left bleeding in the street. A 53-year-old woman, walking, hit by a car at the crosswalk. The pattern is plain. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They say they are redesigning intersections and lowering speed limits. But in the Navy Yard, the pace is slow. The crashes keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. Laws lapse. Programs expire. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No one should die crossing the street.</strong> The city can act. The council can demand lower speed limits. The mayor can order more cameras and redesigns. Albany can keep the cameras running. But nothing changes unless people demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution. The program’s future remains uncertain, with vulnerable road users facing continued risk from unchecked car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA warned that without toll revenue, modernization and accessibility projects will be delayed. Advocacy groups and transit riders called the pause a betrayal, emphasizing congestion pricing’s role in funding transit and reducing traffic and pollution.

Debate continues over equity and coverage.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, the City Council passed a resolution urging the state to expand New York City's red light camera program from 150 to 600 intersections. The measure, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows internal debate and negotiation, with some members pushing for 1,325 intersections and others preferring fewer. The final number represents a four-fold increase, covering about 4 percent of city intersections. The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement. The Department of Transportation called the Council's action a critical step.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No real safety net.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) attended a public hearing on the looming G train summer shutdown. The MTA will close the G line in three phases from June 28 to September 2, replacing signals with modern CBTC technology. The matter, titled 'Brooklynites express frustration as G train summer shutdown looms,' drew a packed crowd. Restler said, 'The G train is our lifeline, and for 6 weeks this summer it's gonna be shut down.' Residents and advocates blasted the MTA’s shuttle bus plan as 'absolutely insufficient,' especially for Greenpoint, where the G is the only subway. DOT officials dismissed bus lanes on Manhattan Avenue as unworkable. Cycling improvements remain vague promises. The city’s response leaves vulnerable road users—walkers, cyclists, bus riders—at risk, forced onto crowded streets with little protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The shutdown, for CBTC signal upgrades, will halt service in phases along the Crosstown Line. Restler called the G train a 'lifeline' and warned the shutdown will be a 'huge pain.' The city’s mitigation—free shuttle buses, new bus stops, and parking enforcement—faces sharp criticism. Residents and advocates say the plans are 'absolutely insufficient,' especially for Greenpoint, where the G is the only subway. Calls for dedicated busways and cycling infrastructure have gone unanswered. DOT cites narrow streets and the shutdown’s temporary nature. The community remains deeply dissatisfied, fearing unsafe, crowded streets for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
