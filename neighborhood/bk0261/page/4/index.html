The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No one should die crossing the street.</strong> The city can act. The council can demand lower speed limits.

Parked cars blocked hydrants. Council Member Lincoln Restler’s Intro 80 would let New Yorkers report illegal parking for a bounty. The bill faces delays. Hydrant-blocking drivers keep streets deadly. Enforcement remains weak. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 80, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn), aims to let New Yorkers report drivers who block fire hydrants, bus lanes, and bike lanes, earning a small bounty. The bill was first introduced in 2023, revised, and reintroduced in 2024 with the bounty restored. It has support from 17 Council members and the Brooklyn Borough President, but no hearing yet. The matter summary: 'giving New Yorkers the power to allow residents to write up drivers for parking violations like blocked bus lanes, bike lanes, and fire hydrants.' Restler’s push follows a fatal Brooklyn fire where blocked hydrants delayed rescue. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC calls for 'more pervasive enforcement and higher fines.' Advocates say NYPD enforcement is lax, with 311 complaints often ignored. Hydrant-blocking remains routine, putting vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Footage showed two vehicles sandwiched between the bus and truck, with one car stacked atop another. The injured included a 59-year-old MTA driver, a 33-year-old woman, and a 9-year-old girl. All were hospitalized in stable condition. The cause of the crash was not determined at the time of reporting.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On December 11, 2024, city enforcement of new outdoor dining rules hit Brooklyn’s L’Industrie pizzeria. The policy, set by Mayor Adams and the City Council, bans curbside dining from November 29 through March, returning the space to private car parking. The Department of Transportation warned the pizzeria it could face fines for serving customers from a parked school bus. Council Member Lincoln Restler called it 'unfortunate that city policy returned this curbside space to parking or vehicle storage rather than more dynamic uses like outdoor dining.' Advocates and business owners, including Zafer Sevimcok and Beatrice Tosti di Valminuta, criticized the ban. The number of restaurants in the permanent outdoor dining program has dropped due to fees and winter restrictions. The city’s move prioritizes car storage over safe, public space for people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Robert Holden, claims to address a 'public safety crisis.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the measure, stating, 'The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal [cycling] behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.' Rodriguez cited data: 105 pedestrians killed by cars this year, versus six by e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters combined. He argued that street redesigns, not new bureaucracy, cut deaths and injuries. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams echoed this, noting that registration backers often resist proven safety fixes like protected bike lanes. Rodriguez warned the bill would waste $19 million and slow adoption of sustainable transport. He called for holding delivery apps accountable and redesigning streets, not targeting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They demand a ban on non-essential, luxury air travel.</p><p class=mb3>On December 9, 2024, the city released a draft contract proposing to lift the cap on helicopter flights at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport. The Economic Development Corporation, which manages the heliport, seeks to allow more flights if 50 percent use electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), pending FAA approval. The matter summary states: 'The city could lift a years-old cap on helicopter trips at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in order to get companies to pivot to electric aircraft.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing Brooklyn waterfront neighborhoods, criticized the plan and called for a ban on non-essential tourism and luxury air taxi flights. Restler previously introduced legislation to ban such trips, but it failed. Advocates Melissa Elstein and Andrew Rosenthal of Stop The Chop also oppose the plan, citing noise, quality of life, and expanded luxury service. The contract includes expanded lounges and segregated passenger flows, which advocates see as a move to boost luxury air travel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The meeting addressed complaints about crowds, vendors, and unsafe streets. Restler said, “We’ve got to figure out how to accommodate the people who are visiting, the people who live there and people who work there.” He formally requested a vendor enforcement task force to reclaim pedestrian space. The city is conducting a Department of Transportation traffic study, but residents remain skeptical. The DUMBO Business Improvement District president urged better enforcement of vending laws. Restler’s office is pressing city agencies for action, but stopping the tourist surge is not on the table.
