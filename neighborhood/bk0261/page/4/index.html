Two were left with wounds that do not heal fast. These are not numbers.

The SUV kept going. A cyclist, 24, was thrown from his bike after a car cut him off. Another cyclist, 39, hit by a sedan, left bleeding in the street. A 53-year-old woman, walking, hit by a car at the crosswalk. The pattern is plain. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They say they are redesigning intersections and lowering speed limits. But in the Navy Yard, the pace is slow. The crashes keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. Laws lapse. Programs expire. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No one should die crossing the street.</strong> The city can act. The council can demand lower speed limits. The mayor can order more cameras and redesigns. Albany can keep the cameras running. But nothing changes unless people demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill sits in committee.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1039-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on September 12, 2024. The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to setting maximum amounts for certain member usage fees charged by a bike share operator.' Council Member Chi A. Ossé leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Marte, Hudson, Cabán, Brannan, Hanif, Brewer, and Abreu. The bill would prohibit bike share companies from charging members more than the base subway fare for e-bike rides of one hour or less, or regular bike rides of two hours or less. The law would take effect 120 days after passage and apply to new or renewed contracts. This measure aims to keep bike share affordable for New Yorkers, making cycling a more accessible option.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called the compromise 'a plan that does nothing to address the central safety concerns of our community.'

The incident, caught on camera, showed a Dodge Durango honking, then plowing through metal fences as volunteers dove for safety. The matter centers on repeated illegal parking by NYPD and municipal workers, which blocks safety measures and shrinks space for pedestrians. Restler stated, "It has been really frustrating that our city agencies that should be partners in this effort have undermined it." Kelly Carroll, Executive Director of the Atlantic Avenue BID, added, "We can't even set up a table if the cars are parked there. It renders the open street moot." No arrests have been made, but police are pursuing felony charges. The event exposes systemic failures in enforcement and agency accountability, putting vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The avenue remains a threat to walkers and riders.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced new safety upgrades for Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. The project, not a council bill but a DOT initiative, includes a mid-block crossing, concrete pedestrian islands, and traffic signal tweaks. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi called the changes a boost for safety and growth. Councilman Lincoln Restler and Community Board 2 pushed for more: daylighting, hard barriers, and a full redesign. DOT declined, citing current priorities. Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives called Atlantic Avenue 'one of the most dangerous streets in New York City' and demanded a bold overhaul. Kelly Carroll of the Atlantic Avenue BID said the fixes are 'smart and needed,' but not enough. Over the past decade, 4,414 crashes injured 1,172 people on this 1.3-mile stretch. Advocates warn: without bigger changes, danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Gale A. Brewer, Justin L. Brannan, and Lincoln Restler. Assaults on bus workers reached 76 in 2022 and 70 in 2023. The Council argues that sharing live GPS data will let police and fire locate buses fast during emergencies.

The shutdown forced 160,000 daily riders onto shuttle buses, LIRR, and Citi Bike. The matter, titled 'NYC’s G train shutdown causes longer, pricier commutes for some straphangers,' highlights Restler’s push for a dedicated busway, more ferry service, and expanded Citi Bike access—none of which materialized. Restler said, 'I think we're trying to make the best out of a challenging situation,' but admitted his calls for safer, more reliable alternatives were ignored. Citi Bike fares rose 20%. Riders struggle to find bikes or docks. Public defender Shane Ferro called it a missed chance for protected bike lanes and bus corridors. The city failed to protect vulnerable road users, leaving them exposed to longer, riskier commutes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They protested Governor Kathy Hochul’s June 5 decision to suspend congestion pricing, a move that froze $16.5 billion in MTA upgrades, including elevators for Bed-Stuy’s busy station. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the urgent need for accessibility: 'We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now,' said State Sen. Jabari Brisport. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible. The hold traps thousands—seniors, parents, disabled riders—forcing them to risk dangerous streets or skip transit altogether.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This temporary closure, set through mid-August, aims to ease congestion for shuttle buses during the G train shutdown. The Department of Transportation banned left turns and blocked cars, opening the street to people. Council member Lincoln Restler said, 'Having an alternative use for this space during this period for the G train [shutdown] makes a ton of sense. It gives us an opportunity to see how it goes.' DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno said the closure will 'enhance safety and create new public space.' The North Brooklyn Parks Alliance set up planters to keep cars out. A 2020 crash pushed locals to demand change. Over 2,000 signed a petition for a permanent plaza. The move has growing support, but its future is not yet decided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Cyclists call on DOT to fix ‘chaotic’ Kent Avenue bike lane in Brooklyn,' highlights chaos along the north Brooklyn waterfront. Restler is organizing local businesses to pressure DOT, demanding wider bike lanes and sidewalks, curb separation to block drivers, and safer pedestrian crossings. He says, 'If we really care about cyclists and their safety in New York City, then we should design and implement bike lanes that show it.' DOT spokesperson Will Livingston says the agency is reviewing the proposal but notes the city’s priority is elsewhere. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger: narrow lanes, illegal parking, and forced detours into traffic. No formal bill number or committee stage yet. Restler’s push centers vulnerable road users, demanding the city act before more are hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
