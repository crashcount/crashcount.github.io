Four designs scrap the parking lot, add green space, playgrounds, and a skatepark. Streets may get bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and bus lanes. No timeline yet. The park could finally belong to people.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2024, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler, with business leaders, unveiled proposals to remove the judicial parking lot at Columbus Park. The plan, discussed at a community meeting, would replace the lot with public amenities—open greenery, playgrounds, a skatepark, and restrooms. Architects from WXY presented four designs, all eliminating the judges’ parking. The proposal also calls for safer streets: protected bike lanes on Adams Street, expanded sidewalks, narrowed roads, bus lanes, and possible pedestrianization of Johnson Street. Council Member Restler declared, 'Parks should be for people, not for parking.' Residents voiced support, calling the lot a 'vestige of another era.' The officials will gather more public feedback before submitting a formal proposal. No timeline has been set.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Signals, ramps, and paint force drivers to slow. Pedestrians gain a fighting chance on Brooklyn’s deadliest stretch. Local leaders push for more. The city’s hand finally moves after years of blood.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced new mid-block pedestrian crossings on Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn’s so-called 'Boulevard of Death.' The crossings, between Nevins and Bond, Bond and Hoyt, and Hoyt and Smith streets, add crosswalks, traffic lights, and ramps. Restler said, 'These new mid-block crossings will create a greater sense of safety and community for Boerum Hill.' The Department of Transportation acted after Restler and others demanded change following the death of Katherine Harris, killed by a speeding driver. DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks. Leaders want more: curb extensions, redesigned crossings, and further traffic calming. Atlantic Avenue remains a battleground for the city’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sedan driver, a 44-year-old male occupant, was injured with whiplash and entire body trauma but remained conscious and was not ejected. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Fell Asleep' as contributing factors for the sedan driver. The sedan struck the center back end of the SUV with its center front end, damaging the sedan's right front bumper and the SUV's center back end. Both drivers were licensed and operating their vehicles going straight ahead.

The move shifted Restler, known for championing safe streets, to chair the Governmental Operations, State and Federal Legislation Committee. The matter summary notes Restler's intent to remain active: 'I am reintroducing 501, the citizen reporting bill, and will push as hard as I can to get it over the finish line.' Restler has sponsored bills to curb illegal parking, speed up bike lane installations, and fight placard abuse. Despite his removal, advocates and colleagues, including Jon Orcutt, voiced confidence that Restler will continue to fight for pedestrian and cyclist safety. The committee change may slow progress on key safety bills, but Restler's record and resolve remain strong.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes. The group opposes DOT’s slow pace and reliance on paint, demanding physical barriers. Community board leaders and advocates support the move.
