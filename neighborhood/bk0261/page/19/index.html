The bill required owners of commercial buildings over 500,000 square feet to submit and carry out delivery and servicing plans. The matter summary reads: 'creating an office of sustainable delivery systems and requiring large generator of truck traffic buildings to produce and implement a delivery and servicing plan.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Gutiérrez, Restler, Won, Sanchez, and Cabán. The bill called for on-site loading, delivery reservations, and off-peak scheduling to cut truck traffic and street loading. It would have created a new city office to oversee compliance and penalize violators. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023.

The city’s streets demand it.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2022, Councilman Lincoln Restler (District 33) announced legislation to revoke tens of thousands of personal vehicle parking placards, with exemptions for people with disabilities and those covered by collective bargaining. The editorial, titled 'Free perking: Pull back run amok NYC parking placards,' calls out rampant placard abuse: 'End this scam.' Restler’s companion bill would reward whistleblowers who report cheaters with 25% of fines collected. Both measures have four co-sponsors. The editorial urges the Council to pass the bills and for Mayor Adams to sign them. Placard abuse fuels lawless parking, endangering pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s lack of oversight lets drivers block crosswalks and bike lanes. Restler’s push aims to restore fairness and safety to New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler wants action.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2022, Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) introduced two bills in the City Council. The legislation, now in committee, aims to revoke about 60,000 city-issued parking placards and create a civilian enforcement program. The matter summary states: 'legislation seeks to curb the misuse of parking placards by government employees by revoking thousands of the permits and empowering New Yorkers to report drivers who abuse their parking privileges.' Restler, the sponsor, said, 'We have illegal placard activities on every block, and it actually makes our streets unsafe.' The bills target the rampant abuse that blocks intersections, sidewalks, and bike lanes, especially in Downtown Brooklyn. The civilian enforcement bill would let New Yorkers report violations and collect a share of fines. Transportation advocates back the effort, calling placard abuse 'city-approved corruption.' The legislation seeks to restore safety and access for people on foot, bikes, and transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bills aim to revoke about 60,000 city-issued parking placards and allow civilians to report illegal parking. The legislation, not yet passed or assigned to a committee, is described as a response to 'petty corruption' that endangers pedestrians, people with disabilities, and cyclists. Restler said, 'It is petty corruption and it makes our streets unsafe for a parent walking with a stroller, for a person with a wheelchair, for a cyclist.' The first bill would sharply restrict city agencies from issuing parking permits for private cars, with narrow exemptions. The second would empower civilians to report cars blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants, creating a $175 fine and a reward for reporters. Restler’s district, including Downtown Brooklyn, suffers from rampant placard abuse. The bills seek to reclaim street space and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would revoke all placards for personal vehicles without government plates, except for those granted by collective bargaining or disability. Restler’s proposal, echoing a prior bill from Stephen Levin, would also empower citizens to report placard abuse to the Department of Transportation, triggering civil penalties. The matter summary reads: 'Placard abuse forces neighbors using wheelchairs to navigate unsafe sidewalks, cyclists to go up against oncoming traffic, and parents to push strollers into the street.' Restler, representing Downtown Brooklyn, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint, has refused a placard himself. The bill aims to eliminate roughly 60,000 placards and restore safety and access for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill exempts clergy, people with disabilities, and workers with collectively bargained permits. Restler also backs a measure to pay New Yorkers for reporting illegal parking, including by police. He argues that widespread placard abuse 'makes our streets unsafe.'

Cyclists and walkers have waited too long.</p><p class=mb3>On May 17, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) unveiled a redesign plan for Schermerhorn Street, a notorious crash corridor in Downtown Brooklyn. The plan, presented to the community board, proposes making Schermerhorn one-way between Smith Street and Third Avenue, installing a two-way protected bike lane, and moving the existing painted lane to the south side. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone called it a 'holistic approach to address traffic and bicycle safety.' Council Member Lincoln Restler said, 'Getting this has been a top priority across the district.' Former Council Member Stephen Levin and advocates have long pushed for these changes, especially to stop NYPD from blocking bike lanes. Advocates like Brian Howald and Jon Orcutt stress the need for robust, physical protection—not just paint or flexible posts—to keep drivers out. Since 2015, 555 crashes have injured 124 people and killed one pedestrian on this stretch. The plan aims to end the lawless status quo and protect the most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The roadmap calls for new bike lanes, cleaner buses, and slashed emissions. It aims to cut car pollution, expand green space, and shield neighborhoods from floods. The plan is non-binding but bold.</p><p class=mb3>On May 10, 2022, Councilmember Lincoln Restler of District 33 announced a sweeping climate action roadmap—the first district-level plan in New York City. The proposal, which is non-binding, was not assigned to a council committee but sets a template for local advocacy and funding. The plan’s summary states it will 'address local climate crises by reducing building and vehicular emissions, expanding green space and infrastructure, building storm surge protection, and achieving zero waste.' Restler, the sole sponsor, called for urgent neighborhood action, saying, 'We need to roll up our sleeves and take action at the local level, at the neighborhood level on our blocks.' The plan proposes new bike lanes, electrified school buses, and more renewable energy. Environmental advocates back the approach for its focus on neighborhood needs. While not law, the plan signals a push for safer, greener streets and less car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to amend the city’s administrative code to increase penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles, including those under and over 10,000 pounds, and for unauthorized horns and claxons. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing certain penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles.' Council Member Sandra Ung sponsored the bill, joined by 26 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. There is no evidence the bill would have improved safety for vulnerable road users. The city’s noise problem, and its threat to livable streets, remains unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
