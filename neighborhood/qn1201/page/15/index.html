A jury convicted him this June. At sentencing, Queens DA Melinda Katz said, “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers.” Lee told police he entered the highway wrong‑way “because I wanted to hurt people” and felt “liberated.” He also said, “You want to fight?” He got eight years <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><p>Streets that keep taking</p><p>Crashes in this neighborhood rose this year.

The matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to establish a program to allow community centers, schools, arts and cultural institutions and religious institutions to use adjacent outdoor spaces.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads, joined by Stevens, Restler, Won, and others. The bill has not yet passed. If enacted, it could reclaim space from cars, giving it to people. No formal safety analysis yet, but the measure could mean safer, more vibrant streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
