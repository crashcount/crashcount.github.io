The map and the clock don’t lie.</p><ul><li>In May 2024, a driver’s SUV struck a 56‑year‑old man near 171st St and Hillside Ave. He died at the scene, listed as killed while crossing with no signal or crosswalk, hit by a 2018 Honda going straight east on Hillside <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a>.</li><li>On July 23, 2025, a 16‑year‑old on an e‑bike was hit by a Toyota sedan at 169‑28 Jamaica Ave. Severe leg cuts. The police record says the teen was the bicyclist; the car kept straight west; the bike was merging <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4830557</a>.</li></ul><p>These are not outliers. From 2022 through August 26, 2025, Jamaica logged 2,801 crashes, 1,668 injuries, and four deaths in the dataset’s current rollup <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Pedestrians took 444 injuries and one death; cyclists 94 injuries. Trucks and buses accounted for 19 pedestrian injury crashes, with three serious injuries, a heavy toll for big vehicles in tight streets <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Open Data rollup</a>.</p><p>Hillside. Jamaica Avenue. Names we know.</p><ul><li>Hillside Ave shows up as a top injury site with 38 injuries and two serious injuries; another entry lists 79 injuries and a death along the same corridor <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>.</li><li>Jamaica Avenue logs 126 injuries and one death in the same rollup <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>.</li></ul><p>The pattern is steady. The injuries spike from school let‑out into the commute: 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. is the heavy band, with a peak at 5 p.m. (130 injuries) and another surge in the 8 a.m. hour <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>. Late nights do not spare us: deaths land at midnight, 5 a.m., and two in the 9 p.m. hour <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>.</p><p>What breaks bodies here</p><ul><li>“Other” driver behavior is the largest bucket tied to injuries (741).

No arrests were made that day <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>. NYPD said detectives searched for video and that the man died at Jamaica Hospital <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>NY Daily News</a> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>Five miles away and two years earlier, a Queens man drove the wrong way on the Clearview Expressway and slammed into cars. A jury convicted him this June. At sentencing, Queens DA Melinda Katz said, “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers.” Lee told police he entered the highway wrong‑way “because I wanted to hurt people” and felt “liberated.” He also said, “You want to fight?” He got eight years <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><p>Streets that keep taking</p><p>Crashes in this neighborhood rose this year. Through mid‑August, crashes are up 22% and injuries up 26% versus last year‑to‑date in this same area. Serious injuries rose from one to five in that period comparison <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a>.</p><p>Truck routes, bus lanes, double‑parked cars, delivery chaos—these pages of the ledger don’t capture the horns or the fear. They do show what to fix.</p><ul><li>Harden turns and daylight corners on Hillside Ave and Jamaica Ave. Protect crossings where the bodies pile up <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>.</li><li>Give lead pedestrian intervals and raised crosswalks at the frequent injury hours, especially 2–6 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>.</li><li>Pull heavy vehicles off local streets where possible and enforce truck turning at problem junctions <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>vehicle rollup</a>.</li></ul><p>What leaders have on the table</p><p>Albany moved one tool. The Senate bill to force speed‑limiters on repeat violators advanced in June. Senator Leroy Comrie and Senator Toby Ann Stavisky voted yes in committee on S4045, which would mandate intelligent speed assistance after repeated violations <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S4045</a>.</p><p>At City Hall, a new bill targets unlicensed commuter vans with maximum fines checked line‑by‑line by TLC, NYPD, and DOT. Council Member Nantasha Williams introduced it on Aug. 14, 2025 <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar Int 1347‑2025</a>.</p><p>The city already has authority to lower speeds citywide under Sammy’s Law, and advocates are pressing for a 20 mph default and speed‑limiter mandates for the worst repeat speeders. The path and the asks are laid out here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>What remains is simple and hard: slow the cars, harden the crossings, stop the repeat offenders.</p><p>One more name on Hillside is one too many.</p><p>Action</p><ul><li>Tell your council member and the mayor to use the powers they have. Ask Albany to finish the job on speed‑limiters. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li></ul></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The white Toyota sedan hit an underpass near 225th Street around 3:50 a.m. Both occupants were found outside the wreck when police arrived. Investigators are unsure who was driving at the time of impact: 'Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven't figured out who was driving, police said.' The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive. The article highlights ongoing uncertainty about driver identity and underscores the persistent risks on city highways, especially where loss of vehicle control leads to deadly outcomes.

Senator Andrew Gounardes leads, joined by Leroy Comrie, Michael Gianaris, Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Robert Jackson, Liz Krueger, Zellnor Myrie, Gustavo Rivera, Julia Salazar, Luis R. Sepúlveda, and Toby Ann Stavisky. The bill demands transparency. It would show the public which cars endanger walkers and which spare them.
