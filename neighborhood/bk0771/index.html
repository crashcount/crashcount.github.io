Forty-six injuries. Eighty-one crashes.</strong> These are not just numbers. Each one is a body on the pavement, a life changed, a family waiting by a hospital bed. In the last twelve months, eleven people were injured here. No one died. Not this year. But the line between injury and death is thin. It is luck, not policy, that kept the count at zero.</p><p><strong>Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price.</strong> In the last three years, bikes and cars have collided again and again. A cyclist, age 34, struck by a turning SUV on 5th Avenue. A 20-year-old, head bloodied, after a sedan made a right turn. A woman on an e-bike, thrown from her seat, left with abrasions. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But the speed limit is not yet 20 mph. The city has the power. It has not used it. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Albany lets them expire, then brings them back, then threatens to let them expire again. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p><strong>No one here has died this year.</strong> That is not victory. That is a warning. The next crash could be the one that breaks a family.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit now. It can harden bike lanes. It can protect crossings. It can keep cameras running. <strong>But it will not act unless you force it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand permanent speed cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Fear spreads. Court dates loom. Immigration cases hang in the balance. Council Member Avilés slams the move. Advocates warn: this policy endangers lives and livelihoods.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, the NYPD announced a shift: cyclists, especially delivery workers, now face criminal court summonses for minor traffic violations. The department claims it is responding to e-bike complaints, but has offered no data. Council Member Alexa Avilés (D-Sunset Park) condemned the policy, saying, 'contact with the NYPD is a premise for the deportation pipeline.' She accused Mayor Adams of political maneuvering and failing to address street safety equitably. Lawyers warn that criminal charges can derail immigration cases, exposing workers to ICE. App companies like Uber Eats oppose criminalization, while GrubHub urges legal compliance. Transportation Alternatives launched a petition against the crackdown. The Adams administration also leaked a draft bill to regulate delivery apps, but it has stalled. The new enforcement targets the city’s most vulnerable road users—immigrant cyclists—putting their safety and futures at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, previously endorsed by Community Board 7, would have removed one of three lanes in each direction to add a parking-protected bike lane and shorten pedestrian crossings. Local business groups, including the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation, opposed the redesign, claiming it would disrupt their operations. Board chair Julio Peña criticized DOT for yielding to business interests, saying, 'It reeks of what happened on McGuinness Boulevard.' Council Member Alexa Avilés acknowledged community excitement but stressed the need for consultation. DOT cited 'additional outreach' as the reason for the delay. The area has seen multiple cyclist and pedestrian deaths.

No clear safety gains for walkers or cyclists.</p><p class=mb3>State budget negotiations on March 20, 2025, centered on funding for the MTA. Lawmakers discussed raising the payroll mobility tax on large New York City employers. The measure aims to close a $35 billion hole in the MTA’s five-year capital plan, which covers subway and bus upgrades. The bill has no number yet and remains under negotiation. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, 'The discussion on revenue raisers is definitely going to have to be a part of the MTA.' Senator Steve Chan, District 17, criticized the tax hike, calling it 'a slap on the Brooklyn businesses struggling for survival in my district.' The talks also floated surcharges on for-hire vehicles and online deliveries. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The budget deadline looms.

Residents flooded the city with safety complaints. Trucks menace streets built for people, not freight. Brooklyn and the Bronx bear the brunt. DOT’s response: a feedback portal, microhubs, and pilot programs.</p><p class=mb3>Council Bill 2023, passed last year, orders the Department of Transportation to overhaul New York’s 50-year-old truck route map. The bill, led by Council Member Alexa Avilés, responds to a surge in residential development and e-commerce, which has brought more trucks into neighborhoods like Red Hook and Sunset Park. The DOT’s public feedback map drew over 2,000 comments, with 36 percent citing conflicts between trucks and pedestrians or cyclists. Avilés said, 'I was delighted that DOT could easily acknowledge that this was something we needed to address and was way overdue,' but criticized the city’s 'very passive' engagement. Advocates and residents demand more than online surveys. Environmental justice communities—Hunts Point, Red Hook, Maspeth—face the worst pollution and danger. The city is testing microhubs, off-hour deliveries, and 'Blue Highways' to shift freight off the streets. The redesign aims to cut truck traffic and protect people outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure creates a pilot program to install speed cameras near schools, aiming to catch drivers who exceed posted limits. The authorization for the program expires December 31, 2028. Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push. The vote passed with strong support but faced opposition from several members. The bill’s summary reads: "Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2028." No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the measure targets driver speed in zones where children walk, bike, and cross.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates vow to watch.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2024, the New York City Council and Mayor Adams' administration agreed to pursue regulation of last-mile delivery warehouses. The deal emerged during negotiations over the 'City of Yes for Economic Opportunity' zoning plan, which the Council approved. The matter summary notes, 'the administration has pledged to support future legislation to cut pollution from these warehouses and propose rules to restrict new facilities.' Councilmember Alexa Avilés (District 38) and 28 colleagues sent a letter demanding stricter oversight. Avilés and advocates want special permits and environmental reviews to protect neighborhoods from traffic, pollution, and safety hazards. Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer promised a bill empowering the Department of Environmental Protection to regulate warehouse vehicle emissions. Councilmember Rafael Salamanca Jr. stressed the Council’s leverage: 'It gets to a point where you have to use your power of voting to get the attention of the city.' The City Planning Commission and Council must vote again before rules take effect. Advocates and councilmembers will monitor the administration’s follow-through.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
