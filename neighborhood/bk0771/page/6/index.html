Forty-six injuries. Eighty-one crashes.</strong> These are not just numbers. Each one is a body on the pavement, a life changed, a family waiting by a hospital bed. In the last twelve months, eleven people were injured here. No one died. Not this year. But the line between injury and death is thin. It is luck, not policy, that kept the count at zero.</p><p><strong>Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price.</strong> In the last three years, bikes and cars have collided again and again. A cyclist, age 34, struck by a turning SUV on 5th Avenue. A 20-year-old, head bloodied, after a sedan made a right turn. A woman on an e-bike, thrown from her seat, left with abrasions. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But the speed limit is not yet 20 mph. The city has the power. It has not used it. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Albany lets them expire, then brings them back, then threatens to let them expire again. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p><strong>No one here has died this year.</strong> That is not victory. That is a warning. The next crash could be the one that breaks a family.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit now. It can harden bike lanes. It can protect crossings. It can keep cameras running. <strong>But it will not act unless you force it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand permanent speed cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, not yet numbered, is in early stages. Brewer’s proposal would ban second-hand or refurbished batteries, boost Fire Department outreach, and require delivery apps like Uber and DoorDash to pay for safer batteries. The matter summary warns that a blanket ban 'would worsen the city’s homelessness crisis by forcing residents to choose between a roof over their head and a job, and still not solve the problem of lithium-ion batteries catching fire.' Council Member Alexa Avilés called for a citywide approach. Tenant leader Cynthia Tibbs and Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project also oppose the ban, urging secure charging hubs. Senator Chuck Schumer highlighted federal funding for safer infrastructure. The public can comment on the NYCHA policy until September 6. Advocates argue that bans punish workers and tenants without fixing systemic battery dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver.
