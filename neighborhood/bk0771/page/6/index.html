Forty-six injuries. Eighty-one crashes.</strong> These are not just numbers. Each one is a body on the pavement, a life changed, a family waiting by a hospital bed. In the last twelve months, eleven people were injured here. No one died. Not this year. But the line between injury and death is thin. It is luck, not policy, that kept the count at zero.</p><p><strong>Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price.</strong> In the last three years, bikes and cars have collided again and again. A cyclist, age 34, struck by a turning SUV on 5th Avenue. A 20-year-old, head bloodied, after a sedan made a right turn. A woman on an e-bike, thrown from her seat, left with abrasions. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But the speed limit is not yet 20 mph. The city has the power. It has not used it. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Albany lets them expire, then brings them back, then threatens to let them expire again. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p><strong>No one here has died this year.</strong> That is not victory. That is a warning. The next crash could be the one that breaks a family.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit now. It can harden bike lanes. It can protect crossings. It can keep cameras running. <strong>But it will not act unless you force it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand permanent speed cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They warn free bridges funnel traffic into certain neighborhoods. Their letter calls for fairness. The MTA stays silent. The Traffic Mobility Review Board will decide. Streets hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On July 18, 2023, Council Member Shahana Hanif and other Brooklyn officials called for 'equalized tolling on all crossings into Manhattan' as congestion pricing nears. Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents and advocates cited 13 deaths since 2016, poor infrastructure, constant double parking, and rising truck traffic from last-mile delivery hubs. Damien Andrade called for protected bike lanes. John Delooper pointed to lax enforcement. DOT scheduled a second public workshop for April 27.

The matter summary states DOT must redesign routes to reduce truck traffic in low-income communities of color, where trucks bring pollution, congestion, and road violence. DOT’s Eric Beaton admitted, 'The current situation is already problematic... We want fewer truck miles on our streets.' Aviles, at a City Hall rally, said, 'We must take action.' Advocates like StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure called for strict enforcement and a ban on 53-foot trailers. The Trucking Association of New York supports the redesign and daylighting. The bill responds to a deadly trend: trucks killed 42 people in 2022, with most injuries on truck routes.

The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns.

The matter summary states: 'Pols and advocates are demanding that New York City crack down on last-mile distribution facilities, which are proliferating in low-income communities of color and bringing increased truck traffic, emissions, and dangerous streets.' Aviles, joined by other council members and community advocates, criticized the city’s inaction and highlighted the toll on neighborhoods: delayed traffic studies, rising fatalities, and environmental harm. The coalition calls for a special permit process and zoning reforms to protect vulnerable residents from truck-related danger and pollution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Trucks choke streets in Sunset Park, Gowanus, and beyond. Pollution rises. Noise grows. The council demands permits, studies, and new rules. Amazon shrugs. Residents breathe exhaust.</p><p class=mb3>On February 16, 2023, Council Member Alexa Avilés (District 38) led a legislative push to regulate last-mile warehouses. The bill, now before the council, seeks to amend zoning laws to require special permits for new facilities. The measure aims to stop warehouse clustering near schools, parks, and homes, and mandates studies on truck traffic and air quality. The proposal, described as a response to 'an epidemic of truck traffic,' targets companies like Amazon whose rapid delivery model floods streets with trucks. Avilés declared, 'This is environmental racism. Last-mile facilities follow the same pattern, dumping environmental burdens on low-income communities of color.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez joined, demanding companies 'be responsible, take our communities into account so that we can breathe cleaner air.' The Adams administration expressed concern about economic impacts but supports electrification and cargo bike incentives. The bill awaits committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A6968 would let the Department of Environmental Conservation regulate emissions from last-mile warehouses and require plans to cut transportation pollution, including by using zero-emission vehicles like cargo bikes. The matter summary notes, 'The bills complement each other.' Ramos and Mitaynes sponsor the measures.
