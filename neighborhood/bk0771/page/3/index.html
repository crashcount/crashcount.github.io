Forty-six injuries. Eighty-one crashes.</strong> These are not just numbers. Each one is a body on the pavement, a life changed, a family waiting by a hospital bed. In the last twelve months, eleven people were injured here. No one died. Not this year. But the line between injury and death is thin. It is luck, not policy, that kept the count at zero.</p><p><strong>Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price.</strong> In the last three years, bikes and cars have collided again and again. A cyclist, age 34, struck by a turning SUV on 5th Avenue. A 20-year-old, head bloodied, after a sedan made a right turn. A woman on an e-bike, thrown from her seat, left with abrasions. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But the speed limit is not yet 20 mph. The city has the power. It has not used it. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Albany lets them expire, then brings them back, then threatens to let them expire again. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p><strong>No one here has died this year.</strong> That is not victory. That is a warning. The next crash could be the one that breaks a family.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit now. It can harden bike lanes. It can protect crossings. It can keep cameras running. <strong>But it will not act unless you force it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand permanent speed cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill was introduced December 5, 2024, with Council Member Gale A. Brewer as primary sponsor and Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Julie Won, Julie Menin, Shekar Krishnan, Farah N. Louis, Chi A. Ossé, Nantasha M. Williams, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Carlina Rivera, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams as co-sponsors. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law in relation to the establishment of a task force to study options for making street design and infrastructure safer in consideration of increased use of electric bicycles and related collisions.' The committee laid the bill over on December 11, 2024. The task force, if created, must deliver recommendations for legislation and policy within 270 days. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, e-bike riders—remain at risk while the city studies its next move.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bills aim to close a loophole that lets grocery delivery apps like Instacart avoid paying the $20 per hour minimum wage required for restaurant deliveristas. The matter title: 'Council Seeks To Expand Minimum Wage to Grocery Deliveristas.' The hearing is scheduled for December 9. Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the Immigration Committee, called for broader protections: 'When you become a worker, you should be ensured a living wage.' Ligia Guallpa of Worker’s Justice Project said all delivery workers face significant risks and deserve safety, dignity, and respect. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection supports expanding the wage standard. Instacart opposes the bill. The Council’s action centers gig workers who ride city streets, exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pledge came in a letter from Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer to Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, just before the Council’s Land-Use Committee reviewed the City of Yes for Economic Opportunity zoning change. The city promised to pass legislation within a year to control warehouse emissions and restrict new facilities in low-income areas without review. Council Member Alexa Avilés and activists have long demanded these protections, citing environmental harm and truck traffic. Torres-Springer wrote, 'The city shares the Council's desire to take near-term steps to address the harmful effects of last-mile operations.' The new rules will empower the Department of Environmental Preservation and propose zoning changes, though they are not part of the current zoning plan due to procedural limits.

The project, described as a 'modern maritime port and mixed-use community hub,' aims to overhaul the industrial waterfront with new housing and shipping facilities. Council Member Alexa Avilés, representing District 38, serves as vice chair of the Brooklyn Marine Terminal Taskforce, leading community engagement. The plan includes an $80 million city investment and a $15 million state investment in cold storage to reduce truck traffic. Rep.
