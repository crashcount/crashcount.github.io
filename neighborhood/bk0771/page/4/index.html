Forty-six injuries. Eighty-one crashes.</strong> These are not just numbers. Each one is a body on the pavement, a life changed, a family waiting by a hospital bed. In the last twelve months, eleven people were injured here. No one died. Not this year. But the line between injury and death is thin. It is luck, not policy, that kept the count at zero.</p><p><strong>Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price.</strong> In the last three years, bikes and cars have collided again and again. A cyclist, age 34, struck by a turning SUV on 5th Avenue. A 20-year-old, head bloodied, after a sedan made a right turn. A woman on an e-bike, thrown from her seat, left with abrasions. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But the speed limit is not yet 20 mph. The city has the power. It has not used it. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Albany lets them expire, then brings them back, then threatens to let them expire again. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p><strong>No one here has died this year.</strong> That is not victory. That is a warning. The next crash could be the one that breaks a family.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit now. It can harden bike lanes. It can protect crossings. It can keep cameras running. <strong>But it will not act unless you force it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand permanent speed cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
