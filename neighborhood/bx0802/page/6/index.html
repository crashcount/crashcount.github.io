An SUV turns left. The man does not make it home. In Kingsbridge-Marble Hill, the story repeats. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and six were seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>125 people were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. In the last three years, <strong>five people have died</strong>. <strong>Eight suffered serious injuries</strong>. The wounds do not heal. The dead do not return.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> In this region, SUVs killed two people and caused four serious injuries. Trucks killed one. Cars and sedans left more bodies broken. Buses, mopeds, bikes—they all played their part. But the weight of steel falls hardest from above. Pedestrians at intersections, children in crosswalks, elders with nowhere to run. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law. <strong>The power to lower speed limits is here.</strong> But in Kingsbridge-Marble Hill, the silence is thick. No bold new protections. No flood of safe crossings. No rush to harden bike lanes or slow the traffic that kills. The numbers do not rise. The leaders wait. The blood dries on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice—by a driver, by a planner, by a politician who looks away. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand more cameras, more daylight, more concrete between people and cars. But nothing changes unless you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The move answers NJ’s threat to block data sharing. Without cooperation, speeders dodge camera tickets. Streets stay dangerous. Lawmakers trade barbs. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. On September 28, 2022, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz introduced a proposal in the New York State Legislature. The bill, now in committee, would impose a $50 fee on vehicles registered in states—like New Jersey—that refuse to share driver data for traffic enforcement. The measure responds to a New Jersey Senate bill blocking DMV data sharing, which could undermine New York City’s automated speed camera program. Dinowitz said, 'There's going to have to be a price to pay if my bill passes.' Safe streets advocates and NYC DOT warn that blocking data sharing lets speeders escape penalties, fueling traffic violence. The bill’s text states it 'authorizes the imposition of a $50 fee on vehicles entering NYC which are registered in states which do not cooperate with New York in the enforcement of traffic infractions through the use of photo-monitoring devices or signal monitoring systems.' The fight leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as enforcement gaps let reckless drivers go unpunished.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Eric Dinowitz voiced strong opposition to the DOT’s process, calling it 'undemocratic' and criticizing the lack of community input, though he did not oppose the road diet itself.

Danger stalks city streets, especially near schools.</p><p class=mb3>On May 26, 2022, the New York City Council voted 43-7 to approve Albany’s extension and expansion of the city’s speed camera program. The measure, handled by the Transportation Committee, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7. The matter summary: 'The City Council approved Albany's extension and expansion of New York's speed camera program, allowing cameras to operate 24/7, but not before several council members voiced opposition.' Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers urged action, saying, 'We must use all the tools at our disposal.' Council Members Joan Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and David Carr opposed, calling cameras a financial burden. Eric Dinowitz defended the program: 'If you don't want a speeding ticket, don't speed.' The vote came after a year of high road deaths, with special risk near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by sixteen co-sponsors. The bill would have required the Department of Transportation to install speed humps on all roadways next to parks at least one acre in size, unless the DOT commissioner found installation unsafe or inconsistent with guidelines.
