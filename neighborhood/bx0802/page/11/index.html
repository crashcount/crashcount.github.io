An SUV turns left. The man does not make it home. In Kingsbridge-Marble Hill, the story repeats. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and six were seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>125 people were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. In the last three years, <strong>five people have died</strong>. <strong>Eight suffered serious injuries</strong>. The wounds do not heal. The dead do not return.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> In this region, SUVs killed two people and caused four serious injuries. Trucks killed one. Cars and sedans left more bodies broken. Buses, mopeds, bikes—they all played their part. But the weight of steel falls hardest from above. Pedestrians at intersections, children in crosswalks, elders with nowhere to run. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law. <strong>The power to lower speed limits is here.</strong> But in Kingsbridge-Marble Hill, the silence is thick. No bold new protections. No flood of safe crossings. No rush to harden bike lanes or slow the traffic that kills. The numbers do not rise. The leaders wait. The blood dries on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice—by a driver, by a planner, by a politician who looks away. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand more cameras, more daylight, more concrete between people and cars. But nothing changes unless you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait for you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, presented to Bronx Community Board 8’s Transportation Committee, was rejected in a close vote. Council Member Eric Dinowitz voiced strong opposition to the DOT’s process, calling it 'undemocratic' and criticizing the lack of community input, though he did not oppose the road diet itself. The DOT justified the changes by citing significant crash and injury data, and pointed to successful safety improvements from similar projects elsewhere in the Bronx. Dinowitz stated, 'I have been deeply troubled throughout this process due to the constant misrepresentation of facts and the lack of responsiveness to the community.' Despite local resistance, the DOT moves forward, prioritizing safety on a corridor marked by multiple fatalities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Levine wrote, 'The Hudson River Greenway is one of the most heavily used bike paths in the country... congestion has worsened significantly.' He sent his letter to state DOT Commissioner Therese Dominguez and city DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Local elected officials and Community Board 1, which voted 41-3 in May 2020 to support the change, also back the plan. State senators, assembly members, and council members signed a letter urging the same. Levine and supporters argue the new lane would ease crowding and give e-bike delivery workers—many of them immigrants—a safe, legal route. The state DOT has resisted, citing car congestion.

De La Rosa criticized the Parks Department's 'lack of communication' and pushed for a safer alternative. Community Board 12 and former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz backed a temporary protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway, calling it 'far superior and much safer.'

Cyclists faced a detour onto deadly Broadway. Council Member De La Rosa called the plan reckless. She demanded safer routes. The city now weighs a protected lane on Henry Hudson Parkway. Riders wait. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2022, the Parks Department paused its planned four-month closure of the Hudson River Greenway between West 181st and Dyckman streets. The agency had intended to reroute cyclists and pedestrians onto Broadway, a congested, hazardous road. Council Member Carmen De La Rosa of District 10 intervened, calling the Broadway detour 'pretty crazy' due to heavy traffic and parkway exits. De La Rosa pushed for alternatives, including a temporary protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway, which had support from Community Board 12. The matter, titled 'Parks Dept. Halts Greenway Repair to Mull Creating Safe Detour for Cyclists,' highlights the city’s repeated failure to provide safe detours during greenway closures. Cyclist Allegra Legrande praised De La Rosa’s advocacy and demanded real-time updates and safe routes for vulnerable road users. The project remains on hold as safer options are considered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
