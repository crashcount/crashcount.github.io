An SUV turns left. The man does not make it home. In Kingsbridge-Marble Hill, the story repeats. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and six were seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>125 people were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. In the last three years, <strong>five people have died</strong>. <strong>Eight suffered serious injuries</strong>. The wounds do not heal. The dead do not return.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> In this region, SUVs killed two people and caused four serious injuries. Trucks killed one. Cars and sedans left more bodies broken. Buses, mopeds, bikes—they all played their part. But the weight of steel falls hardest from above. Pedestrians at intersections, children in crosswalks, elders with nowhere to run. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law. <strong>The power to lower speed limits is here.</strong> But in Kingsbridge-Marble Hill, the silence is thick. No bold new protections. No flood of safe crossings. No rush to harden bike lanes or slow the traffic that kills. The numbers do not rise. The leaders wait. The blood dries on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice—by a driver, by a planner, by a politician who looks away. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand more cameras, more daylight, more concrete between people and cars. But nothing changes unless you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait for you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They want eligibility raised to cover families earning up to $60,000. The mayor’s budget keeps funding flat. Riders face higher fares and shrinking options. The fight is urgent.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2023, 29 New York City Council members, led by Carmen De La Rosa, sent a letter to City Hall demanding expanded funding for the Fair Fares program. The letter urges the Adams administration to raise eligibility to 200 percent of the federal poverty line, stating, "We have a moral responsibility to make this essential program available to hundreds of thousands of low-income working families who badly need the savings." The council’s demand comes as the mayor’s preliminary budget keeps Fair Fares funding at $75 million, well below pre-pandemic levels. The council estimates a $61.5 million increase would allow the program to reach far more than the current 280,000 people. De La Rosa and her co-signers argue the current threshold is too low, excluding many struggling families. The push for expansion lands as fare hikes loom and inflation squeezes the city’s poorest riders. The matter is now central to ongoing budget negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, which would grant New York City local control over its speed limits, remains stalled in the Assembly.

Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback.

It was introduced April 11, 2023, and pushed by Council Member Shahana K. Hanif as primary sponsor, with Jennifer Gutiérrez and over twenty others co-sponsoring. The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ ... and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' The SAFE Streets Act package also includes safe passing for cyclists and complete street design mandates. The Council’s action highlights the city’s ongoing fight against reckless driving and the urgent need for stronger protections for people on foot, on bikes, and in cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
