An SUV turns left. The man does not make it home. In Kingsbridge-Marble Hill, the story repeats. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and six were seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>125 people were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. In the last three years, <strong>five people have died</strong>. <strong>Eight suffered serious injuries</strong>. The wounds do not heal. The dead do not return.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> In this region, SUVs killed two people and caused four serious injuries. Trucks killed one. Cars and sedans left more bodies broken. Buses, mopeds, bikes—they all played their part. But the weight of steel falls hardest from above. Pedestrians at intersections, children in crosswalks, elders with nowhere to run. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law. <strong>The power to lower speed limits is here.</strong> But in Kingsbridge-Marble Hill, the silence is thick. No bold new protections. No flood of safe crossings. No rush to harden bike lanes or slow the traffic that kills. The numbers do not rise. The leaders wait. The blood dries on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice—by a driver, by a planner, by a politician who looks away. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand more cameras, more daylight, more concrete between people and cars. But nothing changes unless you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait for you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable road users pay.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2024, the New York City Council and Department of Transportation (DOT) faced off over street safety project implementation. The matter, described as a conflict over 'the implementation of street safety improvements, particularly protected bike lanes and bus lanes,' exposes deep rifts. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez asked council members for input; only six of 51 replied. Council Member Gale Brewer cited ignored past outreach. Joe Borelli dismissed bike lanes and DOT’s efforts. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers insisted the agency, not lawmakers, must pick locations. The city is failing to meet legal benchmarks for new lanes. Mayor Adams has sidelined mandates for community feedback. Advocates blame both the council and mayor for delays, missed projects, and rising danger. Decisive leadership is missing. The city’s legal obligations for street safety remain unmet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan required 80 miles of protected bike lanes and 50 miles of protected bus lanes in the first two years of the Adams administration. DOT delivered only 58.2 miles of bike lanes (72%) and 9.6 miles of bus lanes (19%). Only 68 of 1,000 bus stop upgrades were completed. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, "The Streets Plan is the law, and the Department of Transportation is still failing to fulfill its legal obligations." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the benchmarks "aggressive" but promised to keep trying. Mayor Adams has refused to be bound by the law’s targets. Riders Alliance demanded a real plan for bus lanes. The city’s failure leaves pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers (District 31), chair of the City Council’s Transportation Committee, came under fire after media reports revealed her family car received 25 traffic tickets in 16 months, including 20 for speeding near schools. The controversy centers on officials’ personal compliance with traffic laws while publicly supporting measures like speed cameras and congestion pricing. Brooks-Powers, who has promoted speed cameras and legislation to reward reporting hit-and-run drivers, claims her husband was responsible for the violations and that she has not used the car in over a year. Councilman Robert Holden called her a 'hypocrite,' while safe streets advocate Adam White stressed, 'Public officials and their families need to abide by speed cameras and red lights... people’s lives are at risk.' The incident highlights the gap between public safety advocacy and personal conduct, raising questions about accountability and public trust.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, announced February 12, 2024, would move the plaza from the east to the west side of Bowery at a cost of $56 million. No public design exists yet, and the Department of Transportation (DOT) has not conducted a traffic study. Community outreach is set to begin. Council Member Chris Marte (D-Chinatown) stressed, 'It’s super dangerous to cycle, to walk, and with a rapidly growing aging population, it’s always scary to see aging people walk there with cars.' Marte noted the redesign could reduce traffic confusion. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Improving safety in this area is going to be one of the top priorities.' Despite the intersection’s chaos, city data shows few recent crashes. The city promises to include community suggestions as the process unfolds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support.

No consensus reached.</p><p class=mb3>On January 9, 2024, the Department of Transportation (DOT) hosted a public meeting on the Upper West Side to discuss the 'Smart Curbs' pilot program. The event, held at a W. 84th Street school, was the first outreach for a study on curb management. The DOT described the meeting as a chance to 'help craft a proposal' and denied any plan to eliminate all parking. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We wanted to start here, in this pilot project, listening from the community on how we reimagine the community.' Residents, spurred by misinformation, confronted officials and voiced fears over losing parking. Some, like Andy Rosenthal, supported loading zones. Others, like activist Andrew Fine, rejected the process outright. The meeting highlighted deep divides over curb use, but also the urgent need to address double parking and blocked bike lanes that endanger pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council members and city officials often opposed or delayed these measures, but activists, including Bronwyn Breitner and Ligia Guallpa, kept pressure on.

The matter title asks, 'Who is the Activist of the Year?' and highlights setbacks: 'City Hall canceled bus lanes, scaled back bike lanes and stalled open streets.'

The official summary states: 'The city's redesign of Third Avenue adds a wide protected bike lane and an offset bus lane over 37 blocks.' Despite these changes, advocates and local politicians criticized the plan for leaving three moving lanes and two parking lanes for cars, calling for more sidewalk space and loading zones.

Mayor Adams pledged to clear parking near 1,000 intersections yearly to improve visibility and reduce crashes. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, told the City Council that daylighting 'must be implemented with physical infrastructure in the newly opened space to prevent vehicles from turning more quickly.' Advocacy Director Jon Orcutt of Bike New York dismissed paint-only solutions: 'If it’s just paint in 2023, forget about it.' The article documents rampant illegal parking in painted daylighting zones, often by city vehicles. Advocates argue that only physical barriers—bike racks, boulders, planters—can keep cars out and protect pedestrians. Without them, daylighting is a hollow gesture.

The Department of Transportation will also add raised crosswalks, extended sidewalks, and leading pedestrian signals at 1,000 intersections next year. The city will expand speed restriction technology in its fleet and increase data transparency. Advocates and community boards have long called for these changes.

The project follows years of advocacy, including a 2019 push by then-Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer. Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives praised the concrete curbs and daylighting but warned that gaps remain—especially at confusing intersections and near truck routes. Shepard urged DOT to add more physical barriers and expand the network, noting, 'It’s exciting, but we still need a lot more.'
