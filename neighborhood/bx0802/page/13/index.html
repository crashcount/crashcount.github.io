An SUV turns left. The man does not make it home. In Kingsbridge-Marble Hill, the story repeats. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and six were seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>125 people were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. In the last three years, <strong>five people have died</strong>. <strong>Eight suffered serious injuries</strong>. The wounds do not heal. The dead do not return.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> In this region, SUVs killed two people and caused four serious injuries. Trucks killed one. Cars and sedans left more bodies broken. Buses, mopeds, bikes—they all played their part. But the weight of steel falls hardest from above. Pedestrians at intersections, children in crosswalks, elders with nowhere to run. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law. <strong>The power to lower speed limits is here.</strong> But in Kingsbridge-Marble Hill, the silence is thick. No bold new protections. No flood of safe crossings. No rush to harden bike lanes or slow the traffic that kills. The numbers do not rise. The leaders wait. The blood dries on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice—by a driver, by a planner, by a politician who looks away. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand more cameras, more daylight, more concrete between people and cars. But nothing changes unless you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait for you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocacy Director Jon Orcutt of Bike New York dismissed paint-only solutions: 'If it’s just paint in 2023, forget about it.' The article documents rampant illegal parking in painted daylighting zones, often by city vehicles. Advocates argue that only physical barriers—bike racks, boulders, planters—can keep cars out and protect pedestrians. Without them, daylighting is a hollow gesture.

The Department of Transportation will also add raised crosswalks, extended sidewalks, and leading pedestrian signals at 1,000 intersections next year. The city will expand speed restriction technology in its fleet and increase data transparency. Advocates and community boards have long called for these changes.

The Bronx has lacked a permanent commissioner since November 2021. Salamanca demanded a timeline for filling the role, arguing, "There needs to be a level of accountability and our level of accountability is reaching out to that borough commissioner. Please speed it up." DOT responded that street safety projects are not planned or implemented by borough commissioners, but Salamanca insisted the vacancy leaves the Bronx exposed as crashes and injuries rise.

DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton and Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, refused to provide current figures, promising data next year. Brooks-Powers called this 'unacceptable.' She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency.

The data, analyzed by Transportation Alternatives, covers 4,224 severe injuries from January 2022 to June 2023. In the second quarter of 2023 alone, 784 people—192 pedestrians and 124 cyclists among them—were seriously hurt, up from 718 the year before. The law requiring this data was sponsored by then-Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez. The report’s title calls this a 'preventable public health crisis.' Philip Miatkowski of Transportation Alternatives blames decades of policy that 'prioritize cars over people and leave behind our most vulnerable.' The data shows the Bronx had 23 percent more serious injuries per capita than the city average, Brooklyn 27 percent more, and Manhattan’s cyclist injuries were 77 percent higher per capita.

Rodriguez writes, 'we proposed rules that would expand low or no-emission options for freight deliveries.' He stresses the goal: fewer trucks, safer streets, and more sustainable freight. The statement rebuts industry claims about throttle bans and powered trailer restrictions, clarifying that state law governs those issues. Rodriguez invites public feedback, promising DOT will review all comments before adopting any rule.

Some say it falls short.</p><p class=mb3>On August 29, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced work will begin on the McGuinness Boulevard redesign, known as the 'Calyer Compromise.' The plan, shaped by controversy and negotiation, keeps two lanes of car and truck traffic in both directions from the Pulaski Bridge to Calyer Street during the day, with a flex lane for parking at night. South of Calyer, the road narrows to one lane each way, with protected bike lanes, loading zones, and offset crossings. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the compromise will 'save lives and make this corridor much easier to navigate for everyone, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.' He thanked Mayor Adams, elected officials, and the community for their support. Supporters call it the biggest safety change since Robert Moses widened the road. Opponents, like Keep McGuinness Moving, say it ignores community concerns. The redesign comes after years of advocacy following multiple deaths and injuries on the corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
