A van door swings open. He hits the metal, falls, and a truck crushes him. His name was Georgios Smaragdis. He was 44. He died on the street, his life ended by a door and a wheel. The van driver said, “I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/02/biker-died-manhattan-identified-police/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died</strong> and <strong>three suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>295 crashes. 127 people hurt.</strong> The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-metal-flesh-and-silence>The Pattern: Metal, Flesh, and Silence</h3><p>The dead do not speak. The living try. “I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good,” said a <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>witness on Broome Street</a>.</p><p>Most injuries come from cars and trucks. <strong>Sedans and SUVs hit 31 pedestrians here in three years.</strong> Trucks and taxis follow. Bikes and motorcycles add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The curb is no refuge.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city says it is building more protected bike lanes. It says it is lowering speed limits. It says the numbers are dropping. But on Broome, Centre, Grand, and Lafayette, the blood dries the same. <strong>No new laws or local council action have been announced for this district since the last death.</strong></p><p>The city’s words are soft. The street is hard. The van driver stays. The truck driver stays. The cyclist does not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand protected bike lanes, curbside barriers, and lower speed limits. Demand action, not condolence. <strong>Every day of delay is another chance for the street to take someone else.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The city’s crosswalks remain unchanged.

They argue EVs cut smog, so drivers deserve a break. Critics warn this move keeps streets clogged. Fewer cars mean fewer crashes. The fight pits clean air against crowded roads.</p><p class=mb3>On July 31, 2023, a group of Manhattan elected officials—including Assembly Members Alex Bores, Eddie Gibbs, Deborah Glick, Harvey Epstein, Rebecca Seawright; State Senators Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Liz Krueger, Kristen Gonzalez; and Borough President Mark Levine—sent a letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. They urged a congestion pricing discount for electric vehicles, claiming EVs 'do not contribute significantly to the smog and pollution of the Central Business District.' Assembly Member Bores led the effort, stating, 'when it comes to the environmental case, an electric vehicle is just a different profile than a gas-guzzling one.' The officials oppose credits for bridge and tunnel crossings. Congestion pricing advocates and environmental groups counter that EV discounts undermine the core goal: fewer cars, less traffic, safer streets. They note other cities are ending such breaks. The proposal highlights a tension—cleaner air versus safer, less crowded roads for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights.

Parents can board without folding strollers. Grace Lee, Assemblymember, praised the move. No safety incidents reported. Riders with disabilities keep priority seating. Accessibility grows.</p><p class=mb3>On March 23, 2023, the MTA announced an expansion of its Open Stroller Pilot, aiming to retrofit more than 1,000 buses across 57 routes by fall 2023. The program, described as creating 'a seamless boarding experience for parents,' will allow strollers to remain open on buses, ending the need for parents to fold them before boarding. Assemblymember Grace Lee, representing District 65, voiced strong support, sharing her own struggles as a parent navigating transit with strollers. The expansion follows positive feedback and no reported safety incidents during the pilot’s first phase. The designated stroller spaces will not compromise wheelchair access, ensuring continued priority for riders with disabilities. The move marks a step toward safer, more accessible transit for families and vulnerable riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
