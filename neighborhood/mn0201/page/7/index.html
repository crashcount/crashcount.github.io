Two lives ended in seconds—a woman on a bench, a cyclist passing by. The driver ran. Witnesses shouted for her to stop. She did not. Police found an open bottle of tequila and two pistols in the wreck. The dead: May Kwok, 63, and Kevin Cruickshank, 55. Their names join a long list. Witnesses <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/22/chinatown-hit-run-crash-murder-autumn-donna-ascension-romero-kennedy-lecraft/>tried to stop the driver</a>, but she fled. The street was washed in blood. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=a-pattern-of-harm>A Pattern of Harm</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 3 people have died and 153 have been injured in traffic crashes here.</strong> Cyclists, pedestrians, the old, the young. A cyclist was killed at Centre and Broome. A pedestrian died crossing with the signal at Crosby and Spring. Trucks, SUVs, sedans—they all take their share. The numbers do not rest: <strong>over 1,200 crashes since 2022, 4 dead, more than 500 hurt.</strong></p><p>The violence is not random. It is routine. It is policy. The crash is <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/vigil-held-for-pedestrian-cyclist-killed-in-chinatown-hit-and-run/>raising questions about a bigger safety problem at an intersection of Canal Street</a>. The questions are old. The answers are slow.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Assembly Member Deborah Glick has voted to renew the city&rsquo;s speed camera program and sponsored bills to expand camera enforcement and keep school zones safe. State Senator Brian Kavanagh has voted to curb repeat speeders. These are steps. But the streets remain deadly. The city can lower speed limits now. It has not. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. The benches fill with flowers. The blood dries. The cars keep coming.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-mourning>Call to Action: Demand More Than Mourning</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, redesign the streets, and stop the next crash before it happens. Do not wait for another vigil.

Police did not suspect criminality and declined to specify the medical issue, citing confidentiality. Four additional people refused medical attention.

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.
