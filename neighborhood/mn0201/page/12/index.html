The report, titled 'Slow in the City: Straphangers Campaign reveals the most dawdling, unreliable NYC bus lines,' highlighted severe congestion and unreliable service. Marte urged the city to replicate the 14th Street busway model across Manhattan, stating, 'We don’t have to wait until congestion pricing to take action. We know what works.' The mayor pledged 150 miles of new bus lanes over four years. The MTA and DOT officials acknowledged the need for better enforcement and safer, more efficient bus infrastructure.

Levine said, 'This solution would make this route safer for everybody.' Marte called the current Greenway 'an accident waiting to happen.' The proposal aims to relieve congestion on the Greenway and give e-bikes a safe, legal path. The city’s transportation department is reviewing the idea, but the New York State Department of Transportation, which controls the highway, has not commented.

The bill, now before the City Council, gives the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection power to revoke licenses for deceptive practices. Christopher Marte, another council member, proposed two related bills: one limits delivery backpack weights, the other bans retaliation against workers who refuse unsafe deliveries or miss tight deadlines. Marte’s bill also requires companies promising 15-minute delivery to state that speed is not guaranteed, citing 'the safety of the public and delivery workers.' Menin said, 'These stores are operating in the city in a completely unregulated fashion.' The bills respond to concerns that fast-delivery apps push workers to break traffic laws, endangering pedestrians and cyclists as e-bikes speed through city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children.

Endorsed candidates include Juan Ardilla, Grace Lee, Tony Simone, Anthony Andrews, and Ryder Kessler, all praised for prioritizing vulnerable road users. StreetsPAC calls for reforms like protected bike lanes, dedicated busways, and DMV accountability. Their endorsements aim to shift city policy toward pedestrian and cyclist safety, away from car-centric streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Fifty-nine killed by cars in three months. Streets favor SUVs over people. Full-time speed cameras help, but car subsidies fuel the carnage. Ryder Kessler calls for bold action: end giveaways, reclaim space, protect the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2022, Ryder Kessler published an opinion piece urging New York to stop subsidizing car usage. The statement, titled 'New York Must Stop Subsidizing Car Usage,' highlights a 44 percent rise in traffic fatalities and criticizes the city’s car-centric policies. Kessler, a candidate for Assembly District 66, calls out incumbent Deborah Glick for supporting speed-camera renewal but failing to reduce car dominance. He states, 'To get cars off the streets, we have to stop subsidizing their usage.' Kessler pledges to expand protected bike and bus lanes, end free curbside parking, and push for weight-based vehicle fees. He argues that current subsidies—free parking, gas-tax holidays, and slow-walked congestion pricing—endanger New Yorkers, especially those outside cars. The piece demands systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
