Two lives ended in seconds—a woman on a bench, a cyclist passing by. The driver ran. Witnesses shouted for her to stop. She did not. Police found an open bottle of tequila and two pistols in the wreck. The dead: May Kwok, 63, and Kevin Cruickshank, 55. Their names join a long list. Witnesses <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/22/chinatown-hit-run-crash-murder-autumn-donna-ascension-romero-kennedy-lecraft/>tried to stop the driver</a>, but she fled. The street was washed in blood. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=a-pattern-of-harm>A Pattern of Harm</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 3 people have died and 153 have been injured in traffic crashes here.</strong> Cyclists, pedestrians, the old, the young. A cyclist was killed at Centre and Broome. A pedestrian died crossing with the signal at Crosby and Spring. Trucks, SUVs, sedans—they all take their share. The numbers do not rest: <strong>over 1,200 crashes since 2022, 4 dead, more than 500 hurt.</strong></p><p>The violence is not random. It is routine. It is policy. The crash is <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/vigil-held-for-pedestrian-cyclist-killed-in-chinatown-hit-and-run/>raising questions about a bigger safety problem at an intersection of Canal Street</a>. The questions are old. The answers are slow.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Assembly Member Deborah Glick has voted to renew the city&rsquo;s speed camera program and sponsored bills to expand camera enforcement and keep school zones safe. State Senator Brian Kavanagh has voted to curb repeat speeders. These are steps. But the streets remain deadly. The city can lower speed limits now. It has not. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. The benches fill with flowers. The blood dries. The cars keep coming.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-mourning>Call to Action: Demand More Than Mourning</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, redesign the streets, and stop the next crash before it happens. Do not wait for another vigil.

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
