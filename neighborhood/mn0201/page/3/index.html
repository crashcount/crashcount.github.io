He died at the scene. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>The clock tells a story. Injuries spike through the late morning and evening rush: 10 a.m. shows three deaths and 18 injuries in this area.

The city promised quick fixes at that intersection and a longer redesign. “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Advocates warned most of Canal stays dangerous. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>, <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</p><p>Closer in, the deaths feel routine.

Two deaths sit under “other.” Failure to yield injured seven and seriously hurt one. Unsafe speed shows a serious injury.

Pull back parking to give sightlines and space.</li><li>Harden left turns at signals with rubber islands and slow‑turn geometry.</li><li>Add leading walk signals and tighten truck turns at freight routes.</li></ul><p>City Hall moves when the dead make headlines. After the Canal killings, the city said it would lower speeds, add barriers, and narrow lanes at Bowery and Canal. “We are taking immediate steps,” Rodriguez said. “The vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly,” an advocate answered. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>, <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</p><p>Two citywide moves sit on the table now. Albany renewed 24/7 school speed cameras through 2030. Supporters say they cut speeding. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>.</p><p>And the state is advancing a bill to force speed‑limiters on repeat speeders. Senator Brian Kavanagh voted yes in committee. The bill targets drivers with patterns of points or camera tickets. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>.</p><p>Lower the default speed. Install the limiters.

The article details heated opposition from local residents and bus riders, who argued the plan was rushed and lacked proper traffic analysis. Stacy Rauch, a daily bus rider, said, 'The bigger problem is we don’t have enough buses.' Critics worried diverted car traffic would overwhelm nearby streets. The city compared the move to the 14th Street car ban, but residents noted differences in bus frequency. The article highlights accusations of conflicts of interest involving community board members and advocacy groups. The policy aims to prioritize buses and vulnerable road users, but leaves open questions about implementation and neighborhood impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents fear traffic will flood side streets. Bus riders crawl at five miles an hour. Officials tout safety gains from 14th Street. Tension rises between speed, safety, and neighborhood calm.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (2025-06-08) reports that the city proposes restricting cars on 34th Street to create a busway between 3rd and 9th Avenues. Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It fixes technical errors. It repeals old rules. Streets near schools stay watched. Drivers face checks. Kids walk safer.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A 8787, sponsored by Deborah Glick, is in the sponsorship stage. The bill, titled 'Extends provisions and makes technical corrections to school speed zones in NYC; repeals certain provisions relating thereto,' was introduced on June 5, 2025. Glick leads the push to keep speed zones near schools, correcting past errors and removing outdated rules. The bill remains under committee review. No safety analyst note was provided, but the measure aims to keep enforcement strong around schools. Vulnerable road users—children—stay in focus.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
