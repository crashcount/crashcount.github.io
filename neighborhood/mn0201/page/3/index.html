A van door swings open. He hits the metal, falls, and a truck crushes him. His name was Georgios Smaragdis. He was 44. He died on the street, his life ended by a door and a wheel. The van driver said, “I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/02/biker-died-manhattan-identified-police/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died</strong> and <strong>three suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>295 crashes. 127 people hurt.</strong> The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-metal-flesh-and-silence>The Pattern: Metal, Flesh, and Silence</h3><p>The dead do not speak. The living try. “I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him.

The curb is no refuge.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city says it is building more protected bike lanes. It says it is lowering speed limits. It says the numbers are dropping. But on Broome, Centre, Grand, and Lafayette, the blood dries the same. <strong>No new laws or local council action have been announced for this district since the last death.</strong></p><p>The city’s words are soft. The street is hard. The van driver stays. The truck driver stays. The cyclist does not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.
