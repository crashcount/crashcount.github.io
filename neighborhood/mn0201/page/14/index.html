A van door swings open. He hits the metal, falls, and a truck crushes him. His name was Georgios Smaragdis. He was 44. He died on the street, his life ended by a door and a wheel. The van driver said, “I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/02/biker-died-manhattan-identified-police/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died</strong> and <strong>three suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>295 crashes. 127 people hurt.</strong> The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-metal-flesh-and-silence>The Pattern: Metal, Flesh, and Silence</h3><p>The dead do not speak. The living try. “I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good,” said a <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>witness on Broome Street</a>.</p><p>Most injuries come from cars and trucks. <strong>Sedans and SUVs hit 31 pedestrians here in three years.</strong> Trucks and taxis follow. Bikes and motorcycles add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The curb is no refuge.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city says it is building more protected bike lanes. It says it is lowering speed limits. It says the numbers are dropping. But on Broome, Centre, Grand, and Lafayette, the blood dries the same. <strong>No new laws or local council action have been announced for this district since the last death.</strong></p><p>The city’s words are soft. The street is hard. The van driver stays. The truck driver stays. The cyclist does not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand protected bike lanes, curbside barriers, and lower speed limits. Demand action, not condolence. <strong>Every day of delay is another chance for the street to take someone else.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, still in early stages, aims to ban advertising of rapid delivery times. The matter summary reads: 'ban apps from advertising quick delivery times, arguing they encourage delivery workers to break traffic laws and endanger themselves and pedestrians.' Brewer also pressed for enforcement against 'dark stores' operating in retail zones. She criticized Gorillas' changes as cosmetic, saying, 'They're doing this just to conform [to zoning rules] but it's not really their model.' Councilman Christopher Marte is leading the bill. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the council’s focus is clear: speed kills, and zoning violations breed chaos.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states the bill 'would bar on-demand grocery apps from advertising 15-minute delivery times, citing threats to worker and pedestrian safety.' Marte, representing District 1, argues that these ads pressure delivery workers on e-bikes and scooters to break traffic laws, endangering themselves and pedestrians. 'We don’t think that should be legal,' Marte said. He believes giving workers more time will save lives by reducing the rush.

Council members Julie Menin and Christopher Marte raised concerns about noise, garbage, and parking loss. Livable streets groups, including Open Plans and Transportation Alternatives, supported curbside fees and called for an Office of Public Space Management.

The matter, titled 'Hearing Day: Could Fees for Outdoor Dining Lead to Proper Pricing of City’s Curbs?', was discussed in committee. Council Member Julie Menin, representing District 5, participated and voiced concerns about noise, garbage, and parking loss. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez explained that fees would depend on location and space size. Advocates like Sara Lind and Marco Conner DiAquoi argued for equity, noting, 'Seventy-five percent of our public curb space is devoted to the movement and storage of vehicles.' The hearing highlighted calls for better public space management and a dedicated oversight office. Community boards remained divided, citing nightlife and local control issues. The debate centered on reclaiming curb space from cars and making the city safer and fairer for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
