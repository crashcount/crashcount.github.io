Over six hundred injured.</strong> That is the toll in Castle Hill-Unionport since 2022. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. A 64-year-old man, crossing at Bruckner and Castle Hill, struck by an SUV. A 19-year-old, dead on the Bruckner Expressway. A 62-year-old woman, killed in a crosswalk by a turning SUV. These are not accidents. They are collisions, each one a life ended or broken. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data confirms it</a>.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, workers. In the last year alone, ninety people were injured on these streets. Not one serious injury was counted as &ldquo;preventable&rdquo;—but every one was. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the harm.</strong> Three of the four deaths came from SUVs or cars. Trucks, buses, and bikes trail far behind in the body count. The streets are built for speed and size, not for the people who walk them. The numbers are plain: cars and trucks are the threat. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The data is clear</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-absence>Leadership: Action or Absence?</h3><p><strong>What has changed?</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law, allowing New York to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Castle Hill-Unionport, the pace of change is slow. The deaths keep coming. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise. No new redesigns. No bold votes. No public reckoning. The streets remain the same.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, by leaders, by those who set the rules and draw the lines. <strong>Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand street redesigns. Demand action.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

The portal lets users pinpoint and describe street obstructions. Councilmember Amanda Farías of District 18, who is mentioned in connection with the launch, stated, 'Double-parking is a chronic issue throughout our city, and is one of the largest quality of life issues facing my district everyday.' She added, 'It is not only illegal to double-park your car, but it puts others in danger when neighbors are unable to cross traffic safely, congestion is added to our streets, crossways and bike lanes are blocked, and emergency vehicles cannot respond in time.' The portal aims to collect data on dangerous spots, focusing city attention on hazards that threaten pedestrians, cyclists, and emergency response.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
