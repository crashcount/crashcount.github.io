Nine left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 700 hurt since 2022. The wounds are not just numbers. They are heads split open, legs crushed, lives ended at the curb. A 62-year-old woman, crossing at Seward and Olmstead, struck down by an SUV making a left turn. She never made it to the other side. The driver failed to yield. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Just days ago, a 55-year-old woman was hit by a truck while crossing Quimby and Havemeyer.

Trucks and buses have left two with serious injuries. Bikes and mopeds are in the mix, but the carnage comes on four wheels, not two. The sidewalk is no refuge. The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Local leaders have not been silent. Assembly Member Karines Reyes co-sponsored a bill to hold vehicle owners liable for violations caught on camera, aiming to stop the worst repeat offenders. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A5440&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored a bill</a> State Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a measure to force speed limiters on the most dangerous drivers. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a> These are steps forward. But the deaths keep coming. The streets do not wait for Albany.</p><h3 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h3><p>After a crash in Co-op City, a witness <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said</a>, <strong>&ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground.

The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.
