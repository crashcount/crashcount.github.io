A 62-year-old woman, crossing at Seward and Olmstead, struck down by an SUV making a left turn. She never made it to the other side. The driver failed to yield.

Trucks and buses have left two with serious injuries. Bikes and mopeds are in the mix, but the carnage comes on four wheels, not two. The sidewalk is no refuge. The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Local leaders have not been silent.
