But the blood still runs. In the last twelve months, there were 29 injuries and 1 serious injury from crashes. No one walks away from a crash the same. The numbers are small, but the pain is not. A shoulder torn. A neck snapped. A back in shock. The wounds are listed in the city’s ledgers, but the lives behind them are not counted.</p><h3 id=the-beating-that-broke-the-silence>The Beating That Broke the Silence</h3><p>On May 16, Diana Agudela, a 44-year-old e-bike commuter, was attacked on her way home. She was left with brain injuries, not expected to survive. Her daughter stood in the dark and said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>&ldquo;We need more protection, we need more lights. It is ridiculous that the park that my mom would ride from to go from work to home had no lights and no cameras.&rdquo;</a> The path was black, empty, and unguarded. The city left her alone.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-gaps>Leadership: Promises and Gaps</h3><p>No deaths. But no real safety. The city touts Vision Zero and new laws. But on Randall’s Island, the basics are missing. No lights. No cameras. No protection for the people who walk or ride home late. The numbers show a rise: crashes up 291% year over year. Injuries up 300%. Still, the silence from local leaders is louder than the sirens.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. The city can light the paths. The city can install cameras. The city can slow the cars. But only if you force them. Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for another mother to be left in the dark.</p><p>Contact your local leaders. Demand lights, cameras, and real protection for every person on Randall’s Island.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Twenty-five lost since January. Most killed on streets without protection. Council Member Brooks-Powers calls for urgent investment in safer roads, especially in outer boroughs. Activists demand the city build protected bike lanes now. Promises have failed. Lives are lost.</p><p class=mb3>On October 17, 2023, Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31) highlighted the deadly toll facing cyclists in New York City. The event, covered by amny.com, cited a study showing 25 bike riders killed since January, making this the deadliest year for cyclists since 1999. The matter summary states: 'New York City is on pace to see the deadliest year for bike riders since 1999.' Brooks-Powers stressed the urgent need for investments in street infrastructure, especially in outer-borough communities. She joined advocates and fellow Council Member Diana Ayala in demanding the city fulfill legal requirements to build safe streets. The analysis found 94% of cyclist deaths occurred on streets without protected bike lanes. Activists and analysts called for immediate action to fast track the NYC Streets Plan and expand protected lanes, noting that only 3% of city streets have them, despite an 18.1% drop in injuries and deaths where they exist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They argue EVs cut smog, so drivers deserve a break. Critics warn this move keeps streets clogged. Fewer cars mean fewer crashes. The fight pits clean air against crowded roads.</p><p class=mb3>On July 31, 2023, a group of Manhattan elected officials—including Assembly Members Alex Bores, Eddie Gibbs, Deborah Glick, Harvey Epstein, Rebecca Seawright; State Senators Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Liz Krueger, Kristen Gonzalez; and Borough President Mark Levine—sent a letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. They urged a congestion pricing discount for electric vehicles, claiming EVs 'do not contribute significantly to the smog and pollution of the Central Business District.' Assembly Member Bores led the effort, stating, 'when it comes to the environmental case, an electric vehicle is just a different profile than a gas-guzzling one.' The officials oppose credits for bridge and tunnel crossings. Congestion pricing advocates and environmental groups counter that EV discounts undermine the core goal: fewer cars, less traffic, safer streets. They note other cities are ending such breaks. The proposal highlights a tension—cleaner air versus safer, less crowded roads for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
