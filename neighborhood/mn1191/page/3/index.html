But the blood still runs. In the last twelve months, there were 29 injuries and 1 serious injury from crashes. No one walks away from a crash the same. The numbers are small, but the pain is not. A shoulder torn. A neck snapped. A back in shock. The wounds are listed in the city’s ledgers, but the lives behind them are not counted.</p><h3 id=the-beating-that-broke-the-silence>The Beating That Broke the Silence</h3><p>On May 16, Diana Agudela, a 44-year-old e-bike commuter, was attacked on her way home. She was left with brain injuries, not expected to survive. Her daughter stood in the dark and said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>&ldquo;We need more protection, we need more lights. It is ridiculous that the park that my mom would ride from to go from work to home had no lights and no cameras.&rdquo;</a> The path was black, empty, and unguarded. The city left her alone.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-gaps>Leadership: Promises and Gaps</h3><p>No deaths. But no real safety. The city touts Vision Zero and new laws. But on Randall’s Island, the basics are missing. No lights. No cameras. No protection for the people who walk or ride home late. The numbers show a rise: crashes up 291% year over year. Injuries up 300%. Still, the silence from local leaders is louder than the sirens.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. The city can light the paths. The city can install cameras. The city can slow the cars. But only if you force them. Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for another mother to be left in the dark.</p><p>Contact your local leaders. Demand lights, cameras, and real protection for every person on Randall’s Island.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The 27-year-old victim, shot in the torso, crashed his red Hyundai into a stop sign at Southern Blvd. and Garden St. before calling a cab to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he died. A deli worker described, 'There were a whole lot of rounds... It was like a movie.' The other driver, in a black Honda CR-V, fled the scene.

The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation. The case raises questions about police pursuit tactics and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike. The bill has not yet received a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Diana I. Ayala is the primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors including De La Rosa, Banks, Ossé, Marte, and others. The bill was laid over by committee on February 10, 2025. The measure would take effect immediately if passed. By capping required coverage, the bill may leave crash victims with less compensation after collisions involving TLC-licensed vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project had paused after Hochul halted congestion pricing, leaving a $15 billion gap in the MTA’s budget. State Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Jeremy Cooney said, "I continue to believe this is an issue that can’t wait until next year’s session." The legislature ended its session without a plan to replace lost toll revenue. Hochul promised to address the shortfall in the 2025 budget. Assemblyman Eddie Gibbs praised Hochul’s commitment to East Harlem, while Rep. Adriano Espaillat thanked her for the funding. Critics warned the $54 million is a drop in the bucket. The MTA’s $70 billion capital plan hangs in the balance. No immediate relief for transit riders or vulnerable road users. The system remains at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure creates a pilot program to install speed cameras near schools, aiming to catch drivers who exceed posted limits. The authorization for the program expires December 31, 2028. Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push. The vote passed with strong support but faced opposition from several members. The bill’s summary reads: "Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2028." No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the measure targets driver speed in zones where children walk, bike, and cross.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
