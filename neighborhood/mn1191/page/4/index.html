One was hurt so badly they may never walk the same.</strong> Not one death, but the luck feels thin. The pain is spread across ages—children, the old, the young in their prime. No one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The wounds come from all sides. <strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> A sedan put a pedestrian in the hospital. Trucks, bikes, mopeds—they all move through, but it’s the big machines that leave the deepest marks.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>There are no headlines here. No front-page stories. Just the quiet grind of bodies broken and lives changed. A 76-year-old woman, hit on the bridge, left with internal injuries. A 41-year-old man, neck snapped in a crash, left conscious but changed. A 33-year-old, shocked and hurt, seatbelt digging into his chest. These are not numbers. They are people who woke up expecting an ordinary day.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Council Member Diana Ayala has voted for bills to clear abandoned cars and repaint pavement, and co-sponsored a law to keep crosswalks clear.</strong> She backed a push to force the city to daylight 1,000 intersections a year, to stop drivers from hiding behind parked cars. But the bill <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>sits in committee</a>. The city moves slow. The danger does not.</p><p><strong>State Senator Jose Serrano voted yes on bills to create safety zones and curb repeat speeders.</strong> He backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst drivers to install speed limiters. The votes are on record. The streets are not yet safe.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>Every injury here could have been prevented.</strong> Every delay is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand action, not excuses.</strong></p><p>The next crash is coming. The only question is who will pay.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The suit claims, 'the city maintains a policy and practice of detaining, ticketing, and prosecuting cyclists who lawfully ride through an intersection when the pedestrian control signal indicates white/walk.' Esparza received a $190 summons at Third Avenue and East 42nd Street, Manhattan, despite acting within the law. The lawsuit names current and former NYPD commissioners, accusing them of knowingly violating civil rights. The article notes a sharp rise in tickets for cyclists in early 2025.

Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.
