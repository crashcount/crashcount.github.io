But the street does not rest. In the last twelve months, 20 people were hurt. One was left with wounds the city calls serious. A leg crushed. Blood on the pavement. A man crossing with the light, struck by a moped. An older woman, bleeding from the head, hit by a truck that did not yield. The numbers do not flinch: 92 crashes since 2022. No deaths. But pain, always pain. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Pedestrians and riders take the blows. Trucks, SUVs, sedans, mopeds—they all find flesh. In the last year, a moped ran down a man in the crosswalk. A truck hit a woman crossing without a signal. An SUV left two with broken bodies. The street is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They count the dead. They promise change. They passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York set its own speed limits. But in Crotona Park, the speed stays the same. Cameras catch speeders, but only where the city puts them. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The council could bring it back. They have not. The mayor says one death is too many. But the street keeps taking.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash can be stopped. Lower the speed. Build real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Bring back the laws that hold reckless drivers to account. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to act. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p>Demand action. Demand safety. The street belongs to the living.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill was discussed at a City Council hearing on February 1, 2024. The Adams administration, represented by DOT officials Margaret Forgione and Will Carry, voiced strong support, citing 'public safety risks posed by growing risks of uncertified e-bike batteries.' The bill aims to help delivery workers transition to legal, safe devices and address both street and fire safety. Last year, 18 people died in 268 lithium-ion battery fires. Delivery companies like Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub oppose the bill, claiming it could lead to fraud and fail to solve the battery crisis. Workers' advocates back the bill but demand protections against retaliation, noting certified batteries are expensive and scarce.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan promised faster commutes for tens of thousands. Instead, Feliz and Bronx power brokers pushed a weak compromise: repainting the lane and expanding bus lane cameras. The matter summary states, 'Feliz has been a staunch opponent of the Department of Transportation's plan to improve the existing Fordham Road bus lane.' Feliz’s Honda Accord was cited three times for bus lane violations, including twice on Fordham Road, and six times for speeding in school zones since 2020. He claimed the car was 'shared.' Bus speeds barely improved, rising from 6 to 6.3 mph—still below the Bronx average. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain at risk.

Key projects, including bike lanes on McGuinness Boulevard and Ashland Place, and bus lanes on Fordham Road, were stalled or abandoned.

Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and other members voiced frustration but admitted limited power to enforce compliance. Council Member Chi Ossé was mentioned in coverage. Without mayoral commitment, the plan’s promise to protect vulnerable road users remains unfulfilled.

The law aims to protect delivery workers and consumers from battery fires. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Marjorie Velazquez back new bills requiring app-based delivery companies to provide safe e-bikes and batteries. Velazquez called the bill a 'key' step for safety. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project testified that certified batteries are too expensive and in short supply. Delivery workers, facing high costs and legal threats, often keep using unsafe batteries or turn to gas-powered mopeds. App companies resist, citing worker status and costs. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection has started enforcement, but the core danger persists: safe batteries are out of reach for many, leaving workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, once promised by the mayor, would have installed offset bus lanes. Instead, the Department of Transportation will only repaint existing lanes and consider more automated enforcement. The move came after opposition from Council Member Oswald Feliz, Belmont BID Chair Peter Madonia, Rep. Adriano Espaillat, and local institutions. The official matter: 'Adams administration is abandoning plans for major improvements to bus infrastructure on Fordham Road.' DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno confirmed, 'we are repainting curbside bus lanes and continuing automated bus lane enforcement.' Advocates and MTA officials condemned the reversal, noting that most shoppers and visitors arrive by transit or on foot. The city missed its legal bus lane targets last year.

The bill responds to ongoing violations of Local Law 39, which bans uncertified batteries not approved by UL Solutions. Despite this, online retailers like Amazon continue to sell these dangerous products. The matter summary states: 'Online retailers such as Amazon are selling illegal, uncertified lithium-ion batteries and mopeds to New York City residents, despite city laws prohibiting such sales.' Feliz’s proposal aims to close enforcement gaps and protect delivery workers, who often rely on cheap, unsafe batteries. Lawmakers also approved a citywide buy-back program for faulty batteries. Rep. Ritchie Torres introduced federal legislation to set safety standards and hold online marketplaces accountable.

The main bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, creates a city-funded buy-back program for delivery workers to exchange faulty batteries and devices for safe, certified ones. The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted.
