But the street does not rest. In the last twelve months, 20 people were hurt. One was left with wounds the city calls serious. A leg crushed. Blood on the pavement. A man crossing with the light, struck by a moped. An older woman, bleeding from the head, hit by a truck that did not yield. The numbers do not flinch: 92 crashes since 2022. No deaths. But pain, always pain. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Pedestrians and riders take the blows. Trucks, SUVs, sedans, mopeds—they all find flesh. In the last year, a moped ran down a man in the crosswalk. A truck hit a woman crossing without a signal. An SUV left two with broken bodies. The street is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They count the dead. They promise change. They passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York set its own speed limits. But in Crotona Park, the speed stays the same. Cameras catch speeders, but only where the city puts them. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The council could bring it back. They have not. The mayor says one death is too many. But the street keeps taking.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash can be stopped. Lower the speed. Build real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Bring back the laws that hold reckless drivers to account. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to act. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p>Demand action. Demand safety. The street belongs to the living.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Primary sponsor Luis R. Sepúlveda (District 32) and co-sponsor Joseph P. Addabbo Jr. (District 15) back the measure.

The program, praised by Council Member Oswald Feliz, allows 400 delivery workers to exchange uncertified, fire-prone bikes for certified, street-legal models. The law followed a spike in lithium-ion battery fires—277 in 2024, killing six. The $2 million program offers bikes and spare batteries, but only scratches the surface for the city’s estimated 80,000 delivery workers. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called the effort a step toward safer, cleaner mobility. Applications close February 17.

The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear.

Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage. Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes.

The proposal was presented to the Municipal Services Committee of Bronx Community Board 5. DOT’s plan, first floated in June 2024, restricts the 0.6-mile stretch to buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter summary notes, 'Bronx bus riders are about to get a short stretch of relief.' Council Member Oswald Feliz represents the district but has not publicly supported or opposed this project. Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson, however, called for better bus service, stating, 'We need better buses to move across our borough from east to west.' DOT’s outreach found most shoppers and workers use transit or walk, not drive. The agency chose not to remove parking, responding to business concerns. The busway aims to speed up the Bx36, the Bronx’s fifth-busiest bus, and serve a low-income, car-free majority.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
