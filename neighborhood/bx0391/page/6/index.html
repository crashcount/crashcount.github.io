Same corner. Same story.</p><p>—</p><p><strong>Who’s responsible for fixing this?</strong></p><p>Eighty‑five thousand Bronx bus riders were told they mattered on Fordham Road. “<strong>We can&rsquo;t deemphasize and under‑prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx</strong>,” said the MTA’s Janno Lieber, pressing the city to hold the line on bus priority (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/07/20/mtas-hope-for-eric-adams-stay-with-us-on-fordham-road>Streetsblog</a>). Council Member <a href=/council-district/15/>Oswald Feliz</a> opposed that plan, according to that report.</p><p>In Albany, State Senator <a href=/senate-district/32/>Luis Sepúlveda</a> <strong>co‑sponsored</strong> and voted yes on the bill to install speed‑limiting tech on repeat speeders (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>). He also signed on to expand camera enforcement and go after plate obstruction (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>S 7336</a>).</p><p>At a 2023 rally for Sammy’s Law, Families for Safe Streets demanded a vote to let the city set safer speeds. Some lawmakers hesitated — including <a href=/assembly-district/79/>Chantel Jackson</a> — citing constituent feedback (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/05/supporters-of-sammys-law-rally-heastie-and-share-frustrations-about-assemblys-inaction-on-speed-limit-reduction>Streetsblog</a>). The families are still waiting.</p><p>—</p><p><strong>The fixes sit on the table</strong></p><p>Here, the worst harm clusters at a few corners and hours. The crash sheets name the problems: <strong>failure to yield</strong> at turns, <strong>unsafe speed</strong>, and <strong>heavy vehicles</strong> taking the inside line. The tools are not mysteries.</p><ul><li>Daylight every leg of Claremont Pkwy and Crotona Ave. Harden the turns. Give a long <strong>leading pedestrian interval</strong> at both corners (NYC Open Data: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>collisions</a>).</li><li>Put a truck turn‑calming treatment at East 175th and Waterloo, where a right‑turning truck left a pedestrian bleeding (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4550126</a>).</li><li>Aim enforcement and cameras at the evening peak along Crotona Ave. The pattern is there in the hours (NYC Open Data: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>collisions</a>).</li></ul><p>Citywide, two steps would cut the danger that reaches this neighborhood: lower the default speed and force repeat speeders to slow down. Albany’s speed‑limiter bill is ready (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>). New Yorkers are already asking the city to lower speeds now.

Council Member Feliz stands opposed. Business groups resist. Eighty-five thousand daily riders face slow, crowded buses. City’s promise for safer, faster transit stalls. DOT offers compromise. Vulnerable commuters wait.</p><p class=mb3>On July 20, 2023, the MTA called on Mayor Eric Adams and the Department of Transportation (DOT) to support renewed bus lane expansion on Fordham Road. The city had canceled a planned busway after pushback from business owners and Council Member Oswald Feliz, who remains a vocal critic. MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey said, "Our hope is that we DOT stays with us and we're implementing this, hopefully, later this year." MTA CEO Janno Lieber stressed, "We can't deemphasize and under-prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx and also Upper Manhattan who are trying to get east and west across this incredibly busy corridor." DOT spokesperson Vin Barone described a new proposal with dedicated curbside loading and minimal traffic diversions. The city’s earlier pledge for 20 new miles of bus lanes per year has not been met. Eighty-five thousand daily bus riders, many vulnerable, remain at risk on slow, crowded streets. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, which would grant New York City local control over its speed limits, remains stalled in the Assembly. The rally, led by Families for Safe Streets, called out lawmakers for refusing to bring the measure to a vote. Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry.
