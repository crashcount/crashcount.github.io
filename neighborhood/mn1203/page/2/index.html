The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

De La Rosa declared, 'These workers are already being discriminated against and marginalized in our city. Let’s not make their lives harder by allowing a loophole in the law to take money out of their pockets.' The bills seek to close the 'Instacart loophole' and ensure equity for all delivery workers. The Council also passed a bill raising the cap on fees delivery apps can charge restaurants, which will result in Relay workers receiving the $21.44 minimum wage.
