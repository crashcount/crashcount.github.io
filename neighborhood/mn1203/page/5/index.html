The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when the vehicle hit him, resulting in a traumatic amputation of his arm. The report states the driver was inattentive and distracted, and also cites 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor. The narrative confirms the driver 'didn’t see him.' The pedestrian remained conscious after the collision. The police report makes no mention of any pedestrian error or unsafe behavior, emphasizing instead the role of driver inattention and speed.

The project, supported by Councilmember Carmen De La Rosa (District 10), was announced by the NYC Department of Transportation. The matter summary states, 'The improvements... aim to enhance safety for pedestrians and cyclists and provide faster bus service.' De La Rosa, who represents the area, said, 'I've never been so afraid to walk a bridge on foot... it was an accident waiting to happen.' The overhaul separates cyclists and pedestrians from cars with jersey barriers and fences, and adds protected pedestrian paths. Automated cameras will enforce the bus lane. The DOT plans further safety measures, including a leading pedestrian interval at crossings.

The driver, a male operating without a valid license, was engaged in aggressive driving and road rage. The report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Aggressive Driving/Road Rage' as contributing factors to the crash. The pedestrian was located outside an intersection and suffered abrasions to her elbow, lower arm, and hand, resulting in shock and injury severity level 3. Vehicle damage was confined to the left side doors.

Introduced March 7, 2024, it urges Albany to pass and sign a law creating unlimited subway and bus transfers within two hours for pay-per-ride users. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation, which would create unlimited transfers within the two-hour period of paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority subway or bus fare for pay-per-ride users.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez leads as primary sponsor, joined by Riley, Stevens, Hanif, Won, Feliz, Salaam, Hanks, Farías, De La Rosa, Cabán, Williams, Hudson, Ung, Ossé, Banks, and Holden. The sponsors argue the current one-transfer rule hits hardest for riders with long, complex trips, often in transit deserts. They demand fare equity for all, not just those with short, easy rides.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
