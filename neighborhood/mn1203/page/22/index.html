That points to lighting, hardened turns, and signal time that favors people crossing — especially on Sherman, 10th, and Broadway. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data</a> makes the case.</p><p>Build the safe space and people live.

State Senator <a href=/senate-district/31/>Robert Jackson</a> co‑sponsors it and voted yes in committee (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bill</a>).

Our neighbors pay the price each day we wait. The path is written down. The numbers are not moving on their own.</p><p>Lower the default speed. Curb the worst repeat offenders. Then go corner by corner on Sherman, 10th, and Broadway and harden the turns, daylight the sight lines, and give walkers the time.</p><p>One boy and one girl were thrown from a bike on Isham.

Advocates demand more.</p><p class=mb3>On June 15, 2022, the Department of Transportation announced a senior pedestrian safety initiative. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "We are a data-driven administration. We are following the crashes. We are focusing on the most dangerous intersections." The plan targets 50 intersections per year with turn-calming treatments like plastic bollards, rubber speed bumps, and paint. It focuses on 'Senior Pedestrian Zones' with high injury rates, but leaves out some neighborhoods with large senior populations. The plan also expands Leading Pedestrian Intervals and promises at least 10 Senior Street Improvement Projects annually. Critics, including Second Avenue Sagas, slammed the slow pace: "Fifty a year sounds like pushing a boulder up a hill with a toothpick." Advocates call the plan a small step, but say it falls short as senior deaths continue. No council bill number or committee is attached; this is a DOT policy action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency will swap out heavy Jersey barriers for curb-height blocks, wave delineators, and armadillo-shaped bumps. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The Better Barriers pilot is an example of the innovative ways we are addressing traffic safety and improving our cycling network.' The pilot launches on Union Square East, with plans to expand. Mayor Adams and Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi both praised the creative push for safer streets. Advocacy groups like StreetsPAC and Open Plans welcomed the move but raised doubts about durability and the risk of partial barriers failing to keep lanes clear. Bike New York warned, 'simply putting barriers or partial barriers along the edges of the lanes isn’t sufficient to keep them clear.' The city promises faster, more cost-effective protection, but the fight for real safety continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Crashes drop when streets close to cars.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2022, the Department of Transportation held a press conference in response to a Streetsblog investigation revealing high rates of traffic violence near city schools, especially in communities of color. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez announced plans to redesign dozens of school streets this year, stating, 'Our children and families deserve to be able to walk to school without the fear of being struck by a speeding or reckless driving.' Rodriguez highlighted collaborations with students and a $1 billion budget for street safety, but did not commit to expanding car-free school streets. Advocates argue that closing streets to cars is the most effective way to protect children, a method rarely used in New York City. The city did not release a list of the 100 planned projects or specify how many are near schools. Streetsblog’s reporting shows that closing streets to cars near schools leads to dramatic drops in crashes and injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes, reauthorizes and expands New York City’s school-zone speed camera program to operate 24/7. The measure was debated in the Senate, with Sen. Robert Jackson and Gounardes defending it: 'Cars speeding in New York kill New Yorkers, injure New Yorkers.' Gounardes called the cameras 'life-saving.' Opponents, including Sen. Andrew Lanza, dismissed the program as a 'cash register.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives said, 'When New York City’s speed safety cameras turn off, speeding increases and crashes rise.' The bill awaits Assembly action before the legislative session ends.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill moved through committee and passed the Senate and Assembly, with key votes on May 20, 2021, February 1, 2022, May 16, 2022, and May 23, 2022. The matter summary reads: 'Requires instruction in pedestrian and bicyclist safety as part of the drivers pre-licensing course.' Primary sponsor: Senator Gounardes, joined by Bailey, Biaggi, Brisport, Cleare, Comrie, and others. The measure targets driver ignorance, a root cause of deadly crashes, by putting vulnerable road users at the center of driver education.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
