The living carry scars.</p><p>Pedestrians are struck crossing with the light, crossing against it, or just standing still. A 34-year-old lost an arm at 207th and 10th. A 24-year-old was cut down by a turning sedan on 203rd. Two men were crushed by speeding cars on Sherman Avenue.

The man died in the fire. His family had to use dental records to know it was him. &ldquo;To think he was in that car suffering for that long. One minute&rsquo;s too long.

They pass laws to lower speed limits. They install cameras. But the work is not finished. The cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The 20 mph limit is still a promise, not a fact. Inwood waits. The dead do not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone, somewhere, to let speed and steel rule the street. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to finish the job: lower the speed, keep the cameras on, and build streets that forgive mistakes. Do not wait for another body to burn. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Change takes effect June 26.</p><p class=mb3>On May 27, 2025, the city adopted a new rule allowing mopeds on the lower roadway of the Queensboro Bridge and on the Brooklyn Bridge, removing them from bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "This rule change expands safe and practical travel options for moped riders—particularly the thousands of delivery workers and commuters who depend on them every day, while also enhancing safety for pedestrians and cyclists by reducing conflicts on shared crossings." The rule takes effect June 26. The move follows years of complaints about mopeds crowding bike lanes and endangering cyclists and pedestrians. Streetsblog NYC reported the change, noting that previous city law forced mopeds into bike lanes, creating hazardous conditions. Removing mopeds from bike lanes reduces conflicts and speeds in spaces intended for vulnerable users, improving safety and comfort for pedestrians and cyclists and supporting mode shift.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.'

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch.

The impact threw him into the path of a red delivery truck, which ran him over. Police said Smaragdis suffered severe head trauma and died at Bellevue Hospital. The article notes, 'The man who died after being doored while riding an e-bike and then run over by a passing truck...was a popular and influential synthwave artist.' The crash highlights the ongoing danger of dooring and the lethal consequences when street design and driver actions fail to protect cyclists. No mention of charges or policy changes followed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law’s loophole leaves workers exposed, underpaid, and afraid. The fight for fair pay continues.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2025, the City Council, led by Council Member Carmen De La Rosa, rallied for two bills: Intro 1133 and Intro 1135. Both aim to expand minimum wage protections to all delivery workers, including those for third-party grocery services like Instacart. The rally, held on May Day, highlighted the vulnerability of immigrant delivery workers, many of whom stayed home due to heightened deportation fears. De La Rosa declared, 'These workers are already being discriminated against and marginalized in our city. Let’s not make their lives harder by allowing a loophole in the law to take money out of their pockets.' The bills seek to close the 'Instacart loophole' and ensure equity for all delivery workers. The Council also passed a bill raising the cap on fees delivery apps can charge restaurants, which will result in Relay workers receiving the $21.44 minimum wage. The current law’s confusion and gaps leave many workers unprotected and at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rally, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw few delivery workers attend. The matter summary reads: 'Advocates for delivery workers rallied on May Day in support of two pro-delivery worker bills, but many workers stayed home due to fears of deportation.' De La Rosa called for closing the Instacart loophole and ending discrimination. The chilling effect of immigration enforcement left the most at-risk workers absent. Safety analysts warn: when vulnerable workers avoid advocacy, their ability to demand safer streets and fair conditions shrinks. Systemic risks and inequities for pedestrians and cyclists persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program opened three delivery hubs at Amsterdam Avenue at 85th Street, Amsterdam at 73rd Street, and Broadway at 77th Street. According to the DOT, these hubs are part of a three-year pilot under the Curb Management Action Plan. The official matter summary states: 'The DOT unveiled three new microhubs to promote cleaner, greener, last-mile deliveries.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, applauded the initiative, saying, 'It is incredibly important to have these hubs where we can pull the trucks off the streets and get the delivery via bicycle.' The pilot aims to cut truck congestion, reduce double parking, and shift deliveries to low-emission modes. Delivery giants like Amazon and UPS will use the hubs.
