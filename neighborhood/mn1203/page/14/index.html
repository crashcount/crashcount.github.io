Five with injuries so severe they will not forget.</strong> In the last three and a half years, Inwood has seen 724 crashes. Four hundred and four people hurt. The dead do not speak. The living carry scars.</p><p>Pedestrians are struck crossing with the light, crossing against it, or just standing still. A 34-year-old lost an arm at 207th and 10th. A 24-year-old was cut down by a turning sedan on 203rd. Two men were crushed by speeding cars on Sherman Avenue. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>SUVs and sedans are the weapons most often used.</strong></p><h3 id=when-help-does-not-come>When Help Does Not Come</h3><p>On Dyckman Street, a car burned. The man inside was alive when the flames started. Police arrived, then left. No help. No call for aid. &ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The man died in the fire. His family had to use dental records to know it was him. &ldquo;To think he was in that car suffering for that long. One minute&rsquo;s too long. Imagine more than 15 minutes,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Shakira Guzman</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>City leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. They pass laws to lower speed limits. They install cameras. But the work is not finished. The cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The 20 mph limit is still a promise, not a fact. Inwood waits. The dead do not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone, somewhere, to let speed and steel rule the street. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to finish the job: lower the speed, keep the cameras on, and build streets that forgive mistakes. Do not wait for another body to burn. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The effort, known as daylighting, aims to improve visibility and pedestrian safety. Adams said, 'Protecting New Yorkers is my most sacred responsibility as mayor.' Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers praised daylighting as 'a proven safety measure.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stressed that daylighting must include physical infrastructure to prevent reckless turns. The Department of Transportation will also add raised crosswalks, extended sidewalks, and leading pedestrian signals at 1,000 intersections next year. The city will expand speed restriction technology in its fleet and increase data transparency. Advocates and community boards have long called for these changes. With nearly 47,000 intersections citywide, the plan will take decades to reach every corner.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, called the lanes 'life-saving' and said they fill a critical gap, connecting cyclists to the Queensboro and Pulaski bridges. The project follows years of advocacy, including a 2019 push by then-Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer. Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives praised the concrete curbs and daylighting but warned that gaps remain—especially at confusing intersections and near truck routes. Shepard urged DOT to add more physical barriers and expand the network, noting, 'It’s exciting, but we still need a lot more.' The new lanes mark progress, but the area’s vulnerable road users still face danger from incomplete connections and blocked paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He stated, 'The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.'

The resolution urges the city to daylight 'all possible' intersections with physical barriers, quoting: 'We don’t want to wait for tragedy, we know what works and we want to get it done.' Board co-chair Doug Gordon and member Marc Torrence led the push, highlighting the danger of blocked sightlines. The board also backed a new city law requiring daylighting at 100 intersections per year starting in 2025. The measure passed 33-3. The board’s action follows deadly crashes and echoes similar calls from Queens and Manhattan boards. Daylighting is proven to reduce crashes and protect pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called DOT’s lack of progress tracking on the Streets Plan 'unacceptable.' The city has built only 13.5 of the required 50 miles of protected bike lanes this year. Advocates accuse Mayor Adams of abandoning cyclists and failing to meet legal safety obligations.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) published the rule, citing 'overcrowding on the Brooklyn Bridge' and concerns about 'impediments to safety and pedestrian mobility.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'These proposed rules would make it safer and easier for pedestrians to enjoy the Brooklyn Bridge.' Police have already begun enforcement, removing vendors at Mayor Adams’s direction. Mohamed Attia of the Street Vendor Project called the move 'disappointing,' arguing that helping vendors comply with siting rules would be safer. A virtual hearing is set for November 15.

Vulnerable road users wait as city agencies stall and argue.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2023, the City Council Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, held an oversight hearing on the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) compliance with the Streets Master Plan under Local Law 195. Brooks-Powers demanded specifics: 'DOT has struggled to meet its legal mandate. In 2021, DOT installed just 4.4 miles of bus lane—well below 20-mile requirement.' DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton and Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, refused to provide current figures, promising data next year. Brooks-Powers called this 'unacceptable.' She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency. Staffing shortages and council opposition to projects were cited as obstacles. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing, led by the Committee on Transportation, featured testimony from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and others criticized the agency for 'continuously falling behind on legally required bus and bike lanes.' The matter title reads: 'NYC Council members slam Transportation Department on bus, bike lane backlog.' Restler’s action was to publicly challenge DOT’s delays. No safety analyst note was provided, but the council’s frustration highlights the risk: every missed lane leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pedestrians and cyclists bore the brunt. The Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan saw the worst rates. City law forced new data into the open. The carnage continues. Bold action is demanded.</p><p class=mb3>A new report released September 11, 2023, shows a sharp rise in serious traffic injuries in New York City. The data, analyzed by Transportation Alternatives, covers 4,224 severe injuries from January 2022 to June 2023. In the second quarter of 2023 alone, 784 people—192 pedestrians and 124 cyclists among them—were seriously hurt, up from 718 the year before. The law requiring this data was sponsored by then-Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez. The report’s title calls this a 'preventable public health crisis.' Philip Miatkowski of Transportation Alternatives blames decades of policy that 'prioritize cars over people and leave behind our most vulnerable.' The data shows the Bronx had 23 percent more serious injuries per capita than the city average, Brooklyn 27 percent more, and Manhattan’s cyclist injuries were 77 percent higher per capita. The city’s DOT claims safety redesigns are underway, but the toll on vulnerable road users keeps climbing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
