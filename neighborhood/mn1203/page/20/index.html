Five with injuries so severe they will not forget.</strong> In the last three and a half years, Inwood has seen 724 crashes. Four hundred and four people hurt. The dead do not speak. The living carry scars.</p><p>Pedestrians are struck crossing with the light, crossing against it, or just standing still. A 34-year-old lost an arm at 207th and 10th. A 24-year-old was cut down by a turning sedan on 203rd. Two men were crushed by speeding cars on Sherman Avenue. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>SUVs and sedans are the weapons most often used.</strong></p><h3 id=when-help-does-not-come>When Help Does Not Come</h3><p>On Dyckman Street, a car burned. The man inside was alive when the flames started. Police arrived, then left. No help. No call for aid. &ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The man died in the fire. His family had to use dental records to know it was him. &ldquo;To think he was in that car suffering for that long. One minute&rsquo;s too long. Imagine more than 15 minutes,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Shakira Guzman</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>City leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. They pass laws to lower speed limits. They install cameras. But the work is not finished. The cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The 20 mph limit is still a promise, not a fact. Inwood waits. The dead do not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone, somewhere, to let speed and steel rule the street. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to finish the job: lower the speed, keep the cameras on, and build streets that forgive mistakes. Do not wait for another body to burn. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets get a fighting chance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2022, the City announced an $11 million budget allocation for street cleaning and bike lane maintenance. The measure, led by Councilwoman Sandy Nurse of District 37, restores alternate side parking and funds year-round cleaning of protected bike lanes. The official summary states: 'City allocates $11 million to make streets cleaner and improve mobility.' Nurse called the move 'a welcome relief to communities that have faced an unprecedented increase in litter during the pandemic.' The investment covers new equipment and staff, including a pilot fleet of 10 Micromobility Operations Machines to sweep narrow lanes. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine praised the smaller sweepers as 'a win for cyclists.' The funding appears in the Fiscal Year 2023 executive budget. The city aims to keep bike lanes clear, cut debris, and protect vulnerable road users from car intrusion.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The press conference, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted the city's lack of ambition. Rodriguez said, 'We encourage all New Yorkers to embrace the streets and imagine what could be possible if we open our streets for more than just moving personal vehicles.' Yet, no new initiatives were announced. The event's limited scope drew sharp criticism. The article compared New York's effort to the Netherlands' 1970s 'car-free Sundays,' which led to real change. Here, the city offers a press release, not protection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, children—see little relief. The cars keep coming.

The article states: 'Many of the cars parked illegally by officers have multiple red light and speed camera violations, with the 69th Precinct having a particularly high percentage of repeat offenders.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the City Council that multiple camera violations should be rare, but precinct records show otherwise. The investigation criticizes NYPD’s disregard for pedestrian space and traffic laws, documenting officers’ contempt for street safety and the law.

Rodriguez said, "We have found a way to make a secure parking pilot work for New York City." Bike New York's Jon Orcutt voiced frustration: "Enough with the pilots. We love Oonee, but if it doesn't scale, it doesn't matter." The DOT will collect usage data to inform future steps. Assistant Commissioner Sean Quinn noted the limited number of pods and the need for broader access.

Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On March 8, 2022, Councilmember Crystal Hudson hosted a heated debate on the Willoughby Avenue open street in District 35. The meeting followed the abrupt, unannounced removal of barriers from the eight-block stretch, which sparked swift backlash. Hudson, joined by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez, faced vocal opponents worried about lost parking and emergency access. Hudson said, 'This is about more than just open streets, this is about safe streets.' DOT surveys showed 88 percent support for permanent safety changes. Mayor Eric Adams ordered the street restored after learning Hudson opposed its closure. Rodríguez highlighted a spike in traffic deaths, noting, 'We have a responsibility to think about, first of all, protecting our senior citizens.' According to NYC Crash Mapper, 72 people—mostly cyclists and motorists—were injured on this stretch in the past decade, but no deaths. The open streets program, launched during the pandemic, remains popular and aims to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Massengale writes, 'We need a better New York City, with fewer cars, less death, and healthier streets.' He criticizes DOT’s focus on moving cars and incremental safety fixes, calling them 'band aids.' Massengale urges Rodriguez to return to Vision Zero’s promise and adopt bold, systemic changes.

The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected.

TransitCenter’s Tabitha Decker noted that most recommended reforms remain unimplemented. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Mayor Adams claim bold plans, but advocates see little concrete action.

Advocates demanded fair use of public space. Council Member Julie Menin raised noise and garbage concerns. The hearing exposed the fight over who controls the curb—and who pays.</p><p class=mb3>On February 9, 2022, the City Council held a hearing on making the Open Restaurants program permanent and charging fees for curbside dining. The matter, titled 'Hearing Day: Could Fees for Outdoor Dining Lead to Proper Pricing of City’s Curbs?', was discussed in committee. Council Member Julie Menin, representing District 5, participated and voiced concerns about noise, garbage, and parking loss. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez explained that fees would depend on location and space size. Advocates like Sara Lind and Marco Conner DiAquoi argued for equity, noting, 'Seventy-five percent of our public curb space is devoted to the movement and storage of vehicles.' The hearing highlighted calls for better public space management and a dedicated oversight office. Community boards remained divided, citing nightlife and local control issues. The debate centered on reclaiming curb space from cars and making the city safer and fairer for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
