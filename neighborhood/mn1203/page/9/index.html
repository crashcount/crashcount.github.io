They pass laws to lower speed limits. They install cameras. But the work is not finished. The cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The 20 mph limit is still a promise, not a fact. Inwood waits. The dead do not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone, somewhere, to let speed and steel rule the street. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to finish the job: lower the speed, keep the cameras on, and build streets that forgive mistakes.

Levine wrote, 'The Hudson River Greenway is one of the most heavily used bike paths in the country... congestion has worsened significantly.' He sent his letter to state DOT Commissioner Therese Dominguez and city DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Local elected officials and Community Board 1, which voted 41-3 in May 2020 to support the change, also back the plan. State senators, assembly members, and council members signed a letter urging the same. Levine and supporters argue the new lane would ease crowding and give e-bike delivery workers—many of them immigrants—a safe, legal route. The state DOT has resisted, citing car congestion. Advocates say more space for cyclists is overdue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Carmen N. De La Rosa led as primary sponsor, joined by Salamanca, Louis, Brewer, Joseph, Yeger, Dinowitz, and Sanchez.

De La Rosa criticized the Parks Department's 'lack of communication' and pushed for a safer alternative. Community Board 12 and former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz backed a temporary protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway, calling it 'far superior and much safer.' The Parks Department is now gathering stakeholders, including city and state transportation officials, to find a solution.

The agency had intended to reroute cyclists and pedestrians onto Broadway, a congested, hazardous road. Council Member Carmen De La Rosa of District 10 intervened, calling the Broadway detour 'pretty crazy' due to heavy traffic and parkway exits. De La Rosa pushed for alternatives, including a temporary protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway, which had support from Community Board 12. The matter, titled 'Parks Dept. Halts Greenway Repair to Mull Creating Safe Detour for Cyclists,' highlights the city’s repeated failure to provide safe detours during greenway closures. Cyclist Allegra Legrande praised De La Rosa’s advocacy and demanded real-time updates and safe routes for vulnerable road users. The project remains on hold as safer options are considered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines.

Stevens led as primary sponsor, joined by 26 co-sponsors including Hudson, Williams, Restler, Krishnan, and others.
