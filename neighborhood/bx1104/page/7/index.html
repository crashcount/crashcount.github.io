Three serious injuries. Ninety-five people hurt in the last year.</strong> These are not just numbers—they are lives in Allerton, torn by crashes that never make the news. The pain is quiet, but it does not stop. A 13-year-old girl, neck crushed, crossing with the light at Williamsbridge and Allerton. A 45-year-old woman, head bleeding, struck by a moped on White Plains Road. A 48-year-old woman, leg shattered, hit by a truck while crossing with the signal on Wallace Avenue. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The data is public, but the grief is private.</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-relentless>The Pattern Is Relentless</h3><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, people just trying to cross the street. In the last twelve months, not a single fatality, but three people left with injuries that will not heal. The last year saw a drop in deaths, but the crashes keep coming. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>A moped, a truck, an SUV—each one a weapon in the wrong hands.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> Speed cameras, lower limits, new laws. But in Allerton, the pace is slow. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras that save lives are at risk of going dark. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired. The silence is loud. Each delay is another risk, another family waiting for the call that changes everything.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a failure of will. The city can act. The council can act. You can act. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand cameras that never go dark.

Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsored the bill, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate, and others. The report was due by December 31, 2023. The bill was filed at the end of session with no report issued. The measure aimed to examine street redesign, traffic calming, and camera enforcement to keep trucks out of residential areas, but it stalled before any impact reached the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
