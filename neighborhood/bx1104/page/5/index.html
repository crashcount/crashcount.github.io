The driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, and, according to a complaint, had a strong odor of alcohol and stood unsteadily at the scene. The highway shut near Gun Hill.

People on foot, on bikes, on small motors. The bodies are local.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks-you>Where the street breaks you</h3><p>The worst injuries cluster on Bronxwood Avenue, Burke Avenue, Adee Avenue, and Allerton Avenue. Each shows serious harm. Each has people hit and sent to the hospital. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On White Plains Road at 2823, a moped struck two pedestrians. A 45‑year‑old woman had severe bleeding and was semiconscious. A 46‑year‑old man took a blow to the face. “Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way,” the record says. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>At Williamsbridge and Allerton, a 13‑year‑old girl crossing with the signal suffered crush injuries. The form lists her as semiconscious. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The hours tell on us. Injuries spike through the afternoon and early evening, then again at 9, 10, and 11 a.m., with a grim pulse at 4 to 6 p.m. One death struck at 9 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=what-keeps-showing-up>What keeps showing up</h3><p>“Other” driver behavior leads the harm here, with inattention and failure to yield close behind. Pedestrians and cyclists take the blows: 54 injured on foot, 30 on bikes in this small area since 2022. Heavy vehicles add to the damage, with trucks involved in multiple serious pedestrian cases. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The count does not stay still. Year to date, crashes in Allerton are up about 29% from last year’s pace, even as deaths tick to zero. Injuries rose too. One number falls. Another rises. The street remains the same. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=parkway-blood-neighborhood-fear>Parkway blood, neighborhood fear</h3><p>Police say the parkway case began with a pass attempt and ended with two young men dead. Officials named the riders, ages 19 and 21. The driver refused a chemical test, according to prosecutors. Southbound lanes closed near Exit 9. Morning traffic waited behind flares. A family asked, “How could they let him go?” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> | <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a> | <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/2-killed-1-taken-into-custody-in-multivehicle-bronx-river-parkway-crash-nypd-says>Gothamist</a></p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-slow-the-steel>Fix the corners, slow the steel</h3><p>What would help here is simple and near: daylighting at Bronxwood, Burke, Adee, and Allerton. Hardened turns and leading pedestrian intervals to stop the quick cut. Raised crossings where people actually cross. Truck routing and targeted enforcement on the worst blocks. These are standard tools. They save lives when used. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The city has bigger tools too. Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone cameras. And there is a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that won’t let them push past the limit. Senators including Gustavo Rivera voted yes in committee. The measure targets people with patterns: high DMV points or repeated camera tickets. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/11/streetspac-ranks-lander-1-for-mayor-offers-other-picks-for-comptroller-beeps-and-council>Streetsblog NYC</a> | <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a></p><p>City leaders also hold the power to drop default speeds on local streets. Slower traffic leaves more survivors. Fewer families waiting in ER hallways. The mandate is clear. Use it. <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Queens Councilman Robert F. Holden, representing District 30, condemned the move, stating, 'It’s no surprise that businesses will pass the Congestion Scam Tax on to consumers.' Companies like CompuVoip and Dream Events & Decor now add surcharges for customers in the zone. Holden’s criticism joins that of Bronx Councilwoman Kristy Marmorato and others, who warn of higher costs and increased gridlock. Emergency unions claim response times will suffer.

Cars pay to cross south of 60th. Lawmakers split. Some call it a burden. Others hail cleaner air, safer streets, and better transit. The toll stirs anger, hope, and a fight over who pays and who breathes.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2025, congestion pricing (no bill number cited) will begin in Manhattan after a federal judge allowed the toll to proceed. The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, set to fund $15 billion in subway and rail improvements, drew fierce opposition from unions and Councilwoman Kristy Marmorato, who called it a 'cash grab' that would 'increase all costs in our daily lives.' The union for FDNY EMTs argued the toll would burden low-wage workers, but data shows 90% of commuters already use public transit. City officials, including mayoral spokesperson Liz Garcia, insisted emergency response would not suffer. The measure's summary notes that reducing car traffic will speed up emergency vehicles and protect passengers. The uproar highlights the tension between entrenched driving privileges and the urgent need to make streets safer for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Richards opposes lifting mandates in Queens, citing poor transit. Marmorato lobbied to restore mandates in a Bronx rezoning near new Metro North stations, arguing, 'We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities.' The editorial rebukes this logic, stating, 'We should not cling to parking mandates when we know they encourage car ownership, make streets less vibrant, increase rents, and pollute our air.' The piece urges officials to break the cycle of car-first policy, invest in transit, and end mandates that block affordable housing and safer streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the editorial centers the harm parking mandates inflict on vulnerable road users and the city’s livability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move blocks plans to cut car use and build more affordable housing. Cars stay king. Transit and vulnerable road users lose ground.</p><p class=mb3>On August 7, 2024, the City Council's Land Use Committee, led by Kristy Marmorato, amended a rezoning plan (no bill number provided) for areas near two new Metro-North stations. The committee rejected the Adams administration's push to eliminate parking requirements, instead voting to retain mandates and lower building heights. Marmorato argued, "We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities," and prioritized drivers over reducing car dependency. The proposal, part of the Mayor's 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' plan, aimed to boost affordable housing and transit-oriented development. Marmorato's stance, echoed in multiple statements, keeps parking at the center and limits safer, walkable streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the move preserves car dominance and its dangers for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
