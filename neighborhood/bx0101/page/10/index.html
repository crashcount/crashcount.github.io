The report states the e-scooter operator 'hit a parked sedan,' was 'ejected,' and landed 'face first.' The man suffered 'severe lacerations' to his face but remained conscious at the scene. The police report explicitly lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. The sedan, a 2017 Nissan, was parked and sustained no damage. The e-scooter rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this detail is mentioned only after the primary cause: inattention. The collision left the street marked by blood and injury, underscoring the lethal consequences of distraction on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
