Pedestrians. Riders. Most hurt are car occupants, but the unprotected pay the price. The city’s own data says so (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=nights-are-the-danger-hours>Nights are the danger hours</h3><p>Between midnight and 3 a.m., injuries stack up.

The pattern is steady and cruel (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>SUVs and sedans hit most pedestrians here. Trucks and buses add weight to the harm.

The Bruckner Expressway shows 65 injured. 3rd Avenue has 53 injuries. East 135th Street has 51. East 141st has 22. These are repeat scenes. Same streets. Same outcomes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Link the names to the places.

No comfort (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). A 22-year-old passenger died where Bruckner meets Southern. A tanker truck turned left. A moped went straight. The passenger did not walk away (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). A 17-year-old pedestrian died on East 138th Street. The truck kept going straight.

Police said a 21-year-old tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then two motorcycles. “Police have arrested and charged a man with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated,” reported one outlet. A sister said, “Two people were killed. He was drunk” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><h3 id=the-street-fixes-this-neighborhood-cant-wait-for>The street fixes this neighborhood can’t wait for</h3><ul><li>Daylight every corner on Bruckner Boulevard and 3rd Avenue.

The city can drop residential speeds. The call for a default 20 mph is on the table. The ask is simple: slow the cars, save the people (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>In Albany, lawmakers pushed bills to fit repeat violators with speed limiters. State Sen. José Serrano voted yes in committee to move S4045 forward. Assembly Member Amanda Septimo co-sponsored the matching A2299. The bills require intelligent speed assistance for drivers who rack up points or a stack of camera tickets (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States: S4045</a>; <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States: A2299</a>).</p><p>“Speed kills,” our own campaign says. The families know this. So do the numbers. The question is whether the city will use the power it already has (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Take one step today. Tell City Hall and your council member to lower the default speed and back the speed‑limiter bills. One call can move a vote. One vote can spare a life (<a href=/take_action/>Act now</a>).</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article states, "NYPD sources said the two officers in pursuit returned to their stationhouse without reporting the crash." The FDNY later found Guzman Parra dead in the burning car. Patrick Hendry of the Police Benevolent Association claimed officers "lost sight of the car and did not know it crashed," but the family's attorney, Jeremy Feigenbaum, said their investigation "has not corroborated the officers' claim." The officers remain on leave as both the NYPD and the New York attorney general's office investigate.
