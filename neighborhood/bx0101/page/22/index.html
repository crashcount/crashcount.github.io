The push comes ahead of the next budget cycle. Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Amanda Septimo, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher led the call. Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit.
