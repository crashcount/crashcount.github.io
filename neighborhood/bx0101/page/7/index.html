Six people walking were hit. The car smashed into scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran. The Mustang sat there, front end ruined, plates gone. The street was left with blood and broken glass. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Vivian Cole</a>. Another witness thought it was a bomb. &ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>.</p><p>Six people went to the hospital.

It is daily life here.</p><h3 id=the-toll-deaths-and-injuries-stack-up>The Toll: Deaths and Injuries Stack Up</h3><p>In the last year, three people have died on these streets. Over 400 have been hurt. Eleven were left with serious injuries. Most were walking, biking, or just trying to cross. Cars and trucks did the most harm, but motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all played a part. The numbers do not slow. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has backed bills to light step streets, ban parking near crosswalks, and legalize jaywalking. She voted to end penalties for crossing outside the lines, a move meant to stop blaming the dead and the hurt. But the city still waits for real change. The streets are not safe. The laws are not enough. The drivers keep running.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>This is not fate. These deaths are not the weather. Call Ayala. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand action, not speeches. Six people hit in one morning is six too many. Tomorrow, it could be you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
