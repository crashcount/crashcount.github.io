A cyclist, 37, crushed by a truck. A man, 46, dead on a parkway. In the last three years, five people have died in traffic crashes in Washington Heights (North). Fourteen more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Nearly 600 people have been hurt since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-maim>The Machines That Maim</h3><p>SUVs and sedans hit hardest. They account for the most injuries and serious wounds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds leave bodies broken. Even bikes draw blood. The street does not care who you are. It only cares who is bigger, faster, heavier.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in these blocks, the pain keeps coming. One death, then another. Laws pass in Albany, but the wait drags on for real change. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. Cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany stalls. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a name lost.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made by someone, or a choice not made by leaders. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not bleed.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Levine wrote, 'The Hudson River Greenway is one of the most heavily used bike paths in the country... congestion has worsened significantly.' He sent his letter to state DOT Commissioner Therese Dominguez and city DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Local elected officials and Community Board 1, which voted 41-3 in May 2020 to support the change, also back the plan. State senators, assembly members, and council members signed a letter urging the same. Levine and supporters argue the new lane would ease crowding and give e-bike delivery workers—many of them immigrants—a safe, legal route. The state DOT has resisted, citing car congestion. Advocates say more space for cyclists is overdue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

De La Rosa criticized the Parks Department's 'lack of communication' and pushed for a safer alternative. Community Board 12 and former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz backed a temporary protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway, calling it 'far superior and much safer.'

The agency had intended to reroute cyclists and pedestrians onto Broadway, a congested, hazardous road. Council Member Carmen De La Rosa of District 10 intervened, calling the Broadway detour 'pretty crazy' due to heavy traffic and parkway exits. De La Rosa pushed for alternatives, including a temporary protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway, which had support from Community Board 12. The matter, titled 'Parks Dept. Halts Greenway Repair to Mull Creating Safe Detour for Cyclists,' highlights the city’s repeated failure to provide safe detours during greenway closures. Cyclist Allegra Legrande praised De La Rosa’s advocacy and demanded real-time updates and safe routes for vulnerable road users.

The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.
