Eight were left with serious injuries. Not one week passes without sirens. Not one month without blood on the pavement.</p><p>Just days ago, a 29-year-old cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit her, and ran. The officers checked the scene, then left. The car was abandoned. The woman was hospitalized. The driver vanished. A neighbor watched and <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the past year, 371 crashes tore through this part of Manhattan. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none spared. The numbers are steady. The pain is constant.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-slow-progress>Broken Promises, Slow Progress</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They vote for speed cameras and praise redesigns. The city claims a 32% drop in deaths citywide, but the wounds keep coming. Council Member Carmen De La Rosa, Assembly Member Manny De Los Santos, and State Senator Robert Jackson all <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>backed the renewal of school speed cameras</a>. The DOT claims a 32% drop in deaths citywide, but here, the danger remains.</p><p>Residents know the truth. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying,&rdquo;</a> said Nina Schmidt. The intersection at 181st and Cabrini is a trap. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a policy failure. Every injury is a choice made by those in power. The law now allows the city to set safer speeds. The cameras are watching, but the cars keep coming.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just promises.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now. The street will not forgive delay.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez praised cycling’s power to connect working-class communities and boost life expectancy, saying, "It's about increasing life expectancy, and it's about connecting the working class community." Bike New York CEO Ken Podziba called the program "a transformational power of cycling" to help immigrants acclimate and thrive. The effort responds to the isolation and transportation barriers faced by asylum seekers. Bike donations are accepted at locations in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn.

The article celebrates a 7% drop in traffic fatalities and fewer pedestrian deaths, crediting street redesigns. Projects include 24-7-365 speed cameras, Paseo Park’s permanent open street, Schermerhorn Street’s two-way protected bike lane, Fifth Avenue’s car-free Sundays, Apolline’s Garden intersection redesign, and Emmons Avenue’s new bike lane. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pushed for speed cameras everywhere crashes happen, stating, 'we should have speed cameras everywhere there are crashes.' Despite some local resistance, the city removed parking and created public space, especially after fatal crashes. These changes, backed by council support and public demand, show clear safety gains for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation cut Jamaica Avenue’s busway hours from 24/7 to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, while Archer Avenue remains round-the-clock. The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'NYC DOT proposal for car-free Grand Army Plaza and related street safety improvements,' is not a formal council bill but has drawn council attention. Council Member Shahana Hanif (District 39) and Crystal Hudson pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to address the plaza’s 'endless traffic, poor sidewalk conditions, broken benches, and overflowing trash cans.' Hanif and Hudson demanded immediate safety upgrades after recent crashes injured pedestrians and cyclists. DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton said, 'We want to take it to the next level... more consistent and better designed public spaces.' The agency is seeking public feedback and plans to draft detailed designs within the year. The proposal aims to end the status quo of danger and disrepair, prioritizing vulnerable road users over cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation declined to release full details, making verification impossible. Adams said, "Promise made, promise kept." Rodriguez stressed the need for a culture shift and pointed to 24/7 speed cameras. But activists warn the city lags on protected bike and bus lane goals. Traffic deaths remain high.

The effort, led by the Department of Transportation, included protected bike lanes, road diets, and pedestrian-first signals. Council Member Erik Bottcher, District 3, praised the Eighth Avenue redesign, saying, 'We’ve got room for pedestrians, cyclists, and cars. It’s a much more pleasant corridor.' The announcement followed a year with 187 deaths and over 37,000 injuries by September 30. Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez called for a shift away from car dominance, pushing for a safer, more inclusive city. Despite progress, the toll on vulnerable road users remains high.
