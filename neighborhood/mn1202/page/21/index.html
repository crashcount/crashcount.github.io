A cyclist, 37, crushed by a truck. A man, 46, dead on a parkway. In the last three years, five people have died in traffic crashes in Washington Heights (North). Fourteen more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Nearly 600 people have been hurt since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-maim>The Machines That Maim</h3><p>SUVs and sedans hit hardest. They account for the most injuries and serious wounds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds leave bodies broken. Even bikes draw blood. The street does not care who you are. It only cares who is bigger, faster, heavier.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in these blocks, the pain keeps coming. One death, then another. Laws pass in Albany, but the wait drags on for real change. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. Cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany stalls. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a name lost.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made by someone, or a choice not made by leaders. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not bleed.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, which narrows the boulevard from four lanes to two, faces opposition from local elected officials, including Council Member Joe Borelli, who called it a 'recurring bad idea.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, citing Hylan's high crash rate and the epidemic of speeding, declared, 'I'm proud to announce that this safety project will move forward in the next couple of weeks.' The DOT maintains that reducing lanes and adding left-turn bays calms traffic and cuts crashes, with injury reductions seen on other city streets. Despite political pushback, the agency presses on, aiming to stem the tide of deadly crashes on Staten Island's most dangerous corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) delayed the conversion of the South Outer Roadway to a full-time pedestrian path until at least the end of 2023, citing ongoing bridge repairs. The shared path, only 11 feet wide, is far below DOT’s own safety standards. Injuries have increased as usage soars—nine cyclists hurt in three years, up from three. Julie Won said, "People walking or biking on the shared path are paying with bloody pavement and broken bones, all so the DOT can promote car travel for the few." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the project is a priority, but the city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed. Nine lanes for cars, half a lane each for people.

The city responded only after media inquiry, with DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone stating the proposal is under review as part of the 'Broadway Vision' plan and inviting groups to apply to the Open Streets program. Piccolo dismissed this as 'bureaucratic nonsense.' The Mayor's Office declined comment. The proposal follows renewed calls for pedestrian safety after a serious crash on Broadway.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced strong support, stating, 'This administration welcomes this bill, which is in line with both our vision for a greener, more connected city.' Rivera criticized the current system: 'Many of New York's 100 miles of greenways exist only on paper with no cohesive city network.' The bill would require city agencies to present a plan by July 1 next year. It also shifts responsibility from City Planning to agencies that actually build and maintain greenways. Advocates say this could finally connect fragmented paths and bring safer routes to neighborhoods long left out.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
