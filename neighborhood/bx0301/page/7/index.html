Seven were left with injuries so severe they may never heal. The numbers do not tell you about the silence after the sirens fade. They do not show the blood on the curb, or the empty seat at the table.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a 44-year-old woman was killed on West 174th Street.</strong> The driver did not stop. Police searched the alleyway where she was struck. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. No arrests have been made. The car kept going. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/woman-fatally-struck-hit-run-crash-morris-heights-bronx/17460347/>A 44-year-old woman was fatally struck in a hit-and-run crash in the Bronx.</a></p><p>A neighbor saw it happen. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>&ldquo;I looked over, and he just rolled over that woman and killed her.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last 12 months, Morrisania saw 168 injuries and one death. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are all at risk. SUVs and sedans do most of the damage, but trucks, mopeds, and bikes are not blameless. The violence is steady. The grief is constant.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Luis Sepúlveda <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. He also <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>co-sponsored a bill to expand camera enforcement</a> and voted to extend school speed zones. Assembly Member Chantel Jackson voted to extend school speed zones. Council Member Rafael Salamanca has <a href="https://www.amny.com/?p=137622283">supported crackdowns on fake plates</a> and <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-last-mile-delivery-warehouses-face-a-potential-reckoning-with-regulation>called for more warehouse regulation</a>, but has also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/19/cycle-of-rage-council-members-slam-dot-for-successful-safety-projects>criticized some street redesigns that make streets safer for people on foot and bike</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. <strong>Every week without action is another week of blood on the street.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-doand-must-do>What You Can Do—And Must Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These deaths are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by all who look away. Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Join with others. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The street remembers. The families remember. The city must not forget.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They claimed community harm, ignoring hard data. Bike lanes and safer streets faced political fire. DOT stood firm, citing lives saved and broad support. Vulnerable road users caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on DOT street safety projects and Streets Plan implementation. The hearing, led by Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), Christopher Banks (D-Brooklyn), and Rafael Salamanca Jr. (D-Bronx), focused on the DOT's progress under the Streets Plan, which mandates annual targets for protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns. DOT officials defended their process, emphasizing community engagement and prioritizing high-need areas. The council's opposition stands in stark contrast to the projects' proven safety benefits for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hanif, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Sandy Nurse, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Lincoln Restler, Rafael Salamanca, Jr., and Farah N. Louis.
