Three seriously hurt.</strong> In Tottenville-Charleston, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, the streets have claimed five lives and left three others with wounds that do not heal. One was a child. One was old enough to remember the war. The rest were somewhere in between. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists do not walk away.</strong> In the last twelve months, a sedan struck and killed an 84-year-old man crossing Amboy Road. A 19-year-old woman was hit in the face by a sedan while crossing with the signal on Page Avenue. A 32-year-old cyclist was thrown from his bike by a turning truck on Arthur Kill Road. The details are spare. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-change>Patterns That Do Not Change</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the killing.</strong> Of the deaths and serious injuries, sedans and SUVs are the main weapons. Trucks turn and people fall. Bikes do not kill here. Motorcycles do not kill here. The danger comes on four wheels, with a license plate.</p><p><strong>The young and the old pay most.</strong> In three years, three children have died. Two elders have died. The rest are left to count the cost. The numbers do not move much, year to year. The faces change. The grief does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The laws are slow. The deaths are fast.</strong> City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They point to new speed limits and more cameras. But in Tottenville-Charleston, the pace is glacial. The streets remain wide. The crossings remain long. The cameras blink on and off with Albany’s mood. The council and the mayor have the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The dead are not statistics. They are neighbors. The city can act. The council can vote. The mayor can sign. The DOT can build. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
