Since 2022, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>901 crashes</a> have torn through these streets. <strong>460 people injured.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded limp home, if they can.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, workers. In the last twelve months alone, 157 injuries. Two deaths last year. This year, none yet. But the blood dries fast on the sidewalk. The next call is always coming.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs hit hardest. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans were behind the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks and buses, less frequent, but no less final. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—each leaves its own mark, but the steel always wins.</p><p><strong>The old and the young are not safe.</strong> An 83-year-old woman, dead after a driver backed an SUV into her. A 52-year-old woman, killed crossing at Bay Ridge Avenue. Names fade. The pain does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city claims progress.</strong> Vision Zero. New speed limits. More cameras. But in Dyker Heights, the carnage continues. The council votes, the mayor speaks, the DOT draws new lines. Still, the ambulances come. <strong>Promises do not stop cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders must do more.</strong> Lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Harden every crosswalk. Expand camera enforcement. End the delays. Every day without action is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy, by silence, by delay. <strong>Call your council member.

The matter, titled 'The City Needs a Systemic Fix, Justice for Workers and Accountability by Tech Giants,' exposes how delivery workers, squeezed by low pay and unsafe roads, turn to illegal mopeds. Council Member Alexa Aviles demanded rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and resources for workers. State Sen. Jessica Ramos blamed app companies for shifting costs onto underpaid deliveristas. Advocacy leaders like Carl Mahaney rejected crackdowns, calling for dedicated space instead. Jon Orcutt criticized City Hall’s blindspot on traffic rules. The debate centered on expanding bike lanes, building charging infrastructure, holding tech companies accountable, and buyback programs for unsafe batteries.

No changes yet.</p><p class=mb3>On August 18, 2023, a speeding driver in a Mercedes ran a red light at Atlantic Avenue and Court Street, killing an 18-year-old woman and injuring three others. This stretch of Atlantic Avenue is notorious for deadly crashes. Council Member Lincoln Restler responded, stating, “Our community is unified in demanding immediate changes to dramatically slow down traffic, improve safety at intersections, and install new mid block crossings.” The incident marks the second fatal crash on this corridor in 2023. Despite calls from Restler and other local officials for mid-block crossings and traffic calming after previous deaths, the city has not acted. The bill or action is a public statement, not legislation, but it highlights urgent demands for redesign and enforcement to protect vulnerable road users. No safety improvements have been implemented yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure would force these drivers to install devices that cap speed at five miles per hour above the limit. Gounardes said, 'There is a persistent cohort of drivers... driving on our streets recklessly without any consequences.' The bill was unveiled at the site of a fatal pedestrian crash in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which mandates safety courses for repeat offenders, has faced criticism for weak enforcement.

Politicians and experts slam the move. They say it copies old mistakes, ignores safety, and brings pollution closer to homes. Bike lanes appear, but real safety gains remain unclear.</p><p class=mb3>On July 7, 2023, the Department of Transportation unveiled redesign concepts for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway’s Atlantic Avenue interchange. The plans, discussed in committee, propose new highway off-ramps on Hicks Street. The matter summary states: 'DOT proposals rely on outdated approaches by building new highway ramps instead of eliminating them.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon criticized the plan for increasing traffic and pollution near homes, urging a new approach: 'They need to go back to the drawing board.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called out the reliance on old infrastructure, saying, 'The proposals should not be doubling down on the infrastructure and transportation of the past.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said, 'They don't improve safety, they don't improve traffic, and they certainly don't improve any of the surrounding communities.' All concepts include a buffered or protected bike lane on Atlantic Avenue, but the impact on vulnerable road users remains uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
