Since 2022, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>901 crashes</a> have torn through these streets. <strong>460 people injured.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded limp home, if they can.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, workers. In the last twelve months alone, 157 injuries. Two deaths last year. This year, none yet. But the blood dries fast on the sidewalk. The next call is always coming.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs hit hardest. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans were behind the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks and buses, less frequent, but no less final. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—each leaves its own mark, but the steel always wins.</p><p><strong>The old and the young are not safe.</strong> An 83-year-old woman, dead after a driver backed an SUV into her. A 52-year-old woman, killed crossing at Bay Ridge Avenue. Names fade. The pain does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city claims progress.</strong> Vision Zero. New speed limits. More cameras. But in Dyker Heights, the carnage continues. The council votes, the mayor speaks, the DOT draws new lines. Still, the ambulances come. <strong>Promises do not stop cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders must do more.</strong> Lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Harden every crosswalk. Expand camera enforcement. End the delays. Every day without action is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy, by silence, by delay. <strong>Call your council member.

Ossé, Nantasha M. Williams, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Carlina Rivera, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams as co-sponsors. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law in relation to the establishment of a task force to study options for making street design and infrastructure safer in consideration of increased use of electric bicycles and related collisions.' The committee laid the bill over on December 11, 2024. The task force, if created, must deliver recommendations for legislation and policy within 270 days. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, e-bike riders—remain at risk while the city studies its next move.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bills aim to close a loophole that lets grocery delivery apps like Instacart avoid paying the $20 per hour minimum wage required for restaurant deliveristas. The matter title: 'Council Seeks To Expand Minimum Wage to Grocery Deliveristas.' The hearing is scheduled for December 9. Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the Immigration Committee, called for broader protections: 'When you become a worker, you should be ensured a living wage.' Ligia Guallpa of Worker’s Justice Project said all delivery workers face significant risks and deserve safety, dignity, and respect. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection supports expanding the wage standard. Instacart opposes the bill. The Council’s action centers gig workers who ride city streets, exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes backed the plan, citing needed transit upgrades. The bill’s impact on vulnerable road users was not assessed. The debate centers on funding transit versus burdening drivers.

Gounardes stressed, “It’s more important than ever that we start congestion pricing immediately, before Trump can block it.” The bill aims to fund the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan, but economist Charles Komanoff warns, “You don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.” The measure is meant to reduce traffic and improve transit, but the lower toll means less impact.

The plan, a policy proposal to adjust congestion pricing, comes as officials rush to implement it before a new presidential administration can intervene. The original $15 toll, crafted by the Traffic Mobility Review Board and approved by the MTA Board, promised strong traffic reduction and included credits and caps. The $9 version, previously reviewed in environmental assessments, may lack those protections. Economist Charles Komanoff warns, 'You lose other benefits. Most noticeably, you don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes urges swift action, saying, 'The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now.' The lower toll is projected to improve traffic speeds by only 6.4 percent, far less than the 17 percent expected from the original plan. With less traffic reduction, streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill reads: "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to reducing the maximum time commercial vehicles may park." It limits parking for tractor-trailer combinations, tractors, truck trailers, and semi-trailers to 90 minutes, down from three hours. Council Member Kevin C. Riley leads as primary sponsor, joined by Nantasha M. Williams, Darlene Mealy, Sandy Nurse, and others. The bill was referred to committee the day it was introduced. No safety analyst has yet assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the measure aims to keep large trucks from blocking curbs and crosswalks, where they threaten pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
