Since 2022, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>901 crashes</a> have torn through these streets. <strong>460 people injured.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded limp home, if they can.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, workers. In the last twelve months alone, 157 injuries. Two deaths last year. This year, none yet. But the blood dries fast on the sidewalk. The next call is always coming.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs hit hardest. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans were behind the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks and buses, less frequent, but no less final. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—each leaves its own mark, but the steel always wins.</p><p><strong>The old and the young are not safe.</strong> An 83-year-old woman, dead after a driver backed an SUV into her. A 52-year-old woman, killed crossing at Bay Ridge Avenue. Names fade. The pain does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city claims progress.</strong> Vision Zero. New speed limits. More cameras. But in Dyker Heights, the carnage continues. The council votes, the mayor speaks, the DOT draws new lines. Still, the ambulances come. <strong>Promises do not stop cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders must do more.</strong> Lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Harden every crosswalk. Expand camera enforcement. End the delays. Every day without action is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy, by silence, by delay. <strong>Call your council member.

Mayor Adams called the deal 'a major victory,' but advocates like Eric McClure of StreetsPAC said, 'it’s not enough.' The City Council must submit a home rule message before final passage.

Mayor Eric Adams and advocates want home rule for NYC on speed cameras and speed limits, but Albany resists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez urges lawmakers to use every tool to fight reckless driving.
