Since 2022, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>901 crashes</a> have torn through these streets. <strong>460 people injured.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded limp home, if they can.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, workers. In the last twelve months alone, 157 injuries. Two deaths last year. This year, none yet. But the blood dries fast on the sidewalk. The next call is always coming.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs hit hardest. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans were behind the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks and buses, less frequent, but no less final. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—each leaves its own mark, but the steel always wins.</p><p><strong>The old and the young are not safe.</strong> An 83-year-old woman, dead after a driver backed an SUV into her. A 52-year-old woman, killed crossing at Bay Ridge Avenue. Names fade. The pain does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city claims progress.</strong> Vision Zero. New speed limits. More cameras. But in Dyker Heights, the carnage continues. The council votes, the mayor speaks, the DOT draws new lines. Still, the ambulances come. <strong>Promises do not stop cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders must do more.</strong> Lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Harden every crosswalk. Expand camera enforcement. End the delays. Every day without action is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy, by silence, by delay. <strong>Call your council member.

Obscured tags let reckless motorists dodge cameras and tickets. The problem grows. Lawmakers want stiffer penalties to stop the evasion and protect people on city streets.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0467-2024 sits in the Committee on Public Safety. Introduced June 20, 2024, it urges Albany to pass S.2447/A.5234. The measure’s title: 'increase the penalties for purposefully obstructed license plates.' Council Members Justin L. Brannan (primary sponsor, District 47) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) lead the push. The bill targets drivers who cover or deface plates to evade speed, red-light, and bus-lane cameras. Data shows unreadable plates rose from 3.98% to 4.66% in one year. The city lost up to $38.7 million in unissued tickets between 2019 and 2022. The resolution calls for higher fines, confiscation of plate coverings, and registration suspensions. Lawmakers say this crackdown is needed to keep dangerous drivers from slipping through the cracks and to make streets safer for everyone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'

The clock ticks toward the session’s end.</p><p class=mb3>Bill A4120/S1981, now before the New York State Legislature, seeks a 20% reduction in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by 2050. The measure is championed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and backed by a coalition of local officials. On May 15, 2024, a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins called for swift passage before the session ends in June. The letter states, 'The state Legislature should pass the law before the end of this session in June, which could pivot transportation funding toward more beneficial uses like mass transit and biking and walking infrastructure.' Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key recipient. The bill would force agencies to prioritize projects for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders over highway expansion. Advocates argue this shift will save lives, cut pollution, and undo harms from car-centric planning.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would shift funds from highways to transit, biking, and walking. Electeds from Brooklyn to Buffalo back the move. Streets could change. Fewer cars. More space for people. Lives at stake.</p><p class=mb3>Bill A4120/S1981 aims to cut vehicle miles traveled in New York by 20% by 2050. On May 15, 2024, more than a dozen local officials sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, urging passage before session’s end in June. The letter, organized by Local Progress, states: 'This means projects that expanded cycling infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, and public transit were prioritized over outdated highway expansions and lane widening.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill. Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.' The bill would force planners to consider car miles in every project, shifting focus from car movement to safer, people-first streets. The policy could help undo decades of harm from highways that split communities and reinforce segregation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
