Since 2022, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>901 crashes</a> have torn through these streets. <strong>460 people injured.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded limp home, if they can.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, workers. In the last twelve months alone, 157 injuries. Two deaths last year. This year, none yet. But the blood dries fast on the sidewalk. The next call is always coming.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs hit hardest. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans were behind the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks and buses, less frequent, but no less final. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—each leaves its own mark, but the steel always wins.</p><p><strong>The old and the young are not safe.</strong> An 83-year-old woman, dead after a driver backed an SUV into her.

Still, the ambulances come. <strong>Promises do not stop cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders must do more.</strong> Lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Harden every crosswalk. Expand camera enforcement. End the delays.

The report states the driver’s 'view [was] obstructed/limited.' The truck rolled forward, its left front bumper hitting the pedestrian, who was left bleeding severely from the leg. The driver, according to the report, 'saw nothing, hit something, kept going.' The truck sustained no damage, while the woman suffered a serious lower leg injury. The only contributing factor cited in the police report is the driver’s obstructed view. No victim behavior is listed as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when massive vehicles move through city intersections with limited visibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No replacement for the lost $1 billion. Transit riders and street users face uncertainty. Lawmakers call the move reckless. The city waits. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure is championed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and backed by a coalition of local officials. On May 15, 2024, a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins called for swift passage before the session ends in June. The letter states, 'The state Legislature should pass the law before the end of this session in June, which could pivot transportation funding toward more beneficial uses like mass transit and biking and walking infrastructure.' Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key recipient. The bill would force agencies to prioritize projects for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders over highway expansion. Advocates argue this shift will save lives, cut pollution, and undo harms from car-centric planning.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill. Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.' The bill would force planners to consider car miles in every project, shifting focus from car movement to safer, people-first streets.

Hochul, at a ceremony for 'Sammy’s Law,' said, 'local governments should be making these decisions,' but did not endorse the expansion. The Adams administration and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez have pushed for more cameras. Hochul’s stance signals support for local control over traffic enforcement, but leaves the fate of a broader camera rollout uncertain.

Sponsors want more MTA board seats and a forensic audit. No mention of safety for people on foot or bike. The car threat grows unchecked.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly bill A 9877 was introduced on April 24, 2024. It sits in the sponsorship stage. The bill aims to repeal congestion pricing, add a new MTA board seat for each city borough, and force a forensic audit of the MTA. The matter title reads: 'Relates to repealing congestion pricing (Part A); commissioning an independent audit of the metropolitan transportation authority (Part B); and conducting an environmental impact study (Part C).' Assembly Members Michael Tannousis (primary), Mike Reilly, Samuel Pirozzolo, Michael Novakhov, Lester Chang, and Alec Brook-Krasny sponsor the bill. No safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided. The bill ignores the deadly risk cars pose to New Yorkers outside vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
