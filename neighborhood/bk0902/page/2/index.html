But the cost is still counted in flesh. Four people suffered serious injuries. One was a child. One was over seventy-five. A pedestrian’s head split open at Winthrop and New York. Another, eighty-five, crushed at Hawthorne and Albany. A woman, seventy-three, left bleeding after a car backed into her on Rutland Road. These are not numbers. They are lives, changed forever. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In three years, 771 people have been hurt in 1,340 crashes here. Fifteen were seriously injured. Most were walking. Most were just trying to cross the street.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p>Cars and trucks did most of the harm. They caused 36 serious or moderate injuries to pedestrians. Trucks alone left three people with life-altering wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds, one. Bikes, one. The street is not a fair fight.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, New York can set its own speed limits. But the limit here is still higher than the speed that kills. No new protected bike lanes. No new pedestrian space. The city touts record intersection redesigns, but the blood on the crosswalks says it’s not enough. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders on bringing it back. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>Every day the speed stays high, another family risks losing someone. The city has the power to lower the limit to 20 mph. It has the power to harden crossings, to protect the old and the young. But power unused is as good as no power at all.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand real protection for people who walk and bike.</p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
