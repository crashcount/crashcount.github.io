But the cost is still counted in flesh. Four people suffered serious injuries. One was a child. One was over seventy-five. A pedestrian’s head split open at Winthrop and New York. Another, eighty-five, crushed at Hawthorne and Albany. A woman, seventy-three, left bleeding after a car backed into her on Rutland Road. These are not numbers. They are lives, changed forever. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In three years, 771 people have been hurt in 1,340 crashes here. Fifteen were seriously injured. Most were walking. Most were just trying to cross the street.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p>Cars and trucks did most of the harm. They caused 36 serious or moderate injuries to pedestrians. Trucks alone left three people with life-altering wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds, one. Bikes, one. The street is not a fair fight.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, New York can set its own speed limits. But the limit here is still higher than the speed that kills. No new protected bike lanes. No new pedestrian space. The city touts record intersection redesigns, but the blood on the crosswalks says it’s not enough. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders on bringing it back. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>Every day the speed stays high, another family risks losing someone. The city has the power to lower the limit to 20 mph. It has the power to harden crossings, to protect the old and the young. But power unused is as good as no power at all.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit.

Council Member Diana I. Ayala is the primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors including De La Rosa, Banks, Ossé, Marte, and others. The bill was laid over by committee on February 10, 2025. The measure would take effect immediately if passed. By capping required coverage, the bill may leave crash victims with less compensation after collisions involving TLC-licensed vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The SUV was making a left turn while the motorcycle was traveling straight south. The motorcycle rider, a 35-year-old male, was struck on the center front end and thrown face-first, sustaining severe facial lacerations and bleeding. The report states, 'An SUV turned left. A motorcycle came straight. No helmet. The rider flew, face-first. Flesh tore. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He stayed awake. Eyes open.' The SUV sustained damage to its right front quarter panel. The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified,' but the sequence clearly shows the SUV turning left into the motorcycle's path. The rider was not wearing a helmet, noted after the driver actions. The driver of the SUV was a 32-year-old male, wearing a lap belt and harness, and suffered minor abrasions.

This marks the lowest bus lane mileage since 2018. The matter, titled 'Adams Has Proposed Just 7 Miles of Bus Lanes This Year — Less Than 1/4 of Requirement,' has drawn sharp criticism. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie called it 'unacceptable that Mayor Adams has not prioritized improving bus speeds, service, and reliability.' Scott Stringer accused the administration of using 'community engagement as an excuse to not get things done.' Brad Lander pledged to push for more dedicated bus lanes. Riders like Alex Gean described daily gridlock. The DOT claims more lanes are coming, but offers no details.

Justice deferred.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2024, a coalition of transit advocates and labor unions renewed calls for a Flatbush Avenue bus lane. The campaign, not tied to a specific council bill, has drawn support from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Rita Joseph. The matter, described as a 'no-brainer solution,' highlights slow bus speeds—often under 5 mph—and the urgent need for safer, faster transit. Jolyse Race of Riders Alliance stressed the economic justice at stake, noting bus riders earn half as much as car owners. Mayor Eric Adams has withheld support, citing community engagement and raising concerns about gentrification. The Department of Transportation's plans have stalled under his administration. Healthcare workers and union leaders spoke of missed shifts and unreliable service. Advocates now plan to survey bus riders to show support. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the campaign centers the needs of vulnerable bus riders and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation’s current proposal covers only the northern section, leaving out areas with poor subway access. The matter, titled 'Activists, labor push for expanded bus lane along Brooklyn’s Flatbush Avenue,' highlights slow bus speeds and chronic delays. Joseph, along with Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Crystal Hudson, supports the expansion. Labor unions TWU Local 100 and 1199 SEIU also back the effort. Mayor Eric Adams has not met the bus lane targets set by the 2019 Streets Master Plan.
