But the cost is still counted in flesh. Four people suffered serious injuries. One was a child. One was over seventy-five. A pedestrian’s head split open at Winthrop and New York. Another, eighty-five, crushed at Hawthorne and Albany. A woman, seventy-three, left bleeding after a car backed into her on Rutland Road. These are not numbers. They are lives, changed forever. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In three years, 771 people have been hurt in 1,340 crashes here.

The street is not a fair fight.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, New York can set its own speed limits. But the limit here is still higher than the speed that kills. No new protected bike lanes. No new pedestrian space. The city touts record intersection redesigns, but the blood on the crosswalks says it’s not enough. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders on bringing it back. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>Every day the speed stays high, another family risks losing someone. The city has the power to lower the limit to 20 mph. It has the power to harden crossings, to protect the old and the young. But power unused is as good as no power at all.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit.

The driver had a record of speeding. No law flagged her. Lawmakers now push for speed limiters on repeat offenders. The street stays dangerous. Grief and anger fill Brooklyn.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (May 2, 2025) reports on the fatal crash that killed a mother and two children on Ocean Parkway. The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving. The article highlights the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill, which would require speed limiter devices for drivers with six or more camera violations in a year. Amber Adler, a local advocate, calls Ocean Parkway a 'safety menace' and urges passage of the bill.

The poll, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found deep worry among women, seniors, and Bronx residents. The matter summary reads: '77% of NYC voters consider pedestrian safety a serious issue.' Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death.
