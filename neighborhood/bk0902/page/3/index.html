But the cost is still counted in flesh. Four people suffered serious injuries. One was a child. One was over seventy-five. A pedestrian’s head split open at Winthrop and New York. Another, eighty-five, crushed at Hawthorne and Albany. A woman, seventy-three, left bleeding after a car backed into her on Rutland Road. These are not numbers. They are lives, changed forever. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In three years, 771 people have been hurt in 1,340 crashes here. Fifteen were seriously injured. Most were walking. Most were just trying to cross the street.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p>Cars and trucks did most of the harm. They caused 36 serious or moderate injuries to pedestrians. Trucks alone left three people with life-altering wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds, one. Bikes, one. The street is not a fair fight.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, New York can set its own speed limits. But the limit here is still higher than the speed that kills. No new protected bike lanes. No new pedestrian space. The city touts record intersection redesigns, but the blood on the crosswalks says it’s not enough. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders on bringing it back. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>Every day the speed stays high, another family risks losing someone. The city has the power to lower the limit to 20 mph. It has the power to harden crossings, to protect the old and the young. But power unused is as good as no power at all.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand real protection for people who walk and bike.</p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The piece asked candidates how they would make streets safer for walking and biking. Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Zohran Mamdani all responded. Stringer highlighted his push for protected bike lanes and daylighting. Myrie promised to meet or exceed the Streets Master Plan’s 50-mile annual bike lane goal and to end delays. Ramos pledged 200 miles of physically separated bike lanes and to close network gaps. Lander committed to the Streets Master Plan and fixing greenway connections. Mamdani vowed to use all mayoral powers for Vision Zero. Each candidate supports redesigning streets to protect vulnerable road users. Their plans focus on proven changes—protected lanes, pedestrian islands, daylighting, and bus lanes—to cut injuries and deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver had a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' according to State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The bill would require speed-limiting devices for drivers with repeated offenses, targeting those with 11 or more points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall to demand action. The article notes that auto deaths have outpaced gun deaths in New York City for two years. The bill mirrors laws for drunk driving and follows stalled efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act.

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws. Some opposition remains, but supporters say the measure is urgent and practical.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
