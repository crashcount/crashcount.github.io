It was introduced on December 21, 2022, and filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to illegal curb cuts and requiring local community board notification of curb cut applications.” Council Members Crystal Hudson (primary), Joseph C. Borelli, Justin L. Brannan, Robert F. Holden, and Kalman Yeger sponsored. The bill required DOT to investigate illegal curb cut complaints within 30 days, mark illegal cuts with green paint, and force owners to restore or legalize them. If owners failed, DOT would repair and recover costs. Community boards would get notice of new curb cut permits and sixty days to comment. The bill did not pass.

The MTA pressed on, undeterred.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2022, Councilmember Joseph C. Borelli (District 51) joined a bipartisan group at City Hall to oppose the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's congestion pricing plan. The rally, covered by Crain's New York, featured lawmakers including Robert Holden, Kalman Yeger, Nicole Malliotakis, and Ritchie Torres. The group argued the plan would 'disproportionately harm working- and middle-class New Yorkers, increase air pollution in outer boroughs, and raise costs for businesses and consumers.' Borelli called it 'bad policy for New York City.' The event did not advance a formal bill but marked a public stand against congestion pricing. The MTA and Governor Hochul support the plan to reduce traffic and fund transit. The Traffic Mobility Review Board continues to review feedback. No safety analyst assessment was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
