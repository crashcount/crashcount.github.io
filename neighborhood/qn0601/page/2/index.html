In the last twelve months, two people died and one was seriously injured in 217 crashes. Fifty-seven people have been hurt already this year. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, sons, neighbors. William McField, 55, was riding his motorcycle when a BMW driver chased him down Woodhaven Boulevard. The BMW struck from behind. The motorcycle caught fire. McField died on the street. His son said, &ldquo;my father was very beloved in the community and true to his friends and family&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-road-rage-crash-42-year-old-suspect-allegedly-killed-motorcyclist-long-island-expressway-turns-himself/16249001/>ABC7 report</a>.</p><p>A 23-year-old cyclist was killed at 63rd Drive and Queens Boulevard. Two cars hit him. He died six days later. The police said, &ldquo;It wasn’t clear if any of the men involved in the crash ran a red light&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/02/young-queens-e-bike-rider-struck-by-two-drivers-dies-six-days-later/>NY Daily News coverage</a>. No charges. No answers. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>Crashes are not rare here. In the past year, 118 people were injured. The old and the young are not spared. Nine children were hurt. Seven people over 75. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Trucks and buses are not far behind. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. The council can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. Cameras catch speeders, but only where the city puts them. The law to keep those cameras running is always at risk. Local leaders say, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many&rdquo; <a href=#citations>NYC briefing notes</a>. But the speed on Queens Boulevard stays high. The crosswalks stay wide and bare. The dead stay dead.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand cameras that never go dark. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the sedan 'slammed forward,' resulting in significant front-end damage and leaving the driver with crush injuries to his upper arm and shoulder. The driver remained conscious and was not ejected from the vehicle, but was pinned in the wreckage. The police report lists 'Illness' as the contributing factor in this crash. No other vehicles or road users were involved or injured.
