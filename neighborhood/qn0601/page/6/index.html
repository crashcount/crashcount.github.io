In the last twelve months, two people died and one was seriously injured in 217 crashes. Fifty-seven people have been hurt already this year. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, sons, neighbors. William McField, 55, was riding his motorcycle when a BMW driver chased him down Woodhaven Boulevard. The BMW struck from behind. The motorcycle caught fire. McField died on the street. His son said, &ldquo;my father was very beloved in the community and true to his friends and family&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-road-rage-crash-42-year-old-suspect-allegedly-killed-motorcyclist-long-island-expressway-turns-himself/16249001/>ABC7 report</a>.</p><p>A 23-year-old cyclist was killed at 63rd Drive and Queens Boulevard. Two cars hit him. He died six days later. The police said, &ldquo;It wasn’t clear if any of the men involved in the crash ran a red light&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/02/young-queens-e-bike-rider-struck-by-two-drivers-dies-six-days-later/>NY Daily News coverage</a>. No charges. No answers. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>Crashes are not rare here. In the past year, 118 people were injured. The old and the young are not spared. Nine children were hurt. Seven people over 75. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Trucks and buses are not far behind. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. The council can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. Cameras catch speeders, but only where the city puts them. The law to keep those cameras running is always at risk. Local leaders say, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many&rdquo; <a href=#citations>NYC briefing notes</a>. But the speed on Queens Boulevard stays high. The crosswalks stay wide and bare. The dead stay dead.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand cameras that never go dark. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter’s title: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S.2447/A.5234, which would increase the penalties for purposefully obstructed license plates.' Council Member Robert F. Holden sponsored the measure. The bill aimed to stop drivers from hiding plates to evade speed, red-light, and bus-lane cameras. Obstructed plates let dangerous drivers slip through enforcement, putting vulnerable road users at risk. The resolution supported stronger tools—confiscation, registration suspension, and blocking vehicle IDs—to crack down on this threat.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and others led the charge. The law aims to expose patterns in police stops and holds officers to account.

The bill, before the Transportation Committee, would require licensing and visible plates for all e-bikes, scooters, and legal motorized vehicles not already registered with the DMV. The board opposed the measure, passing a resolution 21-15 (with five abstentions), calling it 'overly broad and ineffective at addressing safety concerns.' The matter summary reads: 'Require registration and licensing for all e-bikes and legal motorized vehicles.' Board members Brian Van Nieuwenhoven and Jason Froimowitz criticized the bill as incomplete and unrealistic, noting it would not solve dangerous operation or enforcement issues. Holden dismissed the board’s opposition as unrepresentative. The board also passed a separate resolution supporting daylighting at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Owners would have sixty days to clear junk, or act at once if hazards loom. The bill died in committee. Streets stay cluttered. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1071-2023 was introduced on June 8, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to require owners to remove disused or abandoned utility poles, wires, and appurtenances within 60 days, and to act immediately if conditions were dangerous. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the timelines for the removal of abandoned or unsafe utility poles, wires, and appurtenances, and the transfer of appurtenances to newly erected poles.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán sponsored the bill, joined by Kevin C. Riley, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Lincoln Restler, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Amanda Farías, and Robert F. Holden. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The bill’s failure leaves hazardous poles and wires on city streets, a threat to those on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
