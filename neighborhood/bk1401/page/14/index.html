Metal tears through fence and flesh. The boy is eight. His mother is forty-three. Both survive, but the scars will last. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>“Thank God they were conscious. She was able to speak to me. The little boy was pretty much in shock,”</a> said a school employee who saw the aftermath.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, Flatbush saw 388 crashes, 292 injuries, and 2 people seriously hurt.</strong> No deaths this year—yet. But the numbers do not rest. Four people have died since 2022. Over a thousand have been injured. Trucks, buses, SUVs, sedans—they all take their share. Pedestrians, cyclists, children—they pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-weight-of-inaction>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Weight of Inaction</h3><p>After the school bus crash, Councilmember Farrah Louis <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>acknowledged the need for more traffic safety in this area</a>. The words hang in the air. Promises are easy. Change is slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> now lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The power is there. The clock ticks. The council can act. The mayor can act. They have not.</p><h3 id=whats-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What’s Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h3><p>Speed cameras work. Where installed, speeding drops. But the law that keeps them running is always on the edge of expiring. Protected bike lanes and safer intersections come in fits and starts. Each delay means another family waits at the hospital.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-action-now>The Next Step: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>Flatbush does not need more studies. It needs leaders to use the tools they have.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Tell them to build streets that protect people, not just cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

In 2022, his team upgraded intersections and expanded cameras. But protected bike lanes and bus lanes lagged. School Streets shrank. Enforcement stayed weak. Advocates and councilmembers voiced concern. Progress for vulnerable road users remains slow.</p><p class=mb3>This review covers Mayor Eric Adams' 2022 record on street safety and transit. Adams promised 300 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of bus lanes by 2025. In 2022, his administration delivered 25 miles of protected bike lanes and 11.95 miles of new or camera-protected bus lanes—far short of annual goals. The city upgraded 1,400 intersections, expanded speed and red-light cameras, and opened 46 new open streets, including Paseo Park. Adams pledged $904 million for the Streets Master Plan but missed year-one requirements. Council Member Rita Joseph praised plans for a Flatbush Avenue bus lane, while advocates like Elizabeth Adams called the lack of progress 'a troubling sign.' Enforcement against reckless drivers and placard abuse remained weak. Citi Bike expansion stalled in some neighborhoods. The administration's actions left vulnerable road users exposed, with safety improvements falling behind promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
