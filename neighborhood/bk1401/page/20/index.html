But the numbers do not rest. Four people have died since 2022. Over a thousand have been injured. Trucks, buses, SUVs, sedans—they all take their share. Pedestrians, cyclists, children—they pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-weight-of-inaction>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Weight of Inaction</h3><p>After the school bus crash, Councilmember Farrah Louis <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>acknowledged the need for more traffic safety in this area</a>. The words hang in the air. Promises are easy. Change is slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> now lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The power is there. The clock ticks. The council can act. The mayor can act. They have not.</p><h3 id=whats-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What’s Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h3><p>Speed cameras work. Where installed, speeding drops. But the law that keeps them running is always on the edge of expiring. Protected bike lanes and safer intersections come in fits and starts. Each delay means another family waits at the hospital.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-action-now>The Next Step: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>Flatbush does not need more studies. It needs leaders to use the tools they have.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Tell them to build streets that protect people, not just cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation began planning a dedicated lane from Tillary Street to Avenue V. Joseph said, "Bringing a bus lane to the road will speed up bus service, while also helping to lower reliance on private cars, which will in turn help lower traffic." The B41 bus, one of Brooklyn’s busiest, crawls through traffic. Mayor Eric Adams and MTA Chair Janno Lieber also back the project, calling it a priority for bus infrastructure. The city will gather community input before moving forward. No formal bill number or committee is assigned yet. The project remains in early planning, with advocates pushing for safer, faster streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The editorial, titled 'Free perking: Pull back run amok NYC parking placards,' calls out rampant placard abuse: 'End this scam.' Restler’s companion bill would reward whistleblowers who report cheaters with 25% of fines collected. Both measures have four co-sponsors. The editorial urges the Council to pass the bills and for Mayor Adams to sign them. Placard abuse fuels lawless parking, endangering pedestrians and cyclists.

The article states, 'This policy is discriminatory and ableist, and harmful to climate goals.' Hanif notes e-bikes enabled her to ride after hip surgery.

She said, "We've designed streets all these years for cars – we need to start designing them with people in mind." Joseph, a former teacher, spoke of losing two students to traffic violence. She backed 24/7 school-zone speed cameras, higher pay and more staff for crossing guards, and new laws for speed humps near parks and hit-and-run accountability. Joseph also called for better public transit to cut car use. She said, "I love it. I would do it," about car-free school streets. Joseph pledged to introduce or support legislation to protect children and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to "prohibit the issuance of private vehicle parking permits and revoke such existing permits," with exceptions for people with disabilities and collective bargaining agreements. Council Member Christopher Marte led as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Brewer, Joseph, Nurse, Cabán, Avilés, Bottcher, Won, Ossé, and Richardson Jordan, plus the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aimed to end a system that let private cars claim curb space, fueling illegal parking and danger for those on foot or bike. It was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. The status quo remains: permits still shield drivers, while vulnerable road users face the risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
