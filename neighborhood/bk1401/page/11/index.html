Another 283 were hurt. Bicyclists were hit 151 times. The city’s own data says it all. Heavy vehicles loom large: buses and trucks account for three of the five pedestrian deaths. <a href=#>Look at the roll‑up</a> (see citations).</p><p>Drivers hit hardest in the evening. Injury counts crest from 5 p.m. through 9 p.m., with deaths peaking at 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. and again at 6 p.m. on different days. The hour with the most injuries is 5 p.m., with 87 people hurt; 6 p.m. follows with 70; 9 p.m. and 9 a.m. both sit high too. The pattern is steady and cruel. <a href=#>The open data shows the hours</a>.</p><p>Flatbush Avenue leads the body count among corridors listed for injuries: 163 people hurt and seven serious injuries, with one death. Bedford Avenue: 68 injured, one dead. Ocean Avenue: 57 hurt. These aren’t lines on a map. They are crosswalks and corners where people go down and don’t get up. <a href=#>See the corridor stats</a>.</p><h3 id=one-corner-one-life-and-a-bus>One corner, one life, and a bus</h3><p>On February 18, 2022, at 1598 Flatbush Avenue, an MTA bus made a right turn. A 72‑year‑old man crossing with the signal was hit. The city records list “Driver Inattention/Distraction” and “Failure to Yield.” He died. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash file is here</a> under CrashID 4504027.</p><p>On October 13, 2022, at Glenwood Road and Flatbush Avenue, a 79‑year‑old woman crossed with the signal. A bus making a left turn struck her. She died at the scene. The file tags “Oversized Vehicle.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Read the record</a> (CrashID 4573615).</p><p>On March 7, 2024, at Tilden Avenue and Bedford Avenue, a dump truck turned right. A 58‑year‑old woman crossing with the signal was killed. The record lists “Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way” and “Oversized Vehicle.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The data is plain</a> (CrashID 4707890).</p><h3 id=dusk-brings-the-worst>Dusk brings the worst</h3><p>The hours stack up. Noon hurts. Late afternoon does worse. The five o’clock hour shows 87 injuries and a death. Six p.m. shows 70 injuries and a death. Seven p.m. climbs to 77. Nine p.m. also 77. This is when kids head home, when workers cross for the train, when a missed glance at a turning lane becomes a memorial. <a href=#>See the hourly distribution</a> (referenced below).</p><p>“Speed kills.” Advocates say this often because the math is blunt. Our own reporting documents it, and state lawmakers have moved on the worst repeat speeders. The State Senate voted yes in June to advance a bill that would force drivers with repeated violations to install speed‑limiting tech. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file S 4045</a> shows Sen. Kevin Parker voting yes on June 11 and 12. The bill targets drivers with a pattern of violations. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Read the vote records</a>.</p><h3 id=big-vehicles-tight-turns-broken-bodies>Big vehicles, tight turns, broken bodies</h3><p>Flatbush’s toll skews heavy. Buses and trucks are a small share of vehicles, but they are tied to three of the five pedestrian deaths here since 2022. The records list right and left turns. “Failure to Yield.” “Driver Inattention.” “Oversized Vehicle.” These words are boilerplate and final. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Each case sits in the open data</a>.</p><p>Flatbush Avenue is the top pain corridor in the dataset. Bedford follows. Ocean is right behind. <a href=#>Flatbush Avenue</a>, <a href=#>Bedford Avenue</a>, <a href=#>Ocean Avenue</a>: they read like a roll call.</p><h3 id=what-the-city-can-do-now>What the city can do now</h3><ul><li>Daylight every corner along Flatbush, Bedford, and Ocean. Pull parking from the crosswalk approaches, block the lines with posts, and harden the turns so buses and trucks slow. The worst harm here happens at turns. The files say so.</li><li>Give long leading pedestrian intervals at the high‑injury blocks. Protect the walk before any turn happens.</li><li>Focus enforcement and routing on heavy vehicles at the evening peak. The deaths show a pattern.</li></ul><p>Citywide action can backstop these fixes. Albany gave the city the tool to set lower speeds. A citywide 20 mph default would cut the force of every crash. The Senate also moved a bill to rein in repeat speeders with speed limiters. Both tools aim at the same truth: slower cars spare lives. Read the bill record for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. Then tell City Hall to use the power it has. <strong>Ask for slower streets now</strong>. <a href=/take_action/>Here’s how</a>.</p><h3 id=sources-and-confirmations>Sources and confirmations</h3><ul><li>CrashIDs: 4504027, 4573615, 4707890 confirm three pedestrian deaths tied to turning buses and a dump truck; 4783016 records a 64‑year‑old pedestrian killed by a sedan on Flatbush at Caton on Dec. 31, 2024. All from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</li><li>Local totals, corridors, modes, and hourly patterns come from the Flatbush roll‑ups in the same dataset window (2022–2025) included in this analysis.</li><li>Senate action on speed limiters: <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>; June 11 and 12 votes show advancement and a yes from Sen. Parker.</li></ul><p>“Criminal charges for him were still pending,” police said of a deadly Brooklyn crash in early August outside this neighborhood. Different corner. Same city. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>Gothamist reported it</a>.

The board wants to upgrade the faded painted lane, which runs west to Flatbush Boulevard, to a 'vehicle-protected' lane. The matter summary states: 'bring much-needed road safety to a neighborhood.' Council Members Rita Joseph and Crystal Hudson represent the area. Hudson's spokesperson called the resolution 'a necessary step to protect cyclists and pedestrians.' Joseph and DOT did not comment. Between 2021 and 2023, Empire Boulevard saw 406 crashes, injuring 29 cyclists and 52 pedestrians. Two cyclists and two pedestrians have died since 2011. Community Board 9 has zero miles of protected bike lanes. Advocates say improvements are overdue.

It orders the DOT to prioritize sidewalk repairs at NYCHA sites, with senior housing first. The bill summary reads: 'establishing priority for sidewalk repairs at developments operated by the New York city housing authority.' Sponsors include Alexa Avilés (primary), Shaun Abreu, Shahana K. Hanif, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Sandy Nurse, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Lincoln Restler, Rafael Salamanca, Jr., and Farah N. Louis. The law also requires public reporting of repairs and timelines.
