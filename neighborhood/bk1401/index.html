Another 283 were hurt. Bicyclists were hit 151 times. The city’s own data says it all. Heavy vehicles loom large: buses and trucks account for three of the five pedestrian deaths. <a href=#>Look at the roll‑up</a> (see citations).</p><p>Drivers hit hardest in the evening. Injury counts crest from 5 p.m. through 9 p.m., with deaths peaking at 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. and again at 6 p.m. on different days. The hour with the most injuries is 5 p.m., with 87 people hurt; 6 p.m. follows with 70; 9 p.m. and 9 a.m. both sit high too. The pattern is steady and cruel. <a href=#>The open data shows the hours</a>.</p><p>Flatbush Avenue leads the body count among corridors listed for injuries: 163 people hurt and seven serious injuries, with one death. Bedford Avenue: 68 injured, one dead. Ocean Avenue: 57 hurt. These aren’t lines on a map.

Noon hurts. Late afternoon does worse. The five o’clock hour shows 87 injuries and a death. Six p.m. shows 70 injuries and a death. Seven p.m. climbs to 77. Nine p.m. also 77. This is when kids head home, when workers cross for the train, when a missed glance at a turning lane becomes a memorial. <a href=#>See the hourly distribution</a> (referenced below).</p><p>“Speed kills.” Advocates say this often because the math is blunt. Our own reporting documents it, and state lawmakers have moved on the worst repeat speeders. The State Senate voted yes in June to advance a bill that would force drivers with repeated violations to install speed‑limiting tech. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file S 4045</a> shows Sen. Kevin Parker voting yes on June 11 and 12. The bill targets drivers with a pattern of violations. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Read the vote records</a>.</p><h3 id=big-vehicles-tight-turns-broken-bodies>Big vehicles, tight turns, broken bodies</h3><p>Flatbush’s toll skews heavy. Buses and trucks are a small share of vehicles, but they are tied to three of the five pedestrian deaths here since 2022. The records list right and left turns. “Failure to Yield.” “Driver Inattention.” “Oversized Vehicle.” These words are boilerplate and final. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Each case sits in the open data</a>.</p><p>Flatbush Avenue is the top pain corridor in the dataset. Bedford follows. Ocean is right behind. <a href=#>Flatbush Avenue</a>, <a href=#>Bedford Avenue</a>, <a href=#>Ocean Avenue</a>: they read like a roll call.</p><h3 id=what-the-city-can-do-now>What the city can do now</h3><ul><li>Daylight every corner along Flatbush, Bedford, and Ocean. Pull parking from the crosswalk approaches, block the lines with posts, and harden the turns so buses and trucks slow. The worst harm here happens at turns. The files say so.</li><li>Give long leading pedestrian intervals at the high‑injury blocks. Protect the walk before any turn happens.</li><li>Focus enforcement and routing on heavy vehicles at the evening peak. The deaths show a pattern.</li></ul><p>Citywide action can backstop these fixes. Albany gave the city the tool to set lower speeds. A citywide 20 mph default would cut the force of every crash. The Senate also moved a bill to rein in repeat speeders with speed limiters. Both tools aim at the same truth: slower cars spare lives. Read the bill record for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. Then tell City Hall to use the power it has. <strong>Ask for slower streets now</strong>. <a href=/take_action/>Here’s how</a>.</p><h3 id=sources-and-confirmations>Sources and confirmations</h3><ul><li>CrashIDs: 4504027, 4573615, 4707890 confirm three pedestrian deaths tied to turning buses and a dump truck; 4783016 records a 64‑year‑old pedestrian killed by a sedan on Flatbush at Caton on Dec. 31, 2024.
