His name was Nacere Ellis. He was hit by a Hyundai Tucson on June 29. He suffered head trauma and never made it home. The driver, seventy-nine, stayed at the scene. No charges. Police are still investigating. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported the facts</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, one person died and four were seriously injured in Westerleigh-Castleton Corners. Nearly two hundred more were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but people do.</p><h2 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. Since 2022, cars and SUVs killed four people here. Trucks and buses injured more. Bikes caused three injuries, but no deaths. The old and the young are not spared. Children under eighteen were injured twenty-five times in the past year. Two were seriously hurt.</p><h2 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have a choice. In June, State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill to require speed-limiting tech for repeat speeders—he opposed a law that would have curbed the worst drivers <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>according to the official record</a>. Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo voted no on extending school speed zones, turning his back on child safety. The bills passed anyway, but not with their help.</p><p>No public statement. No plan for safer crossings. No push for lower speed limits. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a policy failure. Every injury is a choice made by someone in power. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No arrests have been made, but the NYPD Highway District&rsquo;s Collision Investigation Squad is continuing its investigation.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a></p></blockquote><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in the police log.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The biggest gains come in dense city neighborhoods. Diesel buses choke streets with toxic air. Electric buses could clear the air and save lives.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2024, a Carnegie Mellon University study analyzed the impact of electrifying America’s bus fleet. The report, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found that replacing diesel buses with electric models could cut 40 million metric tons of greenhouse gases by 2035. The study summary states, 'America would reap massive public health and emissions-reduction benefits from electrifying its bus fleet.' Researcher Sofia Martinez said, 'We definitely need to be advocates for electrification, and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants in any way we can.' The study urges more federal subsidies to speed up the transition. Even replacing aging diesel buses as they retire would cut 35 million tons of CO2. The report stresses the greatest public health gains would come from electrifying buses in the most densely populated neighborhoods, where diesel pollution hits hardest. The study calls for urgent action to protect city dwellers from toxic air.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council and DOT hold the power. Advocates say language matters. Streets remain deadly. Action lags. Lives hang in balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 8, 2024, Mayor Eric Adams publicly supported lowering speed limits after the passage of 'Sammy’s Law,' which allows New York City to reduce limits to 20 mph on most roads. The law, passed in the state budget, excludes wide, multi-lane roads in the outer boroughs. Adams said, 'I do believe as New Yorkers we need to slow down,' but repeatedly referred to preventable crashes as 'accidents,' a term advocates reject for removing driver responsibility. The City Council must legislate any citywide speed limit change, while the Department of Transportation (DOT) can adjust limits on specific streets after community input. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Speaker Adrienne Adams pledged to 'collaborate and negotiate' with City Hall. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi stressed the need for street redesign and legal reform, noting, 'This is not a problem that goes away on its own.' Despite new authority, the Adams administration has lagged on safe street infrastructure. The city faces its deadliest start to a year in the Vision Zero era, with 60 killed in the first quarter.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 90-day pilot brings discounted rides to the MTA’s tap-and-go system. Officials promise wider rollout. Riders get easier access. The city inches toward all-door bus boarding. Barriers remain for many.</p><p class=mb3>On May 1, 2024, the MTA and city officials launched a 90-day OMNY pilot for 50 Fair Fares participants. The pilot, announced by MTA Chief Customer Officer Shanifah Rieara, aims to expand OMNY access for low-income riders. Fair Fares gives half-priced rides to New Yorkers earning up to 120 percent of the federal poverty line. The bill’s matter: 'New Yorkers who participate in the city's half-priced transit program Fair Fares will finally be able to use OMNY.' Mayor Adams and the City Council raised eligibility last year, but advocates want broader access. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber called OMNY key for proof-of-payment checks. David Jones, Community Service Society CEO and MTA Board member, supports OMNY for Fair Fares and urges non-police fare enforcement. The pilot follows delays tied to vending machine deployment. About 800,000 New Yorkers qualify for Fair Fares, but only 331,000 are enrolled. The city and MTA plan to expand OMNY to all Fair Fares users by year’s end.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a 'federally funded delivery worker charging station and rest stop,' required LPC review due to its location in a historic district. The project is backed by federal funds secured by Sen. Chuck Schumer. Commissioner Jeanne Lutfy said, 'People need to make a living, they need to make a safe living, and they need to be able to recharge batteries, they need to be able to rest.' Vice Chair Frederick Bland voiced support for the hub's function and design. Commissioner Mark Ginsberg suggested minor design changes. Manhattan Community Board 1 opposed the plan, citing sidewalk encroachment and lack of restrooms. The Parks Department will contract the Workers Justice Project to staff the hub.

The bill would create a weekly CityTicket and extend discounts for seniors and people with disabilities. The matter summary reads: 'Expand Half-Priced Fares to Unlock Commuter Rail for Working Class New Yorkers.' Samuel Santaella, an eastern Queens resident, voices strong support: 'Expanding Fair Fares to include the LIRR would revolutionize my options.' The proposal is backed by Riders Alliance and other advocates. No formal council vote has occurred. The act would cut trip times for outerborough residents and make fast, safe rail travel affordable for thousands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Deaths outside cars now make up 36 percent of all road fatalities. Regulators tout small gains, but the bloodshed for vulnerable users deepens. Hit-and-runs surge. Systemic failure persists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 2, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released final 2022 and preliminary 2023 traffic fatality numbers. The agency’s summary highlights a modest dip in overall deaths, but the details are stark: 'drivers had killed more cyclists (1,105) than they had in any single year in the entire history of the reporting system—and pedestrian deaths (7,522) were the highest since 1981.' Vulnerable road users now account for 36 percent of all fatalities, up from 20 percent in 1996. Hit-and-run deaths and serious injuries for pedestrians and cyclists both rose 11 percent. Tami Friedrich of the Truck Safety Coalition demanded urgent federal action, stating, 'No one else needs to die because of bureaucratic inaction.' Advocates and Vision Zero supporters call for systemic reforms—speed limiters, automatic braking, safer trucks, and better infrastructure. Until agencies act, the carnage continues, masked by official optimism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Car crashes kill thousands, but get shrugs. The system blames individuals, not failures in design. The toll is steady, silent, and ignored. Urgency is missing. Vulnerable lives pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This March 28, 2024, Streetsblog commentary highlights the stark difference in national response between the Baltimore Key Bridge collapse and routine car crashes. The article asks, 'What if we treated our national epidemic of car crashes with that same degree of urgency—not to mention that same holistic approach to saving lives?' No council bill number or committee applies; this is a media analysis, not legislation. The piece criticizes how officials and media leap into action for rare infrastructure disasters, but ignore the daily, deadly toll of car violence. It notes that highway expansion is prioritized over repair, and that systemic failures—not individual mistakes—drive the crisis. The commentary urges a shift to a Safe System Approach, demanding the same scrutiny and coordinated action for traffic violence as for headline-grabbing catastrophes. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while the system looks away.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users.
