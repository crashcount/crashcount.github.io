An SUV turns left. The man does not make it home. In the last three and a half years, <strong>four people have died</strong> in traffic crashes in Westerleigh-Castleton Corners. <strong>Seven more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>637 injured, 1089 crashes</strong> since 2022. Each number is a body, a family, a life changed or ended. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, <strong>one child suffered a serious injury</strong>. Another was hit crossing Clove Road. The old are not spared. A 65-year-old man was killed at an intersection. The young, the old, the careful, the distracted—it does not matter. The street takes them all.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapon.</strong> Of the deaths and serious injuries to pedestrians, most came from sedans and SUVs. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes caused injuries, but not deaths. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But in Westerleigh-Castleton Corners, the pace of change is slow. <strong>No local leader has made this neighborhood a model for safety.</strong> The deaths keep coming. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people walking and biking. Install more speed cameras and keep them on. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, described as a 'federally funded delivery worker charging station and rest stop,' required LPC review due to its location in a historic district. The project is backed by federal funds secured by Sen. Chuck Schumer. Commissioner Jeanne Lutfy said, 'People need to make a living, they need to make a safe living, and they need to be able to recharge batteries, they need to be able to rest.' Vice Chair Frederick Bland voiced support for the hub's function and design. Commissioner Mark Ginsberg suggested minor design changes. Manhattan Community Board 1 opposed the plan, citing sidewalk encroachment and lack of restrooms. The Parks Department will contract the Workers Justice Project to staff the hub. The project faced delays but is now set to open in late fall.

The agency’s summary highlights a modest dip in overall deaths, but the details are stark: 'drivers had killed more cyclists (1,105) than they had in any single year in the entire history of the reporting system—and pedestrian deaths (7,522) were the highest since 1981.' Vulnerable road users now account for 36 percent of all fatalities, up from 20 percent in 1996. Hit-and-run deaths and serious injuries for pedestrians and cyclists both rose 11 percent. Tami Friedrich of the Truck Safety Coalition demanded urgent federal action, stating, 'No one else needs to die because of bureaucratic inaction.' Advocates and Vision Zero supporters call for systemic reforms—speed limiters, automatic braking, safer trucks, and better infrastructure.

No council bill number or committee applies; this is a media analysis, not legislation. The piece criticizes how officials and media leap into action for rare infrastructure disasters, but ignore the daily, deadly toll of car violence. It notes that highway expansion is prioritized over repair, and that systemic failures—not individual mistakes—drive the crisis.

The article, titled 'Understanding Car Culture ‘Denialism’ Can Help Safety Advocates Respond,' details how fake experts, logical fallacies, and shifting demands block alternatives to car-centric streets. Council Member Robert Holden is named for pushing e-bike licensing, a move described as 'extremely harmful' for vulnerable road users. The article criticizes engineers and community boards who resist bike lanes and street redesigns. It urges advocates to call out denialist rhetoric and challenge the roots of car-first policies.

Holden (District 30) was spotlighted for proposing legislation to require licensing and registration for all e-bikes. The measure, discussed in an advocacy article, has not advanced to committee or vote. The article states: 'Council Member Robert Holden has proposed legislation to require licensing and registration for all e-bikes. This legislation will be extremely harmful if it becomes law—likely cutting e-bike use, increasing motorcycle and car emissions and traffic, and forfeiting economic benefits associated with micro-mobility.' Holden’s push aligns with car-centric policy, drawing sharp criticism from safety advocates. They argue the bill would endanger vulnerable road users by forcing more people into cars and away from safer, sustainable options.
