Leaders Shrug. How Many More Before They Act?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 18, 2025 <em>(Revised July 31, 2025 – Updated period stats)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Westerleigh-Castleton Corners: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 18, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-deaths-keep-coming>The Deaths Keep Coming</h2><p>A sixteen-year-old boy on a scooter died on College Avenue. His name was Nacere Ellis. He was hit by a Hyundai Tucson on June 29. He suffered head trauma and never made it home. The driver, seventy-nine, stayed at the scene. No charges. Police are still investigating. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported the facts</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, one person died and four were seriously injured in Westerleigh-Castleton Corners. Nearly two hundred more were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but people do.</p><h2 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. Since 2022, cars and SUVs killed four people here. Trucks and buses injured more. Bikes caused three injuries, but no deaths. The old and the young are not spared. Children under eighteen were injured twenty-five times in the past year. Two were seriously hurt.</p><h2 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have a choice. In June, State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill to require speed-limiting tech for repeat speeders—he opposed a law that would have curbed the worst drivers <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>according to the official record</a>. Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo voted no on extending school speed zones, turning his back on child safety. The bills passed anyway, but not with their help.</p><p>No public statement. No plan for safer crossings. No push for lower speed limits. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a policy failure. Every injury is a choice made by someone in power. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No arrests have been made, but the NYPD Highway District&rsquo;s Collision Investigation Squad is continuing its investigation.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a></p></blockquote><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in the police log.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article centers on Ian Lockwood, a sustainable transportation expert, who was hit by a truck towing a boat while cycling. Lockwood blames road markings, not the driver, saying, 'I blame it on that yellow line.' He criticizes the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for prioritizing speed over safety, stating, 'They're there to make them faster.' Lockwood argues that traffic controls shift blame onto vulnerable users and do not guarantee safety. He supports Vision Zero and shared space designs, which slow traffic and reduce crashes. The critique calls for fewer big arterials and less reliance on signage, focusing instead on eliminating dangerous road features.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bus riders like Holly and Frank voiced frustration at stagnant speeds and unmet promises. The Council has not set consequences for missing the requirement.

Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives added, 'The city needs to meet these goals without delay or excuse and stop leaving New Yorkers who walk, bike, and bus behind.' A City Council spokesperson blamed staff shortages and unfilled vacancies, calling the situation 'unacceptable.' The Council urged the administration to fill key roles and meet legal requirements.

No council bill or vote is attached, but the piece draws on federal data and expert analysis. It singles out SUVs as a main threat: drivers are four times more likely to strike pedestrians while turning, and children hit by SUVs are eight times more likely to die than if struck by smaller cars. The article also exposes the frequency and devastation of vehicle-into-building crashes and the false promise of autonomous vehicles.

Congress authorized up to $200 million per year, but only $45 million was delivered for 2023—less than 10 percent of what advocates requested. Projects must cost over $15 million to qualify, leaving most communities behind. A survey found $7 billion in unmet needs for active transportation. Lawmakers included $1.6 billion in transportation earmarks, but most funds still go to highways.

The MTA Board approved a 2023 budget allowing fare hikes and service changes, pending Albany’s action. Chairman Janno Lieber said, "All good things can happen if people are willing to pay for them, or help figure out recurring funding sources, which is what MTA needs to achieve fiscal stability." New York City Transit President Richard Davey explained that peak hour service would be trimmed, with modest increases in wait times, while some weekend service would expand. Transit advocates and union leaders, including Richard Davis, condemned the cuts, warning of increased rider frustration and assaults on workers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani urged passage of bills to freeze fares and fill the MTA’s fiscal gap, stating, "We have to fix the rot at the heart of the transit system." No formal safety analyst assessment was provided, but the debate centers on the risk to riders and workers if service shrinks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The state calls transit taxes its own contribution, shortchanging riders. Lawmakers and watchdogs demand an end to the shell game. The governor stalls. Riders pay the price in service and safety.</p><p class=mb3>This state budgetary action, revealed December 20, 2022, exposes New York’s long-running diversion of dedicated transit funds from the MTA. Under the 1975 18-b law, the state must match local funding for public transit. Instead, since 1995, Albany has counted regional transit taxes as its own share, leaving a $4.9 billion shortfall. State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli criticizes the practice: 'the state has used a portion of these resources... rather than using General Fund revenues as originally intended.' Assembly Member Amy Paulin, chair of the Corporations Committee, insists, 'we don’t have to justify funding the MTA adequately. It is very justified.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls for an end to 'raiding dedicated funds.' The governor’s office has not pledged to stop. The result: less money for transit, more danger for those who rely on it.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, titled "Four Ways To Build A Better Automated Enforcement Program," surveyed 1,500 U.S. adults about traffic cameras. Researchers, including Kelcie Ralph, urge cities to use data-driven camera placement, scale fines to income, and spend revenue on self-enforcing infrastructure like road narrowing. They warn against using cameras as cash cows or funding police and private contractors. The report states: "The purpose of [automated enforcement] is to improve safety, not catch unsuspecting drivers." Ralph adds, "They need to be in places with known safety risks, and it should be a data driven process." The analysis calls for shifting control to transportation departments and removing jail time for unpaid fines.

The bill remains in committee. The measure would give whistleblowers 25% of the ticket, up to $75. The matter targets drivers who obscure or remove plates to dodge automated enforcement. As city and state agencies rely more on cameras to catch speeders and red-light runners, more drivers hide their plates. The Department of Transportation says cameras failed to ticket over 4% of violators last fall, up from 1% in 2019. Advocates accuse police of lax enforcement and even breaking the law themselves.
