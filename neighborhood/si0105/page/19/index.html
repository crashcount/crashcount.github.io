Leaders Shrug. How Many More Before They Act?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 18, 2025 <em>(Revised August 10, 2025 – Updated period stats)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Westerleigh-Castleton Corners: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 18, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-deaths-keep-coming>The Deaths Keep Coming</h2><p>A sixteen-year-old boy on a scooter died on College Avenue. His name was Nacere Ellis. He was hit by a Hyundai Tucson on June 29. He suffered head trauma and never made it home. The driver, seventy-nine, stayed at the scene. No charges. Police are still investigating. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported the facts</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, one person died and four were seriously injured in Westerleigh-Castleton Corners. Nearly two hundred more were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but people do.</p><h2 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. Since 2022, cars and SUVs killed four people here. Trucks and buses injured more. Bikes caused three injuries, but no deaths. The old and the young are not spared. Children under eighteen were injured twenty-five times in the past year. Two were seriously hurt.</p><h2 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have a choice. In June, State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill to require speed-limiting tech for repeat speeders—he opposed a law that would have curbed the worst drivers <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>according to the official record</a>. Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo voted no on extending school speed zones, turning his back on child safety. The bills passed anyway, but not with their help.</p><p>No public statement. No plan for safer crossings. No push for lower speed limits. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a policy failure. Every injury is a choice made by someone in power. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No arrests have been made, but the NYPD Highway District&rsquo;s Collision Investigation Squad is continuing its investigation.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a></p></blockquote><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in the police log.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The NYPD said a 68-year-old woman 'tripped and fell in front of an SUV driver who then ran right over her, dragging her body across a notoriously treacherous intersection.' The driver, a 72-year-old woman, did not stop until witnesses intervened. Despite the Jeep’s record—two school-zone speeding tickets and a red-light violation since August—police let her go without charges. The NYPD blamed the victim, Aurora Soto, for her own death. Streetsblog reports this is part of a 'long and sordid history of victim-blaming.' The intersection has seen 197 crashes and 49 cyclist and pedestrian injuries since 2019.

No council bill number applies; this is a mayoral policy stance. Adams said, “We have not done a good job of speaking to long-term residents on how they want the shaping of their streets to change.” He announced a new door-to-door engagement strategy on Underhill Avenue, after stalling a bike network project for over a year. Adams’s comments came as he defended delays and rollbacks of approved street safety improvements, citing the need for more community input. Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Juan Restrepo (Transportation Alternatives) condemned the mayor’s approach, warning it gives veto power to small groups and leaves the city “rudderless” on street safety. DOT outreach has dropped to its lowest since Vision Zero began. The city is on pace to miss its bike and bus lane goals for the second year running. Vulnerable road users face continued danger as life-saving projects stall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) leads the rollout. The plan covers about 41% of city housing. The official summary states, 'New Yorkers living in smaller residential buildings will have to set out their garbage in lidded bins.' DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended sidewalk placement, saying, 'It is standard practice around the world to put wheelie bins out on the sidewalk rather than in the parking lane.' Advocate Christine Berthet countered, 'While the bags will be easy to move between cars, containers will be much harder. And therefore having them in the parking lane would be a major benefit.' The city will retrofit trucks for the new bins. For now, pedestrians must still navigate bins on crowded sidewalks. The curb stays reserved for parked cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, unveiled by DSNY, aims to move trash from sidewalks into closed bins, targeting cleaner streets and less sidewalk clutter. The mayor said, 'Everyday New Yorkers are tired of the rodents, they’re tired of the trash, and this is a small price to pay on ensuring that you can have cleaner streets.' Council member Shaun Abreu, representing West Harlem, voiced strong support, citing visible improvements from the local pilot. The plan requires smaller buildings to use wheeled bins on sidewalks, while larger buildings would get shared curbside containers. The city faces pushback from some residents, but Adams insists street cleanliness is a top concern. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the move could clear sidewalks for pedestrians and reduce hazards from trash piles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in October 2023, has not specified a streamlined process for licensing. The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy.

Streets, subways, and highways flooded. The MTA told riders to stay home. Buses filled with water. Cars were stranded on the FDR and Prospect Expressway. The event, documented by Streetsblog NYC, showed city systems overwhelmed. The matter summary reads: 'The BQE is flooded, neighborhoods are flooded, the MTA is literally telling people to not take the train, but New Yorkers have yet to hear from their mayor today.' No council bill or vote was involved. No council member stepped forward. The city’s emergency response faltered. Vulnerable road users—those on foot, on transit, in cars—bore the brunt. The mayor’s absence left the public in the dark as danger mounted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states the goal is to 'relieve congestion and improve traffic flow.' State Senator Andrew Lanza pushed for the study, calling the bridge 'very narrow therefore very dangerous.' Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton acknowledged induced demand and said the study will consider all options, including a shared-use path for cyclists and pedestrians.
