His name was Nacere Ellis. He was hit by a Hyundai Tucson on June 29. He suffered head trauma and never made it home. The driver, seventy-nine, stayed at the scene. No charges. Police are still investigating. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported the facts</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, one person died and four were seriously injured in Westerleigh-Castleton Corners. Nearly two hundred more were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but people do.</p><h2 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. Since 2022, cars and SUVs killed four people here. Trucks and buses injured more. Bikes caused three injuries, but no deaths. The old and the young are not spared. Children under eighteen were injured twenty-five times in the past year. Two were seriously hurt.</p><h2 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have a choice. In June, State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill to require speed-limiting tech for repeat speeders—he opposed a law that would have curbed the worst drivers <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>according to the official record</a>. Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo voted no on extending school speed zones, turning his back on child safety. The bills passed anyway, but not with their help.</p><p>No public statement. No plan for safer crossings. No push for lower speed limits. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a policy failure. Every injury is a choice made by someone in power. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No arrests have been made, but the NYPD Highway District&rsquo;s Collision Investigation Squad is continuing its investigation.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a></p></blockquote><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars.

The move aims to beat a federal block but guts traffic reduction. Streets will see less relief. The plan leaves vulnerable road users exposed. The city trades speed and safety for political timing.</p><p class=mb3>On November 8, 2024, Governor Hochul proposed lowering New York City’s congestion pricing toll from $15 to $9. The plan, a policy proposal to adjust congestion pricing, comes as officials rush to implement it before a new presidential administration can intervene. The original $15 toll, crafted by the Traffic Mobility Review Board and approved by the MTA Board, promised strong traffic reduction and included credits and caps. The $9 version, previously reviewed in environmental assessments, may lack those protections. Economist Charles Komanoff warns, 'You lose other benefits. Most noticeably, you don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes urges swift action, saying, 'The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now.' The lower toll is projected to improve traffic speeds by only 6.4 percent, far less than the 17 percent expected from the original plan. With less traffic reduction, streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pollution hits hardest in poor, Black, and Hispanic neighborhoods. The Advanced Clean Trucks rule promises cleaner air and fewer deaths. Industry fights back. Governor Hochul faces a choice: protect lives or bow to polluters.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion, published November 6, 2024, urges Governor Hochul to uphold New York’s Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) standard and the Low NOx Heavy-Duty Omnibus standard. The piece warns, 'Delaying the implementation of any clean truck rule will likely result in the state losing hundreds of millions in health benefits and lead to additional air pollution-caused deaths.' The ACT, adopted in 2021, sets electric truck sales targets to cut deadly diesel pollution. The statement highlights the disproportionate harm to low-income communities of color, especially in the South Bronx, where truck exhaust drives high asthma rates.

The city’s new code ends a brief era of public space for people.</p><p class=mb3>On November 4, 2024, New York City enforced new outdoor dining regulations, requiring restaurants to remove pandemic-era dining sheds unless they met updated design standards. The measure, shaped by a Council law passed last year, forced all businesses to clear curbside setups by November 29. The Department of Transportation banned enclosed structures, allowing only temporary, open designs. As the city’s Dining Out NYC program shifts to seasonal operation, many owners, like John Kastanis of Casita and Jerry Hsu of Alimama Tea, chose to dismantle their sheds early, citing high fees and storage hurdles. Fred Kent, co-founder of the Placemaking Fund, lamented, “We’ve lost a whole era that could have been evolved into something far more significant for neighborhood main streets to thrive.” The curb returns to cars, erasing space once claimed by pedestrians and diners.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

MTA President of Construction and Development Jamie Torres-Springer said, "We're looking at a tunnel at Metropolitan Avenue, which will allow us to avoid street running to make the [Interborough Express] faster and more reliable." Transit advocates, including Blair Lorenzo of the Effective Transit Alliance, praised the decision, calling it a win for speed and reliability. The MTA will assess expanding the existing freight tunnel or building a new one. The engineering and environmental review will take about two years. Funding for the IBX remains uncertain, as MTA CEO Janno Lieber warned that expansion projects could be at risk if the 2025-2029 capital plan falls short. The move removes a threat to vulnerable road users by keeping trains off city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Free parking remains king. Promised microhubs for deliveries delayed. Only a sliver of free spaces become paid. Advocates call the effort timid. The city leaves most curb space untouched. Vulnerable users wait.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Transportation’s Smart Curbs pilot, updated October 29, 2024, aims to convert free parking to paid meters and add delivery microhubs on the Upper West Side. The plan, first proposed in June, promised about 200 new metered spots and 27 loading zones, but only 175 free spaces—one-tenth of the area’s 1,700—will be removed. Microhubs, meant to reduce double-parking and delivery chaos, are delayed until next year. DOT spokespersons Vin Barone and Mona Bruno confirmed most changes are just reassignments, not true removals of free parking. Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS called the slow pace disappointing: “We’ve been super eager to see these changes, see what their impact is and start measuring and observing, so it’s a little disappointing.” Parking expert Donald Shoup urged the city to reinvest meter revenue locally, but DOT declined. The pilot leaves most curb space for cars, not people. Vulnerable road users see little relief.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, covered in committee and public statements, is described as 'transformative for so many New Yorkers.' Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who represents the area, had threatened to oppose the IBX if it included street-running. After the MTA’s shift to tunneling, Holden stated, 'Addressing the biggest issue by forgoing light rail on 69th Street is crucial to earning our support.' The plan eliminates a dangerous section where trams would have mixed with cars, reducing exposure for pedestrians and cyclists. The MTA has issued a request for proposals to design the line and guide it through federal review. The $5.5 billion project’s funding remains uncertain, but the tunnel plan removes a major safety concern for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, not tied to a council bill but crucial for transit policy, states: 'The MTA can't take on any more debt to fill the hole...without dramatically jacking up fares or cutting service.' DiNapoli’s analysis shows that borrowing $15 billion now, plus $13 billion more for the next plan, would force a 16 percent fare hike by 2037. He notes the MTA’s finances are already strained by weak real estate taxes and slow ridership recovery. DiNapoli opposes fare hikes and service cuts, backing congestion pricing and state support instead. He stresses that without new, reliable revenue, vulnerable riders will pay the price. The warning is clear: more debt means danger for those who depend on transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
