An SUV turns left. The man does not make it home. In the last three and a half years, <strong>four people have died</strong> in traffic crashes in Westerleigh-Castleton Corners. <strong>Seven more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>637 injured, 1089 crashes</strong> since 2022. Each number is a body, a family, a life changed or ended. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, <strong>one child suffered a serious injury</strong>. Another was hit crossing Clove Road. The old are not spared. A 65-year-old man was killed at an intersection. The young, the old, the careful, the distracted—it does not matter. The street takes them all.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapon.</strong> Of the deaths and serious injuries to pedestrians, most came from sedans and SUVs. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes caused injuries, but not deaths. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But in Westerleigh-Castleton Corners, the pace of change is slow. <strong>No local leader has made this neighborhood a model for safety.</strong> The deaths keep coming. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people walking and biking. Install more speed cameras and keep them on. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2023, a closed-door City Hall meeting gathered Brooklyn political figures to debate the future of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The event, organized by Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi, focused on whether to reduce the BQE from three lanes to two. Former Brooklyn Democratic Party Chair Frank Seddio opposed the lane reduction, urging allies to resist the change. The meeting excluded some officials who support shrinking the highway, such as Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, who cite environmental and community health concerns. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the city for favoring a three-lane solution and sidelining affected communities. City Hall denied taking a side, stating, 'the decision would be based on a DOT traffic study.' No formal council bill or vote was recorded, and no safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to amend city law to require the Department of Transportation to finish all street resurfacing work within two weeks. If more time was needed, the department would have to notify the community, stating the reason and new timeline. The matter summary reads: 'ensure that all work associated with the resurfacing of any street is finalized within 2 weeks from the start of work.' Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by thirty other members. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst reviewed the impact, but torn-up streets are a known threat to pedestrians and cyclists. The bill is dead.
