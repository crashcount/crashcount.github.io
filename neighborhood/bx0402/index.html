In the last twelve months, 107 people were hurt in 184 crashes. Not one week passes without someone limping away, or not walking at all. The youngest injured was under 18. The oldest, over 75. The pain does not discriminate. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Data source</a></p><p><strong>Serious injuries are rare, but luck is not a plan.</strong> Two people suffered wounds the city calls &ldquo;serious.&rdquo; That means broken bones, torn flesh, or worse. Most wounds are called &ldquo;moderate.&rdquo; The words do not heal. The numbers do not comfort. They only count the bodies.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-dont-change>Patterns That Don’t Change</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs hit hardest.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and sedans caused the most pain. Nine pedestrians were struck by SUVs. Four by sedans. Buses and unknown vehicles added to the toll. No one was killed, but the scars remain. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><p><strong>Speed is the silent killer.</strong> Crash after crash, the story repeats. Unsafe speed. Driver inattention. Following too close. The same mistakes, the same results. The city lowers speed limits, but the wheels keep spinning.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city says it wants zero deaths.</strong> Vision Zero. New speed limits. More cameras. But in Highbridge, the pace is slow. The city passed Sammy’s Law, letting leaders set 20 mph limits. They could act now. They have not. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The rest of the streets are left to chance.</p><p><strong>No bold moves from local leaders.</strong> No public fights for more cameras. No push for protected bike lanes. No outcry for safer crossings. The silence is loud. The wounds are fresh.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every injury is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand 20 mph limits. Demand more cameras. Demand streets where children can walk without fear.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police say Charles Jenkins, 28, collided with a Mercedes, then hit three men and several parked cars. One victim, age 33, was critically hurt; two others are stable. Jenkins faces multiple vehicular assault charges. ABC7 notes, 'Authorities are trying to determine what led up to the collision.'

No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car."
