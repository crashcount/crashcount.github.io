The incident occurred at Givan and Palmer avenues around 2 a.m. Saturday. Police arrested 20-year-old Michael Aracena, charging him with murder, manslaughter, and criminal possession of a weapon. According to the article, Campbell's family said he tried to resolve the crash through insurance, but the suspect demanded money and then opened fire. ABC7 quotes Campbell’s father: "If you have insurance, you use insurance. Stop jumping out of car and shooting people."
