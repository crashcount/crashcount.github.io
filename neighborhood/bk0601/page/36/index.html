Fourteen seriously hurt.</strong> That is the price paid in Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus, and Red Hook since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about the weather, the time of day, or the story behind each life. They only add up.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> In three and a half years, they killed two people and left dozens more with broken bodies. Trucks and SUVs hit hardest. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>One truck killed a woman crossing Butler and Bond</a>. A sedan, speeding, took the life of a young passenger at Court and Atlantic. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A witness once <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>said, &ldquo;I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman.&rdquo;</a> There is no comfort in that image. There is only the truth of what happens when steel meets flesh. Another voice, after a crash, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said, &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous.&rdquo;</a> The words are plain. The danger is not new.</p><p><strong>Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers pay the price.</strong> In this district, 63 people under 18 have been injured since 2022. One elder was killed. Cyclists and pedestrians are struck again and again. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/down-ballot-recap-a-great-night-for-the-livable-streets-movement>Shahana Hanif</a> co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. State Senator <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Andrew Gounardes</a> pushed to renew speed cameras and close loopholes for reckless drivers. But the pace is slow. The city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. Dangerous intersections remain unchanged.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every unprotected crossing is a decision. The bodies on the street are the result.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and real protection at every crossing.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to become a number. The slow grind of traffic violence will not stop until you force it to.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He announced a $904 million budget for safety improvements and said, 'We need to find them proactively, and get them off the streets.' Adams called for meetings with precincts and targeting dangerous intersections. But he gave no specifics on enforcement, legislative changes, or expanding the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Advocates like Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) and Sara Lind (Open Plans) welcomed the words but demanded concrete action, especially from the NYPD. The city’s current laws limit its power to remove dangerous drivers. Pending state bills could help, but for now, the mayor’s promise remains just that—words, not protection for those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called the grade unacceptable, urging passage of his road-sharing training bill and support for Sen. Brad Hoylman’s bill to lower speed limits. Gounardes also pushed to keep speed cameras active. Advocates like Jon Orcutt acknowledged progress, such as the MTA’s bike strategy and new greenway funding, but stressed the need for stronger laws. The League’s summary: 'New York received high marks for infrastructure and funding, and education and encouragement, but got an F+ in traffic laws and practices.'

Andrew Gounardes called for urgent legislative fixes, including road-sharing training, lower speed limits, and keeping speed cameras on.

The bill was proposed on March 29, 2022. It is currently under consideration in committee. The measure’s summary states it would mandate 'directed training with a professional.' Gounardes called out the current system, linking lack of experience to crashes and road violence. Carroll said professional training means better drivers. The bill has backing from the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools and the city Department of Transportation. Both stress the need for real training to protect all road users. The DMV has not commented. The bill aims to close deadly gaps in driver preparation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Bobby Carroll, would require all new drivers in New York State to complete six hours of professional driving instruction before taking the road test. The bill was announced on March 29, 2022. Gounardes slammed the current rules as too lenient, saying, "For some drivers, the first time they take the wheel [as a licensed driver] they are in sole control of their car." Carroll called the requirement "reasonable." Stephen Walling, president of the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools, said the bill would "go a long way towards keeping all New Yorkers safer on our roads." The NYC Department of Transportation called driver education "crucial" for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users, and is reviewing the proposal.

The event spotlighted the city’s struggle to control its own traffic laws. Adams slammed state rules that force red light and speed cameras off between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., calling it 'unbelievable.' He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year. The mayor pressed for 24/7 camera operation and renewed NYPD focus. The council and advocates demand Albany act before more lives are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Senator Andrew Gounardes echoed Adams, questioning why lawmakers outside the city control local street safety. Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement has dropped and pledged to prioritize it.

They want special permits to drop parking. They say parking rules drive up costs, block affordable homes, and fuel car use. The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
