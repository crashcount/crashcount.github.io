The legislative session nears its end with no clear action. State Sen. Jabari Brisport supports the bill, calling for round-the-clock enforcement. Sen. John Liu backs maintaining cameras but won’t commit to S5602. Some City Council members demand that camera revenue fund local road improvements. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried doubts the Council will send the required home rule message in time, while Assembly Member William Magnarelli promises to advance the bill if they do. Mayor Adams’ team claims safety was discussed in Albany, but the mayor himself stayed silent. The bill faces opposition over increased penalties and insurance notifications.

The bill seeks to renew and strengthen New York City’s school speed zone camera program, which is set to expire June 2. The measure would expand camera hours to 24/7 and increase penalties for repeat offenders, including insurance notification and license suspension. The committee and current status are not specified, but only nine legislative days remain. The bill summary states: 'New York City officials are in conflict with state lawmakers in Albany over the future of school speed zone cameras.' Gounardes is confident in renewal. Mayor Eric Adams and advocates want home rule for NYC on speed cameras and speed limits, but Albany resists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez urges lawmakers to use every tool to fight reckless driving.

Gounardes stressed urgency: 'We cannot leave Albany without reauthorizing the speed cameras.'

Mayor Adams and DOT backed home rule, but lawmakers stalled. Senator Gounardes now fights to renew and expand camera programs before they shut off. Vulnerable road users remain exposed. Local power denied.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes’s bill S5602 sought to grant New York City control over its speed and red-light camera programs. The effort failed this session. The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July. Assembly Member William Magnarelli, chair of the Transportation Committee, blamed City Hall for inaction. Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo. Without home rule, New York City’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—face continued risk from political delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Brooklyn Pols: Fix Grand Army Plaza and Make it Safer,' calls for more protected bike lanes, speed bumps, improved traffic signals, and completion of stalled capital work. The councilmembers cited ongoing crashes, injuries, and community complaints about dangerous conditions. They requested a comprehensive traffic study and highlighted support from over 2,000 neighbors and local advocacy groups. DOT responded that it would review the letter and meet with the community. The push comes as past improvements have failed to end the threat to pedestrians and cyclists.
