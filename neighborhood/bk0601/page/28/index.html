Fourteen seriously hurt.</strong> That is the price paid in Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus, and Red Hook since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about the weather, the time of day, or the story behind each life. They only add up.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> In three and a half years, they killed two people and left dozens more with broken bodies. Trucks and SUVs hit hardest. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>One truck killed a woman crossing Butler and Bond</a>. A sedan, speeding, took the life of a young passenger at Court and Atlantic. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A witness once <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>said, &ldquo;I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman.&rdquo;</a> There is no comfort in that image. There is only the truth of what happens when steel meets flesh. Another voice, after a crash, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said, &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous.&rdquo;</a> The words are plain. The danger is not new.</p><p><strong>Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers pay the price.</strong> In this district, 63 people under 18 have been injured since 2022. One elder was killed. Cyclists and pedestrians are struck again and again. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/down-ballot-recap-a-great-night-for-the-livable-streets-movement>Shahana Hanif</a> co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. State Senator <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Andrew Gounardes</a> pushed to renew speed cameras and close loopholes for reckless drivers. But the pace is slow. The city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. Dangerous intersections remain unchanged.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every unprotected crossing is a decision. The bodies on the street are the result.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and real protection at every crossing.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to become a number. The slow grind of traffic violence will not stop until you force it to.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Councilmember Shahana Hanif joined Joseph in criticizing DOT’s lack of transparency. Both called for clear tracking of safety improvements around schools. DOT denied a Freedom of Information Law request, claiming no records exist and that costs are not broken out from its $1.3-billion budget. Advocates and families voiced outrage. The Department of Education also refused to discuss spending. The city’s silence leaves children exposed on dangerous streets, with no accountability for safety investments.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver remained at the scene but faced no charges. Fruchter’s son Lev condemned the New York Automobile Insurance Plan for letting dangerous drivers stay insured. Community leaders, including NYC Comptroller Brad Lander and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, joined in mourning and frustration. Fruchter’s wife Rachel was also killed by a reckless driver in 1997, a tragedy that helped spark Vision Zero. Nearly three decades later, traffic laws remain weak. No systemic change.

The DOT halted improvements at Third Avenue, citing commercial needs and parking. The matter, described as 'Councilmember(s) and advocates call for extension of protected bike lanes and pedestrian safety infrastructure on Ninth Street after fatal crash; DOT under scrutiny for inaction,' has not advanced to a formal bill or committee. Hanif met with DOT officials on January 12, 2023, expressing disappointment at the lack of immediate action. Maria Stylianou of Families for Safe Streets called the current half-measures unacceptable. Community members and activists, including Aaron Naparstek and Sarah Goodyear, condemned the city’s prioritization of parking over safety. DOT says it is reviewing the crash but has announced no concrete plans. The street remains hazardous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both drivers, women aged 36 and 62, suffered bruises to the neck and arm. The report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors for the crash. The sedan was hit on its left side doors and quarter panel. The ambulance took damage to its left front bumper. Both drivers remained conscious and were not ejected. No other injuries were reported.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The council members wrote, 'The parks department has no justification for classifying e-bikes in the same category as SUVs or trucks.' They condemned the blanket ban, arguing it blocks access for delivery workers and families. Joseph and her colleagues oppose the current ban and the classification of e-bikes as motor vehicles. Their action highlights the need for policies that protect and include vulnerable road users, not punish them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Brooklyn pols call for repeal of Prospect Park e-bike ban,' highlights how the current policy keeps e-bikers out of the park, even after citywide legalization. The councilmembers wrote, 'E-bike users include delivery workers who keep us fed, families on cargo bikes, individuals recovering from surgery, older adults, people who live in areas with fewer public transit options, those who want to limit their carbon footprint by not driving cars, and so many more.' They argue the ban unfairly targets vulnerable riders and blocks access for those who rely on e-bikes for work and daily life. The Parks Department’s stance forces e-bike users onto more dangerous streets, undermining safety and equity. The councilmembers call for a new, inclusive policy shaped by community input.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sits in committee. Drunk drivers killed 42 people last year. Officials talk tough but focus on drinking, not driving. The danger remains for those outside the car.</p><p class=mb3>Senate and Assembly bill, sponsored by Sen. John Liu and Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, seeks to lower New York’s drunk driving threshold from 0.08 to 0.05 percent BAC. Announced at a December 22, 2022 press conference, the bill has stalled in committee for years. The matter aims to redefine DWI: 'driving while intoxicated would be defined as anything above a blood-alcohol content of 0.05 percent.' Simon and Liu back the measure; city DOT and NYPD leaders joined them. DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' In 2021, 42 people died in drunk driving crashes, up 60 percent from previous years. Officials promise enforcement and education, but their messaging targets drinking, not the act of driving. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while the law lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
