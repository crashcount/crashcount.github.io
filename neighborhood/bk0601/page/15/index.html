The driver kept going. The rider, a 30-year-old off-duty NYPD officer, died at the hospital, and police later charged a trucker with leaving the scene (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-work-brooklyn/17664404/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/28/truck-driver-arrested-brooklyn-crash-killed-off-duty-nypd-cop-motorcycle/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>6 people killed</strong> on the streets and highways of Carroll Gardens–Cobble Hill–Gowanus–Red Hook since Jan 1, 2022. Another <strong>1,099 people were injured</strong> here in that time, across <strong>2,565 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>“We know how to fix it: safer street design,” State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said at a Brooklyn street-safety rally this summer (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/sunset-park-urges-city-to-fast-track-third-avenue-street-fixes-10986450>BKReader</a>).</p><h3 id=the-highway-and-the-avenue-keep-drawing-blood>The highway and the avenue keep drawing blood</h3><p>The BQE near Atlantic Avenue is this area’s worst hot spot, with <strong>1 death and 248 injuries</strong> since 2022. Atlantic Avenue itself saw another <strong>1 death and 41 injuries</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is not subtle; it’s carved into the map.</p><p>Crashes here spike through the morning and midday. Deaths are logged at 9, 10, and 11 AM hours in the dataset, even as injuries climb across the day (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=trucks-are-big-people-are-breakable>Trucks are big. People are breakable.</h3><p>Since 2022, trucks have been involved in pedestrian harm in this area, including <strong>2 pedestrian deaths</strong> captured in the records. Sedans and SUVs injure far more people, but heavy vehicles leave no margin when they miss (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Named, fixable factors appear again and again: <strong>failure to yield</strong> and <strong>inattention/distraction</strong> are present in injury and death crashes here. <strong>Unsafe speed</strong> shows up in deadly cases too, including an 18-year-old killed as a passenger at Atlantic and Court in 2023, where police cited speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4655140</a>).</p><h3 id=make-the-turns-human-slow-the-straights>Make the turns human. Slow the straights.</h3><p>On local streets, the fixes are simple and known: daylight corners, add leading pedestrian intervals, and harden turns at Atlantic, Court, Columbia, and Smith. On truck routes, tighten curb radii and add protection at crosswalks. Targeted enforcement for yielding and phone use belongs at the same corners. These match the conditions the city’s own data shows here.</p><h3 id=the-laws-on-the-table-and-who-has-moved>The laws on the table, and who has moved</h3><p>Citywide, Albany has already locked in 24/7 speed cameras through 2030, a program the governor signed this June. Sponsors and supporters say cameras cut speeds and injuries; the law is on the books to keep them running (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>The next lever is stopping repeat speeders. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045/A2299)</strong> would require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with a record of violations. State Sen. <strong>Andrew Gounardes</strong> sponsors the Senate bill and voted it forward in committee. Assembly Members <strong>Jo Anne Simon</strong> and <strong>Marcela Mitaynes</strong> co-sponsor the Assembly version, and Simon also backed a bill to expand camera enforcement against obscured plates (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>).</p><h3 id=after-the-sirens-fade>After the sirens fade</h3><p>The officer died on the BQE. A truck driver was charged with leaving him there. The rest of us still walk Atlantic. We still cross Court. The numbers do not blink.</p><p>The laws exist. The designs exist.

New mid-block crossings, concrete islands, and curb extensions aim to slow cars and protect people. Local leaders call it overdue. For years, crashes haunted this corridor. Now, the city moves to put people before traffic.</p><p class=mb3>On July 26, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced major street safety upgrades for Atlantic Avenue in District 33. The project, led by NYC DOT, brings mid-block crossings, concrete pedestrian islands, curb enhancements, and split-phase signals to one of Brooklyn’s deadliest corridors. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push. Local officials and advocates say these changes mark a crucial step in ending the street’s legacy of danger and death.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority. The Council’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move targets deadly corners where cars block sightlines. Sixteen community boards and dozens of officials back it. DOT drags its feet. Advocates demand action.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon introduced a bill to end New York City's exemption from the state law banning parking within 20 feet of intersections. The bill, now under consideration, has strong support: sixteen community boards and over three dozen elected officials have signed on. The measure aims to remove parked cars from corners, a practice called 'daylighting,' to improve visibility and cut intersection crashes. Simon called it a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez has voiced concerns that daylighting could lead to faster, more dangerous turns, but advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans counter that daylighting is 'proven and widely popular.' The DOT missed a deadline for a daylighting safety study but claims it will daylight 1,000 intersections this year. Advocates urge the city to follow the law and protect vulnerable road users at every intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'
