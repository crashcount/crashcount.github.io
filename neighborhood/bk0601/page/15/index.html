Fourteen seriously hurt.</strong> That is the price paid in Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus, and Red Hook since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about the weather, the time of day, or the story behind each life. They only add up.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> In three and a half years, they killed two people and left dozens more with broken bodies. Trucks and SUVs hit hardest. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>One truck killed a woman crossing Butler and Bond</a>. A sedan, speeding, took the life of a young passenger at Court and Atlantic. The stories repeat.

There is only the truth of what happens when steel meets flesh. Another voice, after a crash, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said, &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous.&rdquo;</a> The words are plain. The danger is not new.</p><p><strong>Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers pay the price.</strong> In this district, 63 people under 18 have been injured since 2022. One elder was killed. Cyclists and pedestrians are struck again and again. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/down-ballot-recap-a-great-night-for-the-livable-streets-movement>Shahana Hanif</a> co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. State Senator <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Andrew Gounardes</a> pushed to renew speed cameras and close loopholes for reckless drivers. But the pace is slow. The city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. Dangerous intersections remain unchanged.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every unprotected crossing is a decision. The bodies on the street are the result.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and real protection at every crossing.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to become a number. The slow grind of traffic violence will not stop until you force it to.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

As of 2022, only 4,858 out of 95,129 FHVs were wheelchair accessible, and just 1% were all-electric.

The campaign, led by Bike South Brooklyn, the Bay Ridge Environmental Group, and Transportation Alternatives, demands a 'better, safer Fourth Avenue' with a road diet and protected bike lanes. Council Member Justin Brannan, who represents Bay Ridge, has a mixed record—once supportive, now silent as his term ends. State Senator Andrew Gounardes supports the redesign, citing risks to pedestrians and cyclists: 'the design of the street puts your safety at risk.' The DOT has not proposed changes south of Sunset Park, leaving Bay Ridge exposed. Advocates vow to keep fighting for safety, regardless of political will.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident left a 49-year-old woman in critical condition. The driver, Stanley Manel, was arrested and charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. The officials' statement read: 'We’re deeply saddened and outraged at the news of yet another pedestrian being struck by an unsafe driver in Greenpoint.' Restler and colleagues highlighted the intersection's dangers and the driver's history—35 tickets since 2019, including 26 speed camera violations. They urged support for bills requiring speed control devices for repeat offenders and for Sammy’s Law, which would let NYC set its own speed limits.

Gounardes, representing Brooklyn’s western edge, champions the shift: 'A new approach will not only protect our climate, but also make New York a safer, more affordable place to live.' Analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute projects 593 fewer traffic deaths each year, with thousands more lives saved through active transportation.
