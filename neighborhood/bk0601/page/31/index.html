Days earlier, Monica Chen, a pedestrian, was killed by a turning driver in Bay Ridge. Again, no charges. State Sen.

The measure, championed by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, requires pre-licensing courses and written exams to include instruction on the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians. The bill's summary states it aims to 'educate drivers about the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians and will create a thoughtful road culture going forward.' Gounardes sponsored the bill, which takes effect in January. Until now, the driver's manual offered only a single page on sharing the road. The law directs the state to consult law enforcement, advocates, and medical experts to shape the curriculum.

The bill, led by Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, updates the five-hour pre-licensing course and driver's manual. The matter summary states: 'The law addresses a longstanding gap in driver education, which had previously left generations of motorists with little awareness of road-sharing with pedestrians and cyclists.' Gov. Hochul said, 'It is common sense to make pedestrian and bike safety education mandatory for drivers.' Gounardes noted that driver instruction had not kept pace with the growing presence of cyclists and micro-mobility users. In 2021, driver inexperience contributed to over 2,500 injury crashes in NYC. The law took 11 years to pass, reflecting persistent advocacy for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The developer missed the May deadline for the promised 'Urban Room,' a glass-enclosed public space meant to serve heavy foot traffic. Only a fraction of affordable housing is built. The centerpiece park is missing. Simon demanded Empire State Development (ESD) sanction the developer or renegotiate terms for safer streets and better public space. As Simon put it, 'This is a bad actor that needs to be held accountable.' ESD claims it will work with the developer, but trust is thin. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk in one of Brooklyn’s most dangerous corridors.

The bill required the Department of Transportation to repair any curb deemed a safety hazard during street resurfacing. The matter summary reads: 'requiring that the department of transportation repair broken curbs as part of resurfacing projects.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Schulman, Brewer, Dinowitz, Krishnan, Narcisse, Menin, Yeger, Avilés, Nurse, Gutiérrez, Riley, Brannan, Sanchez, and Louis. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. Broken curbs are a daily threat to pedestrians, especially the elderly and disabled. The bill would have forced the city to address these hazards as part of routine work, but the effort stalled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, announced July 8, 2022, mirrors a Tennessee law. The bill targets drivers convicted of vehicular manslaughter (first or second degree) or aggravated vehicular homicide. Gounardes said, 'If you drive recklessly, you are going to be held accountable.' He stressed the lack of accountability and financial compensation for victims’ families. The bill is limited to drunk drivers for now, but Gounardes hopes to expand it to all reckless drivers who kill. Few drivers are convicted under these charges in New York City. The measure sends a clear message: kill a parent, pay for it—literally and for years.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move follows a decade-long push to reclaim the block, used as both a play space and a parking lot for placard-holding teachers. The matter, described as 'a fully reimagined pedestrian plaza,' has backing from Hanif, who said, 'It’s going be a plaza. It’ll be closed off and won’t have parking spaces.' The Park Slope Fifth Avenue BID and Old Stone House plan to apply for permanent plaza status with the Department of Transportation. Advocates like Kathy Park Price cite placard abuse and safety risks, calling for a permanent pedestrian space to expand the park and protect the community. The DOT has not committed to a permanent plan.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>The 2022 New York State legislative session ended on June 6, 2022. Lawmakers extended and expanded New York City’s school-zone speed camera program to operate 24/7 for three more years. The bill passed, but was watered down from its original form. Other key street safety bills, including 'Sammy’s Law'—which would let NYC set its own speed limits—did not advance. Senator Andrew Gounardes called the speed camera win 'monumental,' while Senator Brad Hoylman said, 'not as much as any of us would have wanted to see, but for the first time, speed cameras are normalized.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives voiced disappointment over the failure of Sammy’s Law, calling it a top priority for Families for Safe Streets. Several other bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists stalled or died in committee. The session brought some progress, but left many dangers unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
