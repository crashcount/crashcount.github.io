Fourteen seriously hurt.</strong> That is the price paid in Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus, and Red Hook since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about the weather, the time of day, or the story behind each life. They only add up.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> In three and a half years, they killed two people and left dozens more with broken bodies. Trucks and SUVs hit hardest. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>One truck killed a woman crossing Butler and Bond</a>. A sedan, speeding, took the life of a young passenger at Court and Atlantic. The stories repeat.

There is only the truth of what happens when steel meets flesh. Another voice, after a crash, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said, &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous.&rdquo;</a> The words are plain. The danger is not new.</p><p><strong>Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers pay the price.</strong> In this district, 63 people under 18 have been injured since 2022. One elder was killed. Cyclists and pedestrians are struck again and again. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/down-ballot-recap-a-great-night-for-the-livable-streets-movement>Shahana Hanif</a> co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. State Senator <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Andrew Gounardes</a> pushed to renew speed cameras and close loopholes for reckless drivers. But the pace is slow. The city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. Dangerous intersections remain unchanged.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every unprotected crossing is a decision. The bodies on the street are the result.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and real protection at every crossing.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to become a number. The slow grind of traffic violence will not stop until you force it to.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill requiring New York to reduce vehicle miles traveled by 20 percent by 2050. The bill, modeled after Minnesota law, is not yet passed or assigned to a committee. It would amend the state’s climate law, forcing transportation officials to align highway projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes warns, 'If we’re just going to use that money to double down on the transportation of the past, on just purely automobile usage, we’re making a great mistake.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit. The measure would require revisions or offsets for projects that don’t cut driving. Gov. Hochul’s office declined comment.

The city’s hand finally moves after years of blood.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced new mid-block pedestrian crossings on Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn’s so-called 'Boulevard of Death.' The crossings, between Nevins and Bond, Bond and Hoyt, and Hoyt and Smith streets, add crosswalks, traffic lights, and ramps. Restler said, 'These new mid-block crossings will create a greater sense of safety and community for Boerum Hill.' The Department of Transportation acted after Restler and others demanded change following the death of Katherine Harris, killed by a speeding driver. DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks. Leaders want more: curb extensions, redesigned crossings, and further traffic calming. Atlantic Avenue remains a battleground for the city’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action. Vulnerable road users face risk if the program lapses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Closures force cars onto local streets. Drivers mount sidewalks. Buses stall. Pedestrians and first responders face danger. Brannan and Gounardes want action. MTA and DOT pass the buck.</p><p class=mb3>On January 15, 2024, Council Member Justin Brannan (District 47) called for a contingency traffic plan to address chaos during Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge closures. The matter, titled 'Bay Ridge pols call for help with traffic build-up caused by Verrazzano Bridge closures,' highlights gridlock and reckless driving on residential streets. Brannan, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, pressed the MTA and DOT for early closure notifications and more traffic control. Brannan warned, 'Frustrated drivers... driving up on the sidewalk... affects not just the average driver or pedestrian but... first responders.' Gounardes added, 'Buses literally could not go anywhere.' Local leaders echoed the need for action. The MTA claimed safety as the reason for closures but shifted responsibility for street management to the DOT. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided, but the call centers the danger to pedestrians, transit riders, and emergency crews.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
