The matter, titled 'Congestion Pricing Opponents Are Blocking Disabled Access to Mass Transit, Politicians Charge,' highlights how legal challenges from New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, the United Federation of Teachers, and others have forced the MTA to halt critical accessibility upgrades. Gounardes declared, 'That’s not gonna happen if the money’s not there.' The MTA earmarked $6 billion for accessibility, aiming to make 70 stations ADA accessible and modernize 78 elevators. Disability advocates like Elizabeth Valdez and Joe Rappaport stressed that most disabled New Yorkers rely on subways and buses, not private cars. Christopher Schuyler noted congestion pricing would speed up paratransit and wheelchair-accessible vehicles.

The bill, backed by New Yorkers for Transportation Equity, was introduced last year and is under consideration. The measure’s summary promises to 'improve air quality and reduce fatal crashes.' Gounardes, representing Brooklyn’s western edge, champions the shift: 'A new approach will not only protect our climate, but also make New York a safer, more affordable place to live.' Analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute projects 593 fewer traffic deaths each year, with thousands more lives saved through active transportation. The bill’s focus is clear: less driving, more safety, cleaner air, and real savings for families.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states: 'Fossil fuel-emitting cruise ships would have to walk the plank and abandon New York City ports unless they plug into clean shore power for energy.' Avilés, at the hearing, said, 'The Red Hook community has not seen economic benefit from this or any other cruise deal—we have seen a negative benefit, and that is traffic, unwieldy, businesses closing because workers can’t get there, honking, car crashes.' The bill also demands traffic mitigation plans for cruise departures. Residents and advocates say the city’s cruise terminals bring only pollution, congestion, and risk to vulnerable road users.

The bill, titled 'Plug it in! NYC lawmakers want diesel-powered cruise ships to connect to shore power or leave,' would force cruise ships at Red Hook and Hell’s Kitchen terminals to connect to the electric grid or be barred from docking. Avilés said, 'The Red Hook community has not seen economic benefit from this or any other cruise deal—we have seen a negative benefit, and that is traffic, unwieldy, businesses closing because workers can’t get there, honking, car crashes.' The bill targets both air pollution and the surge of car and truck traffic that endangers pedestrians and cyclists. Despite a 2017 shore power upgrade in Brooklyn, most ships still idle, spewing diesel. The Economic Development Corporation promises improvements, but locals and Avilés say the city moves too slow, putting residents at risk while cruise companies rake in profits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary notes, 'the neighborhood continues to experience severe gridlock.' Avilés questioned the use of taxpayer funds to subsidize cruise lines and called for accountability. She introduced legislation requiring ships to use shore power and submit traffic mitigation plans. Local business leader Susan Povich described 'hours of gridlock' and 'unsafe walking and biking conditions.' Despite city efforts—more traffic agents, ferry service—streets remain perilous for vulnerable road users.

The report cites the truck driver's errors as 'Turning Improperly' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper,' along with 'Traffic Control Disregarded.'

Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit.

The crossings, between Nevins and Bond, Bond and Hoyt, and Hoyt and Smith streets, add crosswalks, traffic lights, and ramps. Restler said, 'These new mid-block crossings will create a greater sense of safety and community for Boerum Hill.' The Department of Transportation acted after Restler and others demanded change following the death of Katherine Harris, killed by a speeding driver. DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks.

Two sedans collided, one traveling north going straight ahead and the other making a left turn westbound. The driver of the westbound sedan, a 57-year-old woman, sustained head injuries and whiplash, while her 48-year-old front-seat passenger suffered shoulder and upper arm injuries along with whiplash. Both occupants were conscious and restrained by lap belts and harnesses. The report explicitly lists "Driver Inattention/Distraction" as a contributing factor to the crash. No other contributing factors or victim behaviors were noted. The collision point was the center front end of both vehicles, indicating a failure in maintaining proper attention during the left turn maneuver.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Bills A5259 and S2812 face debate in the New York State legislature. If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action. Vulnerable road users face risk if the program lapses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Waterfront neighborhoods pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On January 18, 2024, the NYC Council, led by Council Members Alexa Avilés and Erik Bottcher, challenged the city’s deal with the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) allowing cruise ships to burn diesel until 2035. The matter, described as 'NYC Council oversight and advocacy regarding cruise ship shore power requirements and port emissions policy,' highlights the slow pace of retrofitting ships for shore power. Avilés declared, 'We want a more aggressive timeframe,' and criticized the 2028 and 2035 deadlines. Residents and advocates blasted the EDC for broken promises and ongoing pollution, noting that California ports required shore power years ago. The Red Hook terminal has shore power since 2016, but many ships ignore it. Manhattan’s terminal still lacks the needed infrastructure. The council’s push aims to end years of toxic emissions that harm waterfront communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
