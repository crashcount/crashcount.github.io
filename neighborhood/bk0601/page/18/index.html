The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A witness once <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>said, &ldquo;I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman.&rdquo;</a> There is no comfort in that image. There is only the truth of what happens when steel meets flesh. Another voice, after a crash, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said, &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous.&rdquo;</a> The words are plain. The danger is not new.</p><p><strong>Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers pay the price.</strong> In this district, 63 people under 18 have been injured since 2022. One elder was killed. Cyclists and pedestrians are struck again and again. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/down-ballot-recap-a-great-night-for-the-livable-streets-movement>Shahana Hanif</a> co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. State Senator <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Andrew Gounardes</a> pushed to renew speed cameras and close loopholes for reckless drivers. But the pace is slow. The city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. Dangerous intersections remain unchanged.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every unprotected crossing is a decision. The bodies on the street are the result.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and real protection at every crossing.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to become a number. The slow grind of traffic violence will not stop until you force it to.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Red Hook Civic Association sent a letter urging the MTA to create a regular-fare bus through the Hugh Carey Tunnel. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the push, saying, "The people of Red Hook really deserve this." The MTA rejected the idea, citing congestion in the tunnel and Lower Manhattan. Joana Flores, MTA spokesperson, said it is more efficient for riders to transfer to the subway. Critics, including Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance, countered, "Bad traffic is not an excuse for not improving bus service, it’s an impetus for decongesting the street." Past proposals to extend the M22 or restore the B71 with a Manhattan extension were dismissed over cost and logistics. Advocates argue that buses move more people than cars and that congestion pricing should clear the way for better transit.

The sedan's 18-year-old driver suffered injuries to his entire body and was in shock. The report lists driver inattention and unsafe speed as contributing factors. The sedan hit the truck while it was stopped in traffic. The driver was not ejected and had no visible complaints at the scene. Both vehicles were registered and licensed in New York. The box truck had two occupants and was stationary when the crash occurred.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The move aims to cut deadly conflict between cars and kids. Filed at session’s end, the resolution targets peak arrival and dismissal. Sponsors push Albany to act. Streets remain risky.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0792-2023 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 28, 2023, and closed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction. The council’s action highlights the ongoing danger children face on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident left Jacob Priley, a cyclist and advocate, critically injured. Hanif highlighted the intersection’s deadly history, referencing the 2021 death of Arcellie Muschamp. She pressed the Department of Transportation for urgent safety upgrades, saying, 'How many more crashes until the DOT pays attention?' Hanif noted the recent completion of a protected bike lane on Ninth Street but stressed that more action is needed. She thanked neighbors for their support and vowed to work with the DOT. So far in 2023, 3,702 cyclists have been injured and 22 killed on New York City streets. The city’s pace on safety remains too slow for those at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed at a City Council press conference, would require the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) to mandate shore power use and enforce traffic mitigation plans for cruise ships. Avilés declared, 'Our residents are suffocating and the city must act.' The bill responds to chaos caused by ships like the MSC Meraviglia, which brings thousands of passengers and vehicles, blocking streets and the B61 bus. Unlike other lines, MSC offers no shuttle, forcing more cars onto local roads. The EDC claims traffic has improved, but local counts and residents say otherwise. Businesses see little benefit. The bill aims to cut pollution and congestion, but the city has yet to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Avilés declared, 'No cruise company should be allowed in our city unless they respect the communities and quality of life of our residents.' Bottcher compared ship emissions to 34,000 idling trucks.
