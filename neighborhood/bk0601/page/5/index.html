The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A witness once <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>said, &ldquo;I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman.&rdquo;</a> There is no comfort in that image. There is only the truth of what happens when steel meets flesh. Another voice, after a crash, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said, &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous.&rdquo;</a> The words are plain. The danger is not new.</p><p><strong>Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers pay the price.</strong> In this district, 63 people under 18 have been injured since 2022. One elder was killed. Cyclists and pedestrians are struck again and again. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/down-ballot-recap-a-great-night-for-the-livable-streets-movement>Shahana Hanif</a> co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. State Senator <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Andrew Gounardes</a> pushed to renew speed cameras and close loopholes for reckless drivers. But the pace is slow. The city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. Dangerous intersections remain unchanged.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every unprotected crossing is a decision. The bodies on the street are the result.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and real protection at every crossing.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to become a number. The slow grind of traffic violence will not stop until you force it to.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene; no arrests were made as the investigation continued. The article notes that the intersection is a known trouble spot, with Collins stating, "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The report highlights systemic issues: delivery app pressures, lack of regulation, and a street design that encourages risky moves.

The measure urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to require the MTA to provide free express bus fare for students commuting to and from school. The matter title states: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation that would require the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide free express bus fare to New York City students who take express buses to and from school.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers is the primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Justin L. Brannan, Shahana K. Hanif, Kamillah Hanks, and Tiffany Cabán. The bill highlights the steep $7 express bus fare, which leaves students in transit deserts with few safe, affordable options.

The bill divided the city into zones: the Manhattan core, an inner transit zone with no parking mandates, an outer transit zone with reduced mandates, and areas beyond where mandates mostly remain. The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.' Council Member Sandy Nurse’s district saw mandates shaped by community board amendments, not her advocacy. Dan Garodnick, Department of City Planning chair, said, 'parking and housing are no longer coming into conflict in the parts of New York City that are well-served by transit.' The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others.
