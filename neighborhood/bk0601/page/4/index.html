Atlantic Avenue itself saw another <strong>1 death and 41 injuries</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is not subtle; it’s carved into the map.</p><p>Crashes here spike through the morning and midday. Deaths are logged at 9, 10, and 11 AM hours in the dataset, even as injuries climb across the day (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=trucks-are-big-people-are-breakable>Trucks are big. People are breakable.</h3><p>Since 2022, trucks have been involved in pedestrian harm in this area, including <strong>2 pedestrian deaths</strong> captured in the records. Sedans and SUVs injure far more people, but heavy vehicles leave no margin when they miss (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Named, fixable factors appear again and again: <strong>failure to yield</strong> and <strong>inattention/distraction</strong> are present in injury and death crashes here. <strong>Unsafe speed</strong> shows up in deadly cases too, including an 18-year-old killed as a passenger at Atlantic and Court in 2023, where police cited speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4655140</a>).</p><h3 id=make-the-turns-human-slow-the-straights>Make the turns human. Slow the straights.</h3><p>On local streets, the fixes are simple and known: daylight corners, add leading pedestrian intervals, and harden turns at Atlantic, Court, Columbia, and Smith. On truck routes, tighten curb radii and add protection at crosswalks. Targeted enforcement for yielding and phone use belongs at the same corners. These match the conditions the city’s own data shows here.</p><h3 id=the-laws-on-the-table-and-who-has-moved>The laws on the table, and who has moved</h3><p>Citywide, Albany has already locked in 24/7 speed cameras through 2030, a program the governor signed this June. Sponsors and supporters say cameras cut speeds and injuries; the law is on the books to keep them running (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>The next lever is stopping repeat speeders. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045/A2299)</strong> would require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with a record of violations. State Sen. <strong>Andrew Gounardes</strong> sponsors the Senate bill and voted it forward in committee. Assembly Members <strong>Jo Anne Simon</strong> and <strong>Marcela Mitaynes</strong> co-sponsor the Assembly version, and Simon also backed a bill to expand camera enforcement against obscured plates (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>).</p><h3 id=after-the-sirens-fade>After the sirens fade</h3><p>The officer died on the BQE. A truck driver was charged with leaving him there. The rest of us still walk Atlantic. We still cross Court. The numbers do not blink.</p><p>The laws exist. The designs exist. The names will, too, if nothing changes. Tell City Hall and Albany to use the tools they already have.

Prosecutors say Pigford rear-ended Cifuni, then stopped two blocks away. When Cifuni approached, Pigford 'refused to roll down her window or speak,' then accelerated, striking and dragging Cifuni. The article quotes Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle.' Pigford then made an illegal turn and fled. The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run driving and the dangers posed by unlicensed, reckless drivers operating stolen vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers extend the city’s program to 2030. Cameras catch speeders near schools. Streets get safer for walkers and riders. Fewer crashes, fewer deaths. A hard-won victory for the vulnerable. The fight against traffic violence continues.</p><p class=mb3>""The verdict came in a long time ago: speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone... At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I'm proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years."" -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the New York State Legislature reauthorized the city’s speed camera program for five more years, extending it until July 1, 2030. The bill passed both the Senate and Assembly and awaits Governor Hochul’s signature. The measure, described as 'possibly the most important street safety law on the books,' covers 750 school zones. Sen. Andrew Gounardes praised the program, saying, 'speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez credited advocates and lawmakers for the renewal. Amy Sohn supported the move. Safety analysts note that speed cameras reduce vehicle speeds and crashes, improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists without burdening them. The reauthorization marks a rare, clear win for vulnerable road users in the city’s ongoing battle against traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lane stays for now. Cyclists and pedestrians remain shielded. The fight over safety and street space continues. The city must wait for court.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 18, 2025, that Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Carolyn Walker-Diallo blocked Mayor Adams from removing the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. The city must wait until an August hearing before making changes. The ruling follows a lawsuit by Transportation Alternatives, who argued Adams 'abused his discretion' by ordering the lane reverted to its unprotected design. The city had cited community feedback and a viral video of a child struck by an e-bike as reasons for removal. The Department of Transportation installed the protected lane after five pedestrian deaths in 2021 and 2022. Local lawmakers protested the removal, calling the process hasty. The judge’s order keeps the safety improvements in place, pausing the city’s plan to restore curbside parking and expose cyclists to traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp.

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.'
