Dead at the scene. An 18-year-old, riding in a car on Atlantic Avenue, killed by speed. A 73-year-old man, behind the wheel on the BQE, lost consciousness and never woke up. A 38-year-old, head trauma, dead on Hicks Street.

The street does not care.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price><strong>Who Pays the Price</strong></h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the damage.</strong> Sedans and SUVs hit hardest, leaving bodies broken and lives ended.
