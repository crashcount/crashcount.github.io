The driver kept going. The rider, a 30-year-old off-duty NYPD officer, died at the hospital, and police later charged a trucker with leaving the scene (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-work-brooklyn/17664404/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/28/truck-driver-arrested-brooklyn-crash-killed-off-duty-nypd-cop-motorcycle/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>6 people killed</strong> on the streets and highways of Carroll Gardens–Cobble Hill–Gowanus–Red Hook since Jan 1, 2022. Another <strong>1,099 people were injured</strong> here in that time, across <strong>2,565 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>“We know how to fix it: safer street design,” State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said at a Brooklyn street-safety rally this summer (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/sunset-park-urges-city-to-fast-track-third-avenue-street-fixes-10986450>BKReader</a>).</p><h3 id=the-highway-and-the-avenue-keep-drawing-blood>The highway and the avenue keep drawing blood</h3><p>The BQE near Atlantic Avenue is this area’s worst hot spot, with <strong>1 death and 248 injuries</strong> since 2022. Atlantic Avenue itself saw another <strong>1 death and 41 injuries</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is not subtle; it’s carved into the map.</p><p>Crashes here spike through the morning and midday. Deaths are logged at 9, 10, and 11 AM hours in the dataset, even as injuries climb across the day (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=trucks-are-big-people-are-breakable>Trucks are big. People are breakable.</h3><p>Since 2022, trucks have been involved in pedestrian harm in this area, including <strong>2 pedestrian deaths</strong> captured in the records. Sedans and SUVs injure far more people, but heavy vehicles leave no margin when they miss (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Named, fixable factors appear again and again: <strong>failure to yield</strong> and <strong>inattention/distraction</strong> are present in injury and death crashes here. <strong>Unsafe speed</strong> shows up in deadly cases too, including an 18-year-old killed as a passenger at Atlantic and Court in 2023, where police cited speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4655140</a>).</p><h3 id=make-the-turns-human-slow-the-straights>Make the turns human. Slow the straights.</h3><p>On local streets, the fixes are simple and known: daylight corners, add leading pedestrian intervals, and harden turns at Atlantic, Court, Columbia, and Smith. On truck routes, tighten curb radii and add protection at crosswalks. Targeted enforcement for yielding and phone use belongs at the same corners. These match the conditions the city’s own data shows here.</p><h3 id=the-laws-on-the-table-and-who-has-moved>The laws on the table, and who has moved</h3><p>Citywide, Albany has already locked in 24/7 speed cameras through 2030, a program the governor signed this June. Sponsors and supporters say cameras cut speeds and injuries; the law is on the books to keep them running (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>The next lever is stopping repeat speeders. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045/A2299)</strong> would require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with a record of violations. State Sen. <strong>Andrew Gounardes</strong> sponsors the Senate bill and voted it forward in committee. Assembly Members <strong>Jo Anne Simon</strong> and <strong>Marcela Mitaynes</strong> co-sponsor the Assembly version, and Simon also backed a bill to expand camera enforcement against obscured plates (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>).</p><h3 id=after-the-sirens-fade>After the sirens fade</h3><p>The officer died on the BQE. A truck driver was charged with leaving him there. The rest of us still walk Atlantic. We still cross Court. The numbers do not blink.</p><p>The laws exist. The designs exist. The names will, too, if nothing changes. Tell City Hall and Albany to use the tools they already have.

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, states the state DOT will only provide technical help to the city’s study of the 1.5-mile city-owned segment between Atlantic Avenue and Sands Street. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the state’s lack of engagement: 'The state hasn't engaged in any way shape or form.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said her community wants the BQE 'revisioned and totally changed,' citing environmental and health impacts. Assembly Member Robert Carroll warned that lack of coordination could worsen problems. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon echoed fears that her constituents would be left behind. The city, under Mayor Adams, has pledged a 'corridor-wide vision,' but admits nothing comprehensive can happen without state DOT. No safety analyst has assessed the impact, but the state’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Rita Joseph demands answers. Streets with schools see more crashes, more injuries. The agency refuses to break out costs or salaries. Families and advocates call for transparency. Children remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On January 25, 2023, the City Council, led by Education Committee Chair Rita Joseph (District 40), pressed the Department of Transportation for transparency on school street safety spending. The matter, titled 'How Much Does DOT Spend to Keep Kids Safe Outside of Schools? The Agency Won’t Say,' exposes DOT’s refusal to disclose project costs or School Safety Unit salaries. Joseph expressed disappointment: 'New Yorkers deserve to know how the DOT is working to make school streets safer.' Councilmember Shahana Hanif also criticized DOT’s inability to track safety projects. Despite Commissioner Rodriguez’s promise of 100 safety projects, the agency denied a FOIL request, claiming costs are not tracked. Advocates and families condemned the lack of accountability. The Department of Education also refused to comment. The city’s silence leaves children exposed on dangerous streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
