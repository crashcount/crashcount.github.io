In the last twelve months, 224 people were hurt in crashes here. Three were left with serious injuries. Children, elders, men and women—no one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crashes come day and night</a>. A 71-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, was struck and left unconscious at Jerome and Burnside. A man’s leg crushed, a head split open, a life changed in seconds. The numbers pile up. The pain does not end.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they caused 32 pedestrian injuries, including four serious ones. Motorcycles and mopeds hit 13, leaving one with a serious injury. Bikes hurt two. Trucks, buses, and even an ambulance added to the count. No one walks these streets without risk.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They say the streets are safer. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But in Mount Hope, the danger remains. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. They have not used it. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are made. Action is slow. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every injury is a choice made by leaders who delay, who wait, who do not act. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT will study traffic and consult the community.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2024, the Department of Transportation proposed an 11-block, 0.6-mile two-way busway on Tremont Avenue in the Bronx. The plan, discussed in the Municipal Services Committee, would force cars and taxis to turn off, leaving the lane for buses, trucks, and emergency vehicles. The matter summary notes, 'The Bx36 bus, which travels this corridor, is among the slowest in the Bronx, with speeds dropping to as low as 4.5 miles per hour.' Council Members Pierina Sanchez and Oswald Feliz, who represent the area, expressed cautious optimism and called for community engagement. Committee Chair Lucia Deng reported, 'There was zero pushback on the concept of busways or bus lanes.' The committee even pushed for a longer route. DOT will conduct further analysis and present detailed plans to local boards in the fall. No formal safety assessment for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
