In the last twelve months, 224 people were hurt in crashes here. Three were left with serious injuries. Children, elders, men and women—no one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crashes come day and night</a>. A 71-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, was struck and left unconscious at Jerome and Burnside. A man’s leg crushed, a head split open, a life changed in seconds. The numbers pile up. The pain does not end.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they caused 32 pedestrian injuries, including four serious ones. Motorcycles and mopeds hit 13, leaving one with a serious injury. Bikes hurt two. Trucks, buses, and even an ambulance added to the count. No one walks these streets without risk.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They say the streets are safer. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But in Mount Hope, the danger remains. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. They have not used it. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are made. Action is slow. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every injury is a choice made by leaders who delay, who wait, who do not act. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike.

The plan keeps parking, speeds up buses, and centers people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a new two-way busway for East Tremont Avenue between Third Avenue and Southern Boulevard, to be installed in spring 2025. The proposal was presented to the Municipal Services Committee of Bronx Community Board 5. DOT’s plan, first floated in June 2024, restricts the 0.6-mile stretch to buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter summary notes, 'Bronx bus riders are about to get a short stretch of relief.' Council Member Oswald Feliz represents the district but has not publicly supported or opposed this project. Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson, however, called for better bus service, stating, 'We need better buses to move across our borough from east to west.' DOT’s outreach found most shoppers and workers use transit or walk, not drive. The agency chose not to remove parking, responding to business concerns. The busway aims to speed up the Bx36, the Bronx’s fifth-busiest bus, and serve a low-income, car-free majority.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The campaign, organized by Riders Alliance, followed the administration’s cancellation of the busway after pushback from local businesses and politicians, including Council Member Oswald Feliz (District 15), who voiced objections. The letter states, 'We need and deserve a contemporary design that addresses current conditions on Fordham Road.' Riders report 'outrageously slow and congested bus service every day.' The city’s Department of Transportation repainted old bus lanes, but speeds declined. The Bx12 Select bus now averages just 9.4 miles per hour. Despite higher speeds than the city average, conditions remain dire.
