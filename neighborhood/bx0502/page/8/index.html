In the last twelve months, 224 people were hurt in crashes here. Three were left with serious injuries. Children, elders, men and women—no one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crashes come day and night</a>. A 71-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, was struck and left unconscious at Jerome and Burnside. A man’s leg crushed, a head split open, a life changed in seconds. The numbers pile up. The pain does not end.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they caused 32 pedestrian injuries, including four serious ones. Motorcycles and mopeds hit 13, leaving one with a serious injury. Bikes hurt two. Trucks, buses, and even an ambulance added to the count. No one walks these streets without risk.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They say the streets are safer. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But in Mount Hope, the danger remains. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. They have not used it. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are made. Action is slow. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every injury is a choice made by leaders who delay, who wait, who do not act. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Councilmember Carmen De La Rosa, representing District 10, advanced a bill to allow food carts within two feet of the curb, instead of forcing them to abut traffic. The hearing, covered by Gothamist, saw rare agreement on banning vending in bike lanes and bridges, but fierce debate over location rules. The matter summary reads: 'NY street vendors and store owners, sometimes rivals, find some common ground.' De La Rosa’s bill aims to reduce danger for vendors forced close to traffic. Erin Piscopink of the NYC BID Association warned of unclear obstruction definitions and overcrowding. Councilmember Pierina Sanchez, another leader, called for real permit reform. The bills, part of a sweeping package, could come to a vote this year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sits in the Assembly, awaiting committee action. Its summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during an eighteen month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C. Carroll, and Sarahana Shrestha. The bill cracks down on repeat offenders, forcing them to install technology that blocks speeding. No safety analyst note is available, but the bill’s intent is clear: rein in drivers who endanger others again and again.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
