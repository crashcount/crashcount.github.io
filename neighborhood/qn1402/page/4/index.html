But the blood never dries. In the past twelve months, 158 people were hurt in 293 crashes across Rockaway Beach-Arverne-Edgemere. Four suffered serious injuries. Children are not spared: 14 kids were injured, one seriously. These numbers are not just statistics—they are broken bones, hospital beds, and families waiting for news that never gets better.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a cyclist was left with severe cuts to his face after a crash at Beach Channel Drive and Beach 73rd Street. In February, a woman crossing with the signal was crushed by an SUV turning left at the same intersection. She survived, but the pain lingers. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows the toll.</p><h2 id=sirens-steel-and-silence>Sirens, Steel, and Silence</h2><p>The danger is not just for those on foot or bike. On August 4, two NYPD cruisers collided at Rockaway Freeway and Beach 35th Street while racing to a shots-fired call. Four officers were sent to the hospital. As <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>ABC7 reported</a>, &ldquo;The officers were responding to a call for shots fired nearby when they crashed.&rdquo; No civilians were hurt this time. But the risk is always there. Steel meets flesh, and flesh loses.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-bleed>Leaders Talk, Streets Bleed</h2><p>Local leaders know the score. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers called the city’s greenway plan &ldquo;a real opportunity&mldr; to make a profound impact&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>amNY</a>). She has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks and expand protected bike lanes. But the pace is slow. The committee laid over the daylighting bill in April (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>). Promises pile up. The crashes do too.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h2><p>Every day without action is another day of risk. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Push for the Stop Super Speeders Act (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Tell them: enough waiting. The next crash is coming. Don’t let it be your family.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Federal Secretary Duffy objects. Critics say his stance ignores history and safety. The bridge once belonged to walkers. Now, the city returns space to people, not cars. Tensions flare. Vulnerable users watch.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the Adams administration's move to open a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge. The event, not a council bill but a city action, drew sharp criticism from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who opposed removing a vehicle lane for pedestrians and cyclists. The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.' Still, the move restores space to those on foot and bike, challenging car dominance and federal resistance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>""The current state of the Conduit falls significantly short of meeting the needs of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians alike. It's confusing, it's poorly designed ... and we know the lack of sufficient pedestrian and bike infrastructure makes it even more dangerous for the neighbors of Queens and Brooklyn."" -- Donovan J. Richards</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a city-funded public engagement process for a major safety redesign of Conduit Boulevard, a three-mile corridor linking Atlantic Avenue to the Belt Parkway and JFK Airport. The project follows urgent requests in 2023 from Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch. The public process begins in June and may run into 2026. The redesign aims to end decades of danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The department banned bikes from a major stretch of the Rockaway Boardwalk, closed parts of the Hudson River Greenway, and allowed cars back into Silver Lake Park. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, speaking for local families, condemned the boardwalk ban: "It was about the children that take advantage of biking on the boardwalk...We’re now shifting them into the street." Residents and advocates argue these moves ignore years of complaints about poor maintenance and lack of coordination with DOT. They highlight that car-free conditions in Silver Lake Park improved safety, especially for children. Advocates call for shifting road maintenance from Parks to DOT and demand structural changes. The Parks Department’s focus on recreation, not transportation, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, the City Council debated a new bill to bring back year-round roadway dining. The measure, still in committee, follows the 2023 law that limited outdoor dining to April through November. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) leads the charge, calling the current law a 'failure' that 'prioritized parking spots over vibrant streets.' Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Lawmakers and advocates agree: high costs, bureaucracy, and seasonality block participation and hurt street life.

Both bills require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create public trackers for capital projects tied to the Streets Master Plan. Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.
