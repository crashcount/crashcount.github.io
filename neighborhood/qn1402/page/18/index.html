But the blood never dries. In the past twelve months, 158 people were hurt in 293 crashes across Rockaway Beach-Arverne-Edgemere. Four suffered serious injuries. Children are not spared: 14 kids were injured, one seriously. These numbers are not just statistics—they are broken bones, hospital beds, and families waiting for news that never gets better.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a cyclist was left with severe cuts to his face after a crash at Beach Channel Drive and Beach 73rd Street. In February, a woman crossing with the signal was crushed by an SUV turning left at the same intersection. She survived, but the pain lingers. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows the toll.</p><h2 id=sirens-steel-and-silence>Sirens, Steel, and Silence</h2><p>The danger is not just for those on foot or bike. On August 4, two NYPD cruisers collided at Rockaway Freeway and Beach 35th Street while racing to a shots-fired call. Four officers were sent to the hospital. As <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>ABC7 reported</a>, &ldquo;The officers were responding to a call for shots fired nearby when they crashed.&rdquo; No civilians were hurt this time. But the risk is always there. Steel meets flesh, and flesh loses.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-bleed>Leaders Talk, Streets Bleed</h2><p>Local leaders know the score. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers called the city’s greenway plan &ldquo;a real opportunity&mldr; to make a profound impact&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>amNY</a>). She has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks and expand protected bike lanes. But the pace is slow. The committee laid over the daylighting bill in April (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>). Promises pile up. The crashes do too.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h2><p>Every day without action is another day of risk. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Push for the Stop Super Speeders Act (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Tell them: enough waiting. The next crash is coming.

She questions claims of 750 redesigned intersections. Public data shows far less. Most fixes are signal timing, not real protection. Advocates want proof, not promises. Road deaths remain high. Brewer vows investigation.</p><p class=mb3>On October 5, 2022, Council Member Gale Brewer, chair of the Council's oversight committee, announced plans to investigate the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) street safety claims. Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress. Road deaths remain high, and the city lags on legal mandates for bus and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The first phase includes $5 million for environmental review and $30 million for the Metropolitan Hub. The matter summary states: 'converting a defunct LIRR branch into a Highline-style park in Queens.' Council Member Lynn Schulman supports the park, calling it 'shovel-ready.' Borough President Donovan Richards and Assembly Members Jenifer Rajkumar and David Weprin back both the park and the QueensLink transit proposal. Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation. The debate continues over whether the right-of-way should serve parks, transit, or both.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.' The redesign targets a stretch with 222 crashes and 87 injuries since 2019, aiming to end the long-standing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She has praised speed cameras as vital for protecting 'motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists.' Nearly all violations occurred in Queens, where 27 people died in car crashes this year as of July 31. Brooks-Powers’ record now qualifies her for the dangerous vehicle abatement program, which can mandate a safety course or impoundment.

Action saves lives, not parking.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2022, the Council Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, discussed flood prevention. An opinion from a Transportation Alternatives staffer urged the Council to 'transform impervious driving lanes into green climate solutions.' The piece calls for bioswales and greenspace in place of parking, citing the deadly floods after Hurricane Ida. It highlights that 72 percent of city land is impervious, worsening flash floods. The author presses city leaders, including Mayor Eric Adams, to repurpose street space for climate resilience, referencing the NYC 25x25 challenge. The message is clear: 'Our streets can become the solution to climate change and flooding.' No council vote occurred, but the advocacy pushes for urgent, systemic change to protect New Yorkers from future storms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
