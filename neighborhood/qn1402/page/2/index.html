Both bills require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create public trackers for capital projects tied to the Streets Master Plan. Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.

The law, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to tracking progress made towards the requirements of the streets master plan,' demands the Department of Transportation post annual and monthly updates on all benchmark projects—protected bike lanes, bus lanes, signals, and upgrades. Council Member Julie Won led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Ayala, and others. The law requires public reporting on project status, funding, delays, and overruns. This measure brings hard oversight and transparency to the city’s street safety promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In effect it’s not a bike lane quite honestly; no one uses it, they [drivers] park there. We would like to see the hard infrastructure removed." Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that building safe bike lanes requires support from local leaders.

The collision involved multiple vehicles, including sedans and SUVs. Three male drivers, ages 30, 37, and 55, were injured with neck and back injuries, all conscious and not ejected from their vehicles. The report cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors for one driver, while others had unspecified factors. The impact was centered on the front ends of the vehicles. All injured occupants were restrained with lap belts and harnesses, with airbags deployed in at least one vehicle. The driver errors of unsafe speed and ignoring traffic controls directly contributed to the crash and resulting injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

He slammed into Justin Diaz’s car. Diaz died. He was 23. His family buried him with his new degree. The firefighter faces charges. The street remains unchanged.</p><p class=mb3>According to the NY Daily News (2025-03-04), Justin Diaz, 23, was killed when an off-duty FDNY firefighter, Michael Pena, sped through a red light at 83 mph in a 25 mph zone and struck Diaz’s BMW at 107th St. and Northern Blvd. Diaz was heading to work at LaGuardia Airport. Prosecutors say Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and refused a breath test. His blood-alcohol content was 0.156 percent. Surveillance footage confirmed Diaz had the right-of-way. The article notes, 'The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light, prosecutors say.' Pena was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. His license was suspended. The case highlights ongoing dangers for New York City road users and questions about bail and accountability for reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
