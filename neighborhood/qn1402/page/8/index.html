But the blood never dries. In the past twelve months, 158 people were hurt in 293 crashes across Rockaway Beach-Arverne-Edgemere. Four suffered serious injuries. Children are not spared: 14 kids were injured, one seriously. These numbers are not just statistics—they are broken bones, hospital beds, and families waiting for news that never gets better.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a cyclist was left with severe cuts to his face after a crash at Beach Channel Drive and Beach 73rd Street. In February, a woman crossing with the signal was crushed by an SUV turning left at the same intersection. She survived, but the pain lingers. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows the toll.</p><h2 id=sirens-steel-and-silence>Sirens, Steel, and Silence</h2><p>The danger is not just for those on foot or bike. On August 4, two NYPD cruisers collided at Rockaway Freeway and Beach 35th Street while racing to a shots-fired call. Four officers were sent to the hospital. As <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>ABC7 reported</a>, &ldquo;The officers were responding to a call for shots fired nearby when they crashed.&rdquo; No civilians were hurt this time. But the risk is always there. Steel meets flesh, and flesh loses.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-bleed>Leaders Talk, Streets Bleed</h2><p>Local leaders know the score. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers called the city’s greenway plan &ldquo;a real opportunity&mldr; to make a profound impact&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>amNY</a>). She has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks and expand protected bike lanes. But the pace is slow. The committee laid over the daylighting bill in April (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>). Promises pile up. The crashes do too.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h2><p>Every day without action is another day of risk. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Push for the Stop Super Speeders Act (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Tell them: enough waiting. The next crash is coming.

Thousands of jobs vanish. Local companies lose out. Lawmakers in affected districts stay silent or cheer. Trains and buses face deep cuts. Riders, workers, and streets pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, Governor Hochul’s official pause on congestion pricing triggered a $12 billion loss in MTA contracts, according to a Reinvent Albany report. The move slashes funding for the 2020-24 MTA capital plan, which was to be partly paid by congestion pricing. The report highlights that many companies losing contracts are in districts represented by lawmakers who either support the pause or have stayed silent. Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick called congestion pricing 'simply another tax' and demanded repeal. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow praised the pause, saying it allows time to address 'communities' concerns.' Frank Russo, president of Ozone Park Lumber, warned, 'You can't just say, 'We're not going to buy supplies and equipment.'' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany said, 'Congestion pricing is an economic booster.' The pause means less money for transit, fewer jobs, and more risk for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, reliable public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group called for expanded lifeguard hours, more staff, and new public pools. The Adams administration rejected these measures, relying instead on NYPD drones and Parks Enforcement Patrols. The matter, described as 'Body found in fifth apparent drowning off NYC beach as pols call for more lifeguard hours,' highlights the deadly gap in city safety policy. Brannan, along with Council Member Shekar Krishnan and Borough Presidents Donovan Richards and Antonio Reynoso, urged the city to extend the beach season, increase lifeguard shifts, and offer universal swimming lessons. The city has only 870 lifeguards, far short of the 1,500 needed. Vulnerable swimmers remain at risk while officials debate.

The proposal aims to increase housing near transit, allow mixed-use zoning, and eliminate parking mandates. Council Members Joann Ariola and Vicki Paladino led opposition, calling the plan an 'unmitigated disaster' and disputing housing data. Ariola argued, 'That's what they bought in the suburbs for.' Other Queens officials and residents echoed fears for single-family homeowners and suburban 'character.' In contrast, Borough President Donovan Richards's spokesperson and some residents supported the reforms, citing the city's affordability crisis. The majority of public testimony favored the proposal, but entrenched opposition from Queens officials remains strong.

The measure covers just 0.13% of city streets, possibly reaching 0.8% if regional slow zones expand. The first such zone will be south of Canal Street in lower Manhattan. DOT can only lower limits street by street unless the City Council acts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confirmed no citywide bill exists. Council Member Christopher Marte welcomed the slow zone in his district, citing rampant speeding off the bridges. Advocates and officials demand faster, broader action, saying, 'Twenty is plenty wherever you'll find people, and in New York that's everywhere.' DOT says it will prioritize areas near schools and neighborhoods with more non-white and low-income residents. The rollout is slow.

The move falls short of the original goal but marks the largest growth since 1994. Advocates say cameras save lives. Debate continues over equity and coverage.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, the City Council passed a resolution urging the state to expand New York City's red light camera program from 150 to 600 intersections. The measure, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows internal debate and negotiation, with some members pushing for 1,325 intersections and others preferring fewer. The final number represents a four-fold increase, covering about 4 percent of city intersections. The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement. The Department of Transportation called the Council's action a critical step.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
