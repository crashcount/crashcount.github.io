An e-bike slams into her in the bike lane on Bedford Avenue. She goes down hard. The rider stops. The girl is rushed to Bellevue with injuries to her stomach. She survives. The street does not forgive. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>Video shows the crash</a>.</p><p>A ten-year-old girl tries to cross Franklin Avenue with the light. An SUV turns left. She is crushed. She does not get up. The driver failed to yield. The city failed her first. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><p>A cyclist, 46, hits a parked SUV on Lynch Street.

The numbers do not lie. They do not comfort.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting</h3><p>City Hall says one death is too many. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. Cameras catch speeders and red-light runners. The city redesigns intersections. But the pace is slow. The pain is fast.</p><p><strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> But the limit stands. Leaders talk. Streets wait. The law is a tool left on the shelf. <a href=https://nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/2024/sammy-s-law>Passing Sammy’s Law was a critical first step in our effort to build safer streets… implementing reduced speed limits will be a simple yet powerful way to reduce traffic violence and protect our most vulnerable road users," said Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine.</a></p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-left-undone>What Next: The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong> The city has the power to slow the cars. It has the power to harden the crossings. It has the power to protect the child, the cyclist, the old man with a cane. It must use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the sidewalk.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists keep dying.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee considered S533, a bill to repeal congestion pricing, after a procedural motion by Sen. Jack Martins. Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets. Cyclist deaths keep rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Lincoln Restler, a strong backer of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, challenged the ballot access of opponent Sabrina Gates, claiming her campaign misled petition signers. A judge ruled Gates had enough valid signatures. The bike lane, built by the Department of Transportation in September, faces fierce opposition from Hasidic residents worried about child safety. At least two children have been injured by cyclists, fueling calls to reroute the lane. Over 3,200 residents signed a petition against it. Cycling advocates and Restler point to a 25% drop in injuries since the lane’s installation. Gates argues more must be done to address community complaints. The court battle centered on ballot signatures, not the lane itself, but the fight underscores deep tensions over street safety and representation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Parks Department cited a backlog of 42,000 requests and long wait times. Each of the 59 community boards will now get tree services once every nine years. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the policy, asking, "What am I supposed to do, to look my constituents...in the eye and tell them...the Parks Department isn't gonna come by to plant a tree for nine years?" Adam Ganser of New Yorkers for Parks blamed budget cuts and underfunding. Brad Vogel, a Brooklyn resident, called the grassroots request system "critical." The city’s nearly 900,000 trees fight pollution and heatwaves.

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
