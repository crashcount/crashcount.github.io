The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not a council bill but a Department of Transportation decision, extends parking-protected bike lanes from Calyer Street to Meeker Avenue. Councilmember Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, criticized the move, saying, 'The mayor has put forward a compromise that nobody likes.' A coalition of elected officials—including Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso—called for a more thorough redesign, arguing the current plan preserves dangerous elements. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone claimed the redesign will make the corridor safer for all users, with new bike lanes and sidewalk extensions.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) will install a bike lane on the southern stretch but keep two traffic lanes in each direction. The original plan called for a road diet and a parking-protected bike lane. After pushback from business interests, DOT scaled back. The new plan converts the outer lane to parking overnight, a design that has led to illegal parking and safety hazards for cyclists. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the plan, saying, 'this plan fails to dramatically slow down traffic on this dangerous boulevard.' The advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe accused the mayor of breaking his promise to prioritize safety. The compromise removes some parking, which local businesses oppose. Despite DOT claims, the redesign does not slow traffic or protect vulnerable road users as promised. The decision follows years of advocacy after a fatal crash in 2021.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and walkers claimed space. Safety replaced speed.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2024, a one-day closure of Driggs Avenue—dubbed 'Driggs Passage'—cut car traffic through McCarren Park in Williamsburg. The event, not a formal bill but a policy experiment, was championed by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Greenpoint), who said, "Today is a one-day experiment to just experience what it would be like to not have cars flying through the middle of our community's primary green space." The closure united two halves of the park, creating 1.5 acres of new open space. Organizers and residents, including Katie Denny Horowitz of the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance, called for a permanent ban on cars. Since 2020, city data shows 42 crashes on this stretch, injuring six cyclists and one pedestrian. The move echoes past car bans in Central and Prospect Parks, but faces resistance from city officials. The day showed what’s possible when cars yield to people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He criticized the Department of Transportation and MTA for disregarding these requests, leaving shuttle riders stuck in traffic and packed buses.

Kelly Carroll, Executive Director of the Atlantic Avenue BID, added, "We can't even set up a table if the cars are parked there. It renders the open street moot."

The pedestrian was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, and the impact occurred at the vehicle's left rear quarter panel. The pedestrian sustained contusions and injuries to her knee, lower leg, and foot but remained conscious. The report does not list any specific driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding. Both contributing factors for the pedestrian are marked as unspecified. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle going straight ahead. The collision highlights the dangers pedestrians face when crossing outside designated areas, though no explicit driver fault is recorded in this incident.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plaza’s future hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On July 8, 2024, the city made the northernmost block of Bedford Avenue in Greenpoint a full-time pedestrian plaza. This temporary closure, set through mid-August, aims to ease congestion for shuttle buses during the G train shutdown. The Department of Transportation banned left turns and blocked cars, opening the street to people. Council member Lincoln Restler said, 'Having an alternative use for this space during this period for the G train [shutdown] makes a ton of sense. It gives us an opportunity to see how it goes.' DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno said the closure will 'enhance safety and create new public space.' The North Brooklyn Parks Alliance set up planters to keep cars out. A 2020 crash pushed locals to demand change. Over 2,000 signed a petition for a permanent plaza. The move has growing support, but its future is not yet decided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT reviews, but delays action.</p><p class=mb3>On July 6, 2024, Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) called on the Department of Transportation to redesign and expand the Kent Avenue bike lane and sidewalks. The matter, titled 'Cyclists call on DOT to fix ‘chaotic’ Kent Avenue bike lane in Brooklyn,' highlights chaos along the north Brooklyn waterfront. Restler is organizing local businesses to pressure DOT, demanding wider bike lanes and sidewalks, curb separation to block drivers, and safer pedestrian crossings. He says, 'If we really care about cyclists and their safety in New York City, then we should design and implement bike lanes that show it.' DOT spokesperson Will Livingston says the agency is reviewing the proposal but notes the city’s priority is elsewhere. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger: narrow lanes, illegal parking, and forced detours into traffic. No formal bill number or committee stage yet. Restler’s push centers vulnerable road users, demanding the city act before more are hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
