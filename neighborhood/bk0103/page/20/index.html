An e-bike slams into her in the bike lane on Bedford Avenue. She goes down hard. The rider stops. The girl is rushed to Bellevue with injuries to her stomach. She survives. The street does not forgive. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>Video shows the crash</a>.</p><p>A ten-year-old girl tries to cross Franklin Avenue with the light. An SUV turns left. She is crushed. She does not get up. The driver failed to yield. The city failed her first. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><p>A cyclist, 46, hits a parked SUV on Lynch Street.

The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. Cameras catch speeders and red-light runners. The city redesigns intersections. But the pace is slow. The pain is fast.</p><p><strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> But the limit stands. Leaders talk. Streets wait. The law is a tool left on the shelf. <a href=https://nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/2024/sammy-s-law>Passing Sammy’s Law was a critical first step in our effort to build safer streets… implementing reduced speed limits will be a simple yet powerful way to reduce traffic violence and protect our most vulnerable road users," said Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine.</a></p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-left-undone>What Next: The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong> The city has the power to slow the cars. It has the power to harden the crossings. It has the power to protect the child, the cyclist, the old man with a cane. It must use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the sidewalk.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The rollout starts in Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn, expanding citywide over three years. The Department of Transportation must create a mobile app and post signage in reporting zones. The bill doubles reporting zones around schools to 2,640 feet. Restler said, 'The updated version of this bill will prioritize safety by reducing the likelihood of conflict between neighbors while continuing to empower citizen enforcement across nearly the entirety of New York City.' Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers led the committee. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives and Bike New York support the bill, citing the need for civilian enforcement to keep streets safe for vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The meeting drew over 100 attendees. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) voiced concerns about the lack of information on neighborhood impacts, costs, and the city’s refusal to commit to reducing the BQE to two lanes in each direction. The DOT presented three proposals—The Terraces, The Lookout, and The Stoop—aiming to repair the crumbling highway and reconnect Brooklyn Heights to Brooklyn Bridge Park. Restler said, 'We need a commitment that this is the long-term solution.' Residents like Cindy McLaughlin pushed for a walkable, green city, while Amy Breedlove warned that wider highways mean more danger on local streets. The DOT delayed its environmental review to study lane reduction, but offered no clear promises.

Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who introduced the original legislation, stressed the need for clear guidance. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure highlighted the deadly consequences of delay. DSNY opposes a bill from Council Member Sandy Nurse to create a working group to address these setbacks.

Intro 501 would fine drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants, with civilians able to report violations and receive a portion of the fine. Reynoso said, 'Those are two pieces I’d love to see pushed absolutely.' He also champions protected bike lanes, a comprehensive bike network, and the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway. Reynoso’s stance is clear: streets must be safer for people walking and biking. He wants action after recent traffic violence and supports more open streets.
