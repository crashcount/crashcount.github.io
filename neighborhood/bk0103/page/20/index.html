Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry.

Council Member Lincoln Restler promised to 'push like all hell' for changes at Monitor and Driggs by September.

Council Member Lincoln Restler voiced 'disappointment' over DOT's delay in automated truck weight enforcement. The Adams administration is considering a full six-lane rebuild, which Simon says would be 'just as polluting and climate insensitive.' DOT claims the BQE is safe and promises interim repairs, but work on a permanent fix may not start until 2027. Local officials expect more delays due to community opposition and litigation.

Pedestrians and riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On May 24, 2023, the New York City Department of Transportation announced plans to allow cyclists to proceed through stop signs and red lights at certain intersections, including 'Top of the T' crossings and right turns on red after yielding. Council Member Lincoln Restler introduced a resolution urging the state to pass the 'Idaho Stop' law, which would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs. Restler said, 'This would allow bikers to treat red lights as stop signs making cycling safer and bringing us one step closer to Vision Zero!' DOT spokesman Vin Barone confirmed the agency's intent to pursue these changes, though similar efforts have failed before. The Council resolution has little support, and state bills remain stuck in committee. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk while cars dominate the streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law was introduced on October 27, 2022, passed on May 29, 2023, and returned unsigned by the mayor. The bill amends the administrative code to require the Department of Transportation to conduct a comprehensive study of all pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries every three years, instead of every five. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian safety reporting.' Sponsors include Alexa Avilés (primary), Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Crystal Hudson, Amanda Farías, Tiffany Cabán, Lynn C. Schulman, Kalman Yeger, Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, Darlene Mealy, Eric Dinowitz, Linda Lee, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Carlina Rivera, Mercedes Narcisse, and Rita C. Joseph. The law mandates that crash reports and recommendations be sent to council members, community boards, and made public. This change increases transparency and keeps the focus on the deadly toll of cars in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
