An e-bike slams into her in the bike lane on Bedford Avenue. She goes down hard. The rider stops. The girl is rushed to Bellevue with injuries to her stomach. She survives. The street does not forgive. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>Video shows the crash</a>.</p><p>A ten-year-old girl tries to cross Franklin Avenue with the light.

The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. Cameras catch speeders and red-light runners. The city redesigns intersections. But the pace is slow. The pain is fast.</p><p><strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> But the limit stands. Leaders talk. Streets wait. The law is a tool left on the shelf. <a href=https://nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/2024/sammy-s-law>Passing Sammy’s Law was a critical first step in our effort to build safer streets… implementing reduced speed limits will be a simple yet powerful way to reduce traffic violence and protect our most vulnerable road users," said Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine.</a></p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-left-undone>What Next: The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong> The city has the power to slow the cars. It has the power to harden the crossings. It has the power to protect the child, the cyclist, the old man with a cane. It must use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the sidewalk.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure, previously stripped down in committee, now returns to its original form. The matter title: 'Prophet Motive: Restler Bill Would Restore 25% Bounty for Blocked Bike and Bus Lane Tickets.' Restler vows to push hard for passage, saying, 'This bill would make a tremendous difference in making our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.' The bill’s fate is uncertain after Restler’s removal from the Transportation Committee, but the intent is clear: shift enforcement from NYPD to the people, and clear the way for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move shifted Restler, known for championing safe streets, to chair the Governmental Operations, State and Federal Legislation Committee. The matter summary notes Restler's intent to remain active: 'I am reintroducing 501, the citizen reporting bill, and will push as hard as I can to get it over the finish line.' Restler has sponsored bills to curb illegal parking, speed up bike lane installations, and fight placard abuse. Despite his removal, advocates and colleagues, including Jon Orcutt, voiced confidence that Restler will continue to fight for pedestrian and cyclist safety. The committee change may slow progress on key safety bills, but Restler's record and resolve remain strong.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, backed by a $368 million contract, aims to modernize signals along the Crosstown Line. The MTA proposes closures starting June 28, with shuttle buses replacing trains. Restler called CBTC 'a vital investment' but warned that 'a full shutdown of the G train in Greenpoint for six weeks would cause harm and disruption to our community.' He urged the MTA to 'act nimbly and find alternative construction approaches.' The G train is a lifeline for thousands in Greenpoint. The closure will push more people onto streets and buses, raising risks for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger shifts.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2024, the city completed a new busway on Livingston Street in Brooklyn. The project, not tied to a specific bill number, was led by the Department of Transportation and praised by Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33). The redesign turned a congested, two-way street into a one-way westbound corridor with two directions of physically-separated, dedicated bus lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the project 'transformed what was a congested, double-parked corridor into two-way fully protected and dedicated bus lanes.' Restler declared, 'Those days are over with the new Livingston Busway!' The project aims to speed up service for 50,000 daily riders and keep cars out of bus lanes with concrete boarding islands. While the article notes ongoing issues with illegal parking and citywide delays, the Livingston Street busway stands as a rare win for bus riders and vulnerable street users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
