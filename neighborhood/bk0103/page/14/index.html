Eight have been seriously hurt.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. Since 2022, South Williamsburg has seen 1,380 crashes. Most victims were walking or riding. Some were children. Some were old. The street does not care.</p><p>Last year, a 10-year-old girl was killed crossing with the signal at Franklin and Wallabout. The driver turned left in an SUV. She never made it to the other side. The city called it failure to yield. The family called it loss.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, SUVs and sedans are the main cause. Trucks and buses follow. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt fewer, but the wounds are deep. Bikes are in the mix, but the numbers are small. The street is ruled by steel and speed.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher has pushed for change. She sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. &ldquo;We have the tools and the knowledge to prevent these tragedies from happening,&rdquo; she <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/brooklyn-crash-speed-limiters-reckless-drivers/>said</a>. State Senator Julia Salazar <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">voted yes</a> to curb repeat speeders. But the law is not yet passed. The dead do not wait for Albany.</p><p>Gallagher has also fought for safer streets on McGuinness Boulevard.

The op-ed, titled 'City plan for bike lanes on McGuinness Boulevard will overwhelm local roads,' argues that the plan, promoted by Restler and advocacy groups, would reroute thousands of vehicles onto residential streets. Restler’s opposition centers on concerns for local safety and access, stating, 'This tranquility will be disrupted when thousands of cars and trucks are rerouted onto these local streets.' Instead, the op-ed supports alternative safety measures such as speed cameras, curb extensions, and increased enforcement. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided for the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Protected bike lanes will come, but car lanes stay open during peak hours. The plan falls short of full safety measures. The road remains dangerous. Victims still count. No one is satisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, Mayor Adams announced a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious Brooklyn corridor. The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rider’s leg broke. Politicians and neighbors demand the mayor act. The city delays a safety plan. The street stays deadly. The call is clear: fix McGuinness now.</p><p class=mb3>On August 11, 2023, Council Member Lincoln Restler and other Northern Brooklyn officials responded to a crash on McGuinness Boulevard, where a driver hit and injured a moped rider. The incident happened near Meeker Avenue, one block from where teacher Matthew Jensen was killed in 2021. The matter, titled 'Locals call for mayor to take immediate action after moped rider injured on McGuinness Boulevard,' highlights the urgent need for the Department of Transportation’s proposed safety redesign. Restler, along with U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, and State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, issued a joint statement: 'Lives are being put at risk. We need immediate action by the Mayor's office to implement the Department of Transportation's proposed safety improvements so that everyone in our community can feel confident that McGuinness Boulevard will not cause more tragedies.' The safety plan remains blocked, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Comptroller Lander and Assemblymember Gallagher push back. They call for greenways, bike paths, and transit. Highway expansion repeats old mistakes. Vulnerable road users lose out. Safety and climate take a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On August 4, 2023, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher (District 50) joined Comptroller Brad Lander in criticizing New York State’s use of federal infrastructure funds. The state plans to spend hundreds of millions widening city highways, including $730 million for the Van Wyck Expressway. Lander called this a repeat of past errors, saying, 'Even maintaining a state of good repair on existing roadway infrastructure would be a better use of money than widening the highway.' Gallagher warned, 'New York state risks squandering the historic investments of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act by directing far too much funding toward highway expansion instead of climate resilient, multimodal projects.' Both urge a shift to projects that cut emissions and improve safety for all, especially those outside cars. The state DOT defends its plan, but advocates say vulnerable road users are left exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
