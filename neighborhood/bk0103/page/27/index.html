An e-bike slams into her in the bike lane on Bedford Avenue. She goes down hard. The rider stops. The girl is rushed to Bellevue with injuries to her stomach. She survives. The street does not forgive. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>Video shows the crash</a>.</p><p>A ten-year-old girl tries to cross Franklin Avenue with the light. An SUV turns left. She is crushed. She does not get up. The driver failed to yield. The city failed her first. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><p>A cyclist, 46, hits a parked SUV on Lynch Street.

The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. Cameras catch speeders and red-light runners. The city redesigns intersections. But the pace is slow. The pain is fast.</p><p><strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> But the limit stands. Leaders talk. Streets wait. The law is a tool left on the shelf. <a href=https://nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/2024/sammy-s-law>Passing Sammy’s Law was a critical first step in our effort to build safer streets… implementing reduced speed limits will be a simple yet powerful way to reduce traffic violence and protect our most vulnerable road users," said Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine.</a></p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-left-undone>What Next: The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong> The city has the power to slow the cars. It has the power to harden the crossings. It has the power to protect the child, the cyclist, the old man with a cane. It must use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the sidewalk.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, now before the City Council, aims to crack down on placard abuse by city workers, which Restler calls 'petty corruption.' The matter summary states the legislation would force agencies to revoke most placards not protected by union contracts. Restler also proposed a bill letting New Yorkers report illegal placards and collect a share of fines. Street safety advocates back the move, saying, 'Ending placard abuse in New York City will make our streets safe, while ensuring bus and bike riders can stay moving—unobstructed by illegally stored cars.' The bill follows years of failed enforcement and mounting placard numbers. Restler’s action targets a system that blocks crosswalks, endangers pedestrians, and slows public transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The redesign converts the street to one-way eastbound, adds a two-way protected bike lane, and installs pedestrian improvements like Qwick Curbs and refuge spaces. Loading zones and left-turn bans aim to cut injuries. Since 2015, 555 crashes have injured 124 and killed one pedestrian. Council Member Lincoln Restler backed the plan, calling it a 'top priority' and 'necessary response' to deadly conditions. Former Council Member Steve Levin and advocates pushed for these changes for years. Some locals criticized Qwick Curbs as ugly, but DOT officials stressed the board's advisory role. The redesign does not address Hoyt Street, where illegal parking remains rampant.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates like Brian Howald and Jon Orcutt stress the need for robust, physical protection—not just paint or flexible posts—to keep drivers out.

The plan, part of ongoing budget talks, aims to fund hundreds of miles of protected bike and bus lanes, plus concrete barriers. Council Member Lincoln Restler of District 33, a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, praised the move as 'a very clear commitment to addressing street safety across the five boroughs.' The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists. The Council had requested $3.1 billion, but Restler called the $900 million a dramatic investment. The budget must be finalized by June 30.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
