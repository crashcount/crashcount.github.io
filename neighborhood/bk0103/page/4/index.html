An e-bike slams into her in the bike lane on Bedford Avenue. She goes down hard. The rider stops. The girl is rushed to Bellevue with injuries to her stomach. She survives. The street does not forgive. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>Video shows the crash</a>.</p><p>A ten-year-old girl tries to cross Franklin Avenue with the light. An SUV turns left. She is crushed. She does not get up. The driver failed to yield. The city failed her first. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><p>A cyclist, 46, hits a parked SUV on Lynch Street.

The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. Cameras catch speeders and red-light runners. The city redesigns intersections. But the pace is slow. The pain is fast.</p><p><strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> But the limit stands. Leaders talk. Streets wait. The law is a tool left on the shelf. <a href=https://nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/2024/sammy-s-law>Passing Sammy’s Law was a critical first step in our effort to build safer streets… implementing reduced speed limits will be a simple yet powerful way to reduce traffic violence and protect our most vulnerable road users," said Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine.</a></p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-left-undone>What Next: The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong> The city has the power to slow the cars. It has the power to harden the crossings. It has the power to protect the child, the cyclist, the old man with a cane. It must use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the sidewalk.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT plans to cut speeds on 250 street segments this year, focusing on schools and shared streets. Research shows lower speed limits reduce injury severity in crashes.

The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, launched in fall 2023, uses sensors to detect overweight trucks and issue $650 fines. According to the city, 'Weigh-in-Motion technology has successfully eliminated 60% of the overweight truck traffic on the Queens bound BQE.' Restler said he hopes for similar results on the Staten Island-bound lanes. The bill authorizing the program is set to expire, prompting calls for urgent legislative action. Rodriguez called the technology a 'national model.' Lawmakers want to expand the system to other sites, including the Washington Bridge. The crackdown aims to reduce illegal truck loads, which threaten road safety and infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler said, "Weigh-in-Motion technology has successfully eliminated 60% of the overweight truck traffic on the Queens bound BQE."
