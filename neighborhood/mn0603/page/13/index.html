Ten seriously hurt.</strong> In Murray Hill-Kips Bay, the numbers do not flinch. Since 2022, 829 people have been injured in crashes. Ten of them suffered wounds that will not heal right—crushed legs, broken skulls, blood on the street. One never got up again. She was 77, crossing with the light at Lexington and East 29th. An SUV turned left. She died there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-do-the-damage>The Machines That Do the Damage</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs strike most often.</strong> Trucks, taxis, bikes, mopeds—they all leave marks. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans killed one and seriously injured another. Trucks and buses left one more with life-changing wounds. Bikes and mopeds hurt six. The street does not care who you are. It only matters what hits you, and how hard.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-the-gap>Leadership: Words, Laws, and the Gap</h3><p><strong>The city says it wants zero deaths.</strong> The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. The police promise to be visible. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done it here. The gap between law and street is wide.</p><p><strong>Cyclists are ticketed for following the law.</strong> The NYPD writes red-light tickets to riders who cross with the walk signal, even though a 2019 law allows it. &ldquo;It’s ridiculous that cyclists are being ticketed for riding legally, safely, and defensively,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/bicyclist-files-class-action-suit-against-nypd-over-red-light-summonses-AC4589266>said Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives</a>. The city, the lawsuit says, keeps ticketing anyway. &ldquo;This policy and practice is so consistent and widespread that it constitutes a custom or usage of which policymakers must have been aware,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/13/us-news/cyclist-sues-nypd-alleging-cops-wrongfully-dole-out-red-light-tickets-malicious-and-outrageous/>the suit claims</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The blood dries, but the danger stays.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit. It can fix the streets. It can stop blaming those who walk and ride. It can train police to follow the law. But it will not act unless you force it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just words.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The plan, echoing a 2010 First Avenue project, repurposes 23 feet for cyclists and bus riders between E. 59th and E. 96th streets. Council Member Keith Powers and Borough President Mark Levine endorsed the proposal, with Levine stating, 'The redesign’s commitment to expanded protected bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes will turn this particularly dangerous stretch of the roadway into a safer, more efficient, and forward-thinking artery.' Still, Levine and advocates like Anna Melendez (Transportation Alternatives) pressed for more: wider sidewalks, hardened pedestrian islands, and real physical protection. The plan uses only paint and plastic, leaving pedestrians exposed. The proposal faces a full board vote on October 19, 2022.

The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.'

The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016.

Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition.

The piece, titled 'Basement apartments shouldn’t be death traps,' criticizes government inaction after deadly floods from Hurricane Ida and Sandy. Kavanagh, a sponsor of recent state legislation, writes: 'New York City needs to immediately move to legalize and regulate basement apartments to ensure the safety of their tens of thousands of tenants.' He condemns defunded pilot programs and failed bills, calling for a full-scale mobilization to prevent more deaths.
