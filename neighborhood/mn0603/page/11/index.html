Ten seriously hurt.</strong> In Murray Hill-Kips Bay, the numbers do not flinch. Since 2022, 829 people have been injured in crashes. Ten of them suffered wounds that will not heal right—crushed legs, broken skulls, blood on the street. One never got up again. She was 77, crossing with the light at Lexington and East 29th. An SUV turned left. She died there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-do-the-damage>The Machines That Do the Damage</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs strike most often.</strong> Trucks, taxis, bikes, mopeds—they all leave marks. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans killed one and seriously injured another. Trucks and buses left one more with life-changing wounds. Bikes and mopeds hurt six. The street does not care who you are. It only matters what hits you, and how hard.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-the-gap>Leadership: Words, Laws, and the Gap</h3><p><strong>The city says it wants zero deaths.</strong> The mayor calls traffic violence a crime.

The board called on the Department of Motor Vehicles to impose civil penalties on unregistered dealers and urged city and state officials to enforce laws against selling non-street-legal mopeds. The resolution also asks the city to consider a buy-back program for gas-powered mopeds. The matter, titled 'Upper West Side Panel Backs Resolution to Rein in Dangerous Mopeds,' supports Albany legislation requiring sellers to register mopeds with the DMV before sale. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores sponsor the bill. Bores said, 'We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets.' The board’s move aims to close loopholes, protect vulnerable road users, and address the chaos caused by unregistered mopeds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It reduces the waiting period after community board notification from 90 days plus 45 after a hearing, to just 14 days. The matter summary reads: 'The City Council repealed a decade-old law that imposed lengthy delays on the city before it could break ground on new bike lanes.' Restler said, 'No other transportation project in New York City...requires this type of extended dead period.' Council Member Keith Powers backed the bill, citing rising cyclist deaths. The Department of Transportation called bike lanes 'life-saving infrastructure.' The amended bill now covers all bike lanes, regardless of length.

The DOT’s first plan would have cut traffic lanes and added a parking-protected bike lane. Adams ordered a weaker version after business pushback. The compromise left two car lanes in each direction during the day. Elected officials—U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and Council Member Lincoln Restler—sent a letter urging DOT to restore the full safety plan, writing, “Nothing has been done to improve conditions for pedestrians.” Advocates say the new design increases crossing distances and leaves cyclists and pedestrians exposed. DOT says work will continue into 2024. The boulevard remains dangerous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers, including State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez (District 59), call for strict regulation of emissions from last-mile e-commerce warehouses. The bill would require environmental reviews for warehouses over 50,000 square feet, mandate plans to cut air pollution, and push for zero-emission delivery vehicles. Gonzalez said, 'The unchecked growth of large warehouses in neighborhoods across NYC has worsened air quality, noise pollution, and traffic safety for everyday New Yorkers.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, a co-sponsor, highlighted the link between warehouse traffic, pollution, and traffic violence. The Red Hook Business Alliance and community advocates back the bill, citing heavy truck traffic, poor air, and threats to safety in working-class neighborhoods. The legislation aims to hold warehouse operators accountable and protect residents from the mounting toll of delivery-driven pollution and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council passed laws banning uncertified lithium-ion batteries and launched a trade-in program for unsafe batteries. The matter, titled 'NYC e-bike owners wonder where to store them as landlords fear battery fires,' highlights the tension: 'We're going to get into the business of getting the dangerous equipment off the street and set up a fund to do that,' Powers said. Advocacy groups, including Danny Harris, called for expanded safe bike parking and charging, stressing that e-bikes are a lifeline for many New Yorkers. The crackdown has led to stricter landlord policies, increased enforcement, and declining bike shop sales. The Council aims to improve safety without cutting off access for vulnerable road users who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to block illegal, unregistered mopeds from city streets. Dealers, not riders, would handle paperwork. Advocates say this targets bad actors and protects pedestrians from rogue machines.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2023, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan) introduced a bill in Albany to require moped dealers to register vehicles with the DMV before buyers leave the shop. The bill, supported by Assembly Member Alex Bores (D-Upper East Side), seeks to close a loophole that lets illegal mopeds flood city streets. The matter summary states: 'New legislation in Albany seeks to eliminate the use of illegal mopeds by requiring sellers to register them with the DMV before buyers can take them out of the shop.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This common-sense bill would simply ensure that the registration happens at the point of sale, before someone rides out of the shop.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project backs the move, stressing manufacturer responsibility. Attorney Daniel Flanzig says the law could clear streets of unregistered, dangerous vehicles. The bill is not yet law, but enforcement actions against illegal mopeds are already underway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
