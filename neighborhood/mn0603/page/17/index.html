Ten seriously hurt.</strong> In Murray Hill-Kips Bay, the numbers do not flinch. Since 2022, 829 people have been injured in crashes. Ten of them suffered wounds that will not heal right—crushed legs, broken skulls, blood on the street. One never got up again. She was 77, crossing with the light at Lexington and East 29th. An SUV turned left. She died there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-do-the-damage>The Machines That Do the Damage</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs strike most often.</strong> Trucks, taxis, bikes, mopeds—they all leave marks. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans killed one and seriously injured another. Trucks and buses left one more with life-changing wounds. Bikes and mopeds hurt six. The street does not care who you are. It only matters what hits you, and how hard.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-the-gap>Leadership: Words, Laws, and the Gap</h3><p><strong>The city says it wants zero deaths.</strong> The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. The police promise to be visible. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done it here. The gap between law and street is wide.</p><p><strong>Cyclists are ticketed for following the law.</strong> The NYPD writes red-light tickets to riders who cross with the walk signal, even though a 2019 law allows it. &ldquo;It’s ridiculous that cyclists are being ticketed for riding legally, safely, and defensively,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/bicyclist-files-class-action-suit-against-nypd-over-red-light-summonses-AC4589266>said Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives</a>. The city, the lawsuit says, keeps ticketing anyway. &ldquo;This policy and practice is so consistent and widespread that it constitutes a custom or usage of which policymakers must have been aware,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/13/us-news/cyclist-sues-nypd-alleging-cops-wrongfully-dole-out-red-light-tickets-malicious-and-outrageous/>the suit claims</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The blood dries, but the danger stays.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit. It can fix the streets. It can stop blaming those who walk and ride. It can train police to follow the law. But it will not act unless you force it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just words.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, discussed by the Department of Transportation and supported by then-Council Member Ben Kallos, faced strong resistance from Rep. Carolyn Maloney and Madeline Cuomo, sister of former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Maloney relayed school security concerns to Community Board 8, citing local opposition. Cuomo lobbied city officials directly. The matter summary states, 'The lack of bike infrastructure is linked to the recent death of cyclist Carling Mott.' Despite Maloney's later claims of general support for protected bike lanes, her intervention helped kill this project. Current Council Member Keith Powers has shown interest in revisiting the plan. The DOT is reviewing the fatal crash and street design.

Their letter cites 429 injuries and four pedestrian deaths along Broadway between August 2011 and May 2022. The officials wrote, 'This stretch of Broadway needs to be made safer, and we believe pedestrianization, with limited necessary entries for vehicles that must access certain points along Broadway, could be a way to positively transform the area and benefit all New Yorkers.' Business leaders, including Dan Biederman of the 34th Street Partnership, now support the plan, calling it good for economic development. The push follows a recent taxi crash at Broadway and 29th Street that injured six. The city’s Broadway Vision plan promises to pedestrianize much of the corridor from Union Square to Columbus Circle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal urges the Department of Transportation to close Broadway to most vehicles between 14th and 34th Streets next year, with future expansion to 42nd Street. The matter follows a severe June 20 crash where a taxi hit a cyclist. The politicians’ letter states: 'A safer, more pedestrian-friendly corridor must be achieved quickly.' Powers, along with Mark Levine, Carlina Rivera, and Erik Bottcher, argue the city’s current plan—limited to small plazas and traffic restrictions—is not enough.

The bill required the Department of Transportation, with the NYPD and other agencies, to conduct an annual study of dangerous driving behaviors linked to crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring a study of dangerous driving.' Council Members Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (primary sponsor), Keith Powers, Gale A. Brewer, Rita C. Joseph, Sandy Nurse, Shekar Krishnan, Lincoln Restler, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Marjorie Velázquez, and the Brooklyn and Manhattan Borough Presidents sponsored the bill. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023.
