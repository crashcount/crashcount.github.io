The driver was unlicensed, the car had Pennsylvania plates. That was Friday afternoon, Jan. 21, 2022. The city logged it as a failure to yield at the signal, and a death at the corner <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>per crash records</a>.</li><li>A 49-year-old man at 3rd Avenue and East 28th.

Since 2022, this neighborhood has recorded <strong>3 deaths and 969 injuries</strong> in 1,658 crashes. Pedestrians hurt: 224. Cyclists hurt: 225. Buses and trucks are overrepresented in pedestrian harm: one pedestrian killed by a bus; trucks and buses caused 18 pedestrian injuries; SUVs and cars killed one pedestrian and injured many more. These are the city’s counts for Murray Hill–Kips Bay through Aug. 24, 2025 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</p><p>Speed is the shadow you can’t see in the numbers marked “other.” It still shows. Night hours stack injuries. The worst spikes hit 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., with 73 and 58 injuries recorded across the period. Dawn and late afternoon also hurt: 5 a.m. and 4 p.m. each saw a death in this dataset. These hours, these corners, the pattern holds <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>.</p><p>“Demand for curb space is increasing,” DOT said as it moved curb rules on the Upper West Side.

She carries it <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>.</li></ul><p>The fixes are not poetry. They are paint, posts, and time.</p><ul><li>Daylight every corner. No parking to the crosswalk. Harden left turns on Lex and 3rd.

The event, covered on September 18, 2023, drew over 200 residents and was organized by Western Queens elected officials. The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal. No formal bill number or committee was cited; the event focused on immediate community engagement and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gaps in moped regulation remain.</p><p class=mb3>On September 16, 2023, Local Law 39 takes effect in New York City. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) will start enforcing the ban on uncertified lithium-ion battery sales. Inspectors will also check for illegal mopeds, issuing summonses and referring cases to NYPD and FDNY. DCWP spokesperson Michael Lanza said, 'While inspecting retailers for compliance with LL39, we will also check for illegal motorized scooters [mopeds], issue summonses and refer issues to NYPD and FDNY as appropriate.' Two days earlier, the City Council passed Council Member Keith Powers's bill for a citywide battery buyback program, letting delivery workers swap faulty batteries for certified ones. Powers acknowledged the ongoing problem of illegal mopeds, stating, 'We recognize that problem. We've been talking to the deputy mayor's office about further measures ahead.' The new law targets fire risk and unregulated vehicles, but loopholes in moped sales and enforcement persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The main bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, creates a city-funded buy-back program for delivery workers to exchange faulty batteries and devices for safe, certified ones. The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Tech giants profit. City infrastructure lags. Cars and trucks kill most. Enforcement is scattershot. Officials call for safe lanes, charging stations, and real accountability. The crisis demands a fix beyond punishing workers.</p><p class=mb3>"We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets." -- Alex Bores</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, published August 23, 2023, analyzes New York City’s 'moped crisis.' The article, reviewed by Streetsblog NYC, highlights systemic failures: unsafe streets, lack of charging infrastructure, and tech companies shifting risk onto underpaid delivery workers. Council Member Alexa Aviles urges rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and blames corporate greed. State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle. The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.' Advocacy groups reject punitive crackdowns on workers, pushing instead for expanded bike lanes and public infrastructure. The piece concludes that only a multi-pronged, structural approach—never just enforcement—will protect vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Protected bike lanes will come, but car lanes stay open during peak hours. The plan falls short of full safety measures. The road remains dangerous. Victims still count. No one is satisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, Mayor Adams announced a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious Brooklyn corridor. The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They argue EVs cut smog, so drivers deserve a break. Critics warn this move keeps streets clogged. Fewer cars mean fewer crashes. The fight pits clean air against crowded roads.</p><p class=mb3>On July 31, 2023, a group of Manhattan elected officials—including Assembly Members Alex Bores, Eddie Gibbs, Deborah Glick, Harvey Epstein, Rebecca Seawright; State Senators Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Liz Krueger, Kristen Gonzalez; and Borough President Mark Levine—sent a letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. They urged a congestion pricing discount for electric vehicles, claiming EVs 'do not contribute significantly to the smog and pollution of the Central Business District.' Assembly Member Bores led the effort, stating, 'when it comes to the environmental case, an electric vehicle is just a different profile than a gas-guzzling one.' The officials oppose credits for bridge and tunnel crossings. Congestion pricing advocates and environmental groups counter that EV discounts undermine the core goal: fewer cars, less traffic, safer streets. They note other cities are ending such breaks. The proposal highlights a tension—cleaner air versus safer, less crowded roads for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
