Same ending.</p><ul><li>A 77-year-old woman in the crosswalk at Lexington and East 29th. The SUV driver turning left didn’t yield. She died. The driver was unlicensed, the car had Pennsylvania plates. That was Friday afternoon, Jan. 21, 2022. The city logged it as a failure to yield at the signal, and a death at the corner <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>per crash records</a>.</li><li>A 49-year-old man at 3rd Avenue and East 28th. An MTA bus going straight struck him in the intersection before dawn on June 16, 2025. He died where people cross to work, to home, to the hospital a few blocks away <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>per the city dataset</a>.</li><li>A motorcyclist on the FDR at 3:48 a.m., July 24, 2025. Ejected. “Apparent death,” the record says. Right front impact. Distraction cited. The line is cold in the city file, but a person is gone <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>same source</a>.</li></ul><p>The bodies keep coming. Since 2022, this neighborhood has recorded <strong>3 deaths and 969 injuries</strong> in 1,658 crashes. Pedestrians hurt: 224. Cyclists hurt: 225. Buses and trucks are overrepresented in pedestrian harm: one pedestrian killed by a bus; trucks and buses caused 18 pedestrian injuries; SUVs and cars killed one pedestrian and injured many more. These are the city’s counts for Murray Hill–Kips Bay through Aug. 24, 2025 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</p><p>Speed is the shadow you can’t see in the numbers marked “other.” It still shows. Night hours stack injuries. The worst spikes hit 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., with 73 and 58 injuries recorded across the period. Dawn and late afternoon also hurt: 5 a.m. and 4 p.m. each saw a death in this dataset. These hours, these corners, the pattern holds <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>.</p><p>“Demand for curb space is increasing,” DOT said as it moved curb rules on the Upper West Side. More trucks. More loading. More conflict if the street stays the same <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/new-digital-parking-system-on-the-uws-implemented-in-dead-of-night-DG4954621>West Side Spirit</a>.</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li><strong>FDR Drive</strong> is the top hotspot here, with 121 injuries and two serious injuries. One person died here. High speed meets human bodies in breakdown lanes and on ramps. The tally is not a headline. It is a list of names no one prints <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city hotspot data</a>.</li><li><strong>East 34th Street</strong> logs 58 injuries and a serious injury. Hospital traffic. Ferries. Taxis. People walking to appointments they won’t keep if a driver looks down for a second <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>same source</a>.</li><li><strong>Lexington Avenue</strong> shows 22 injuries and a serious injury. At East 37th, a 61-year-old woman crossing with the signal suffered a head wound from the right front of a pickup’s bumper on May 16, 2025. She lived. She carries it <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>.</li></ul><p>The fixes are not poetry. They are paint, posts, and time.</p><ul><li>Daylight every corner. No parking to the crosswalk. Harden left turns on Lex and 3rd. Give walkers a head start at the light.</li><li>Keep heavy vehicles out of the mixing zone. Protected intersections where trucks turn. Freight loading off the travel lane on East 34th.</li><li>Night focus. Crashes spike after dark. Target the hours that bleed.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>After two people were killed by a driver going more than 100 mph at Canal and Bowery, DOT said it is “taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long-term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor.” Advocates answered: “the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly” without full redesign <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>On 31st Street in Astoria, as a lawsuit tried to stop bike protection, DOT said, “We stand firmly behind this project and will defend our work in court.” Electeds backed the redesign to “protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/dot-stands-by-astoria-safety-project-despite-foes-anti-bike-lawsuit>Streetsblog</a> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>earlier coverage</a>). The city can move fast when it wants to.</p><p>Slow the cars. Stop the killers.</p><p>Albany gave New York the tool to lower speeds. The city can set <strong>20 mph</strong> on local streets and save lives. It has not done it citywide. The power is there. The clock runs <a href=../../take_action/>our call to act</a>.</p><p>Repeat speeders do oversized harm. State lawmakers advanced the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045/A2299)</strong> to force habitual violators to install speed limiters. Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes in committee in June. Assembly Member Harvey Epstein co-sponsors the Assembly bill. The bill targets drivers who pile up points or camera tickets with devices that cap speed <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Assembly file</a>, <a href=../../take_action/>our brief</a>.</p><p>Streets here tell you what to do.

Cars pay to cross south of 60th. Lawmakers split. Some call it a burden. Others hail cleaner air, safer streets, and better transit. The toll stirs anger, hope, and a fight over who pays and who breathes.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2025, congestion pricing (no bill number cited) will begin in Manhattan after a federal judge allowed the toll to proceed. The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation. The case raises questions about police pursuit tactics and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, debated on December 12, 2024, sits before the City Council. It would require all e-mobility devices not covered by the state DMV to register with the city’s Department of Transportation. The bill’s summary states it aims to increase accountability for e-bike riders after fatal crashes. Holden, the sponsor, cited dangers from unregulated e-vehicles and hit-and-runs. Advocacy groups, including Los Deliveristas Unidos and Open Plans, argue the bill would unfairly criminalize immigrants and delivery workers, and increase police stops for people of color. The NYC Hospitality Alliance warns of new financial and administrative burdens for small businesses. Both sides agree cars cause far more deaths, but the bill’s critics say better street design, not registration, would protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is under council review as of December 10, 2024. The measure seeks to overhaul regulations that force NYCHA to keep up over 400 sidewalk sheds—spanning 25 miles—often long after repairs finish. The matter summary states, 'reforming parts of the city’s broader shedding regulations that are a poor fit for NYCHA and a nuisance citywide.' Powers and co-sponsor Erik Bottcher aim to reduce shed length, extend inspection cycles, and allow more art and color on scaffolds. Jamie Rubin, NYCHA board head, supports the bill, noting that current rules rob residents of sunlight, safety, and outdoor space. The bill promises to remove unnecessary sheds, reclaim millions in wasted funds, and improve daily life for public housing residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
