Ten seriously hurt.</strong> In Murray Hill-Kips Bay, the numbers do not flinch. Since 2022, 829 people have been injured in crashes. Ten of them suffered wounds that will not heal right—crushed legs, broken skulls, blood on the street. One never got up again. She was 77, crossing with the light at Lexington and East 29th. An SUV turned left. She died there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-do-the-damage>The Machines That Do the Damage</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs strike most often.</strong> Trucks, taxis, bikes, mopeds—they all leave marks. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans killed one and seriously injured another. Trucks and buses left one more with life-changing wounds. Bikes and mopeds hurt six. The street does not care who you are. It only matters what hits you, and how hard.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-the-gap>Leadership: Words, Laws, and the Gap</h3><p><strong>The city says it wants zero deaths.</strong> The mayor calls traffic violence a crime.

The bill, sponsored by Oswald Feliz, Marjorie Velázquez, and Lincoln Restler, amends laws to ban selling counterfeit tags, with fines starting at $1,000 for first offenses and $2,000 for repeat violations. The measure was brought before the City Council and discussed at a City Hall press conference. The matter summary states the bill 'goes after the unscrupulous used car dealers profiting considerably off a huge black market for phony tags.' Restler, as a sponsor, joins efforts to curb the spread of ghost cars, which evade speed cameras and tolls, making streets more dangerous for everyone. Lawmakers stress that the goal is deterrence, not revenue, and call for further action from online marketplaces and federal agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort comes as New York City faces a surge in deadly fires caused by uncertified lithium-ion batteries used by delivery workers. The initiative, supported by Mayor Adams and Council Member Keith Powers, aims to get safer, certified batteries into the hands of low-income delivery workers. Powers introduced legislation for a citywide buy-back program, stressing, 'we have to make sure that alongside shutting down the market for unsafe batteries, we remember that there are people affected by this.' Uber will also donate $100,000 to the FDNY Foundation for e-bike safety education. The city’s recent plan to combat battery fires highlights the need for private companies to take responsibility.

Brooks-Powers said, 'New Yorkers deserve access to high-quality services and investments in infrastructure citywide.' Council Member Keith Powers called the battery swap program a 'down payment.'

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens.

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.

The bill compels agencies to consider complete street design—meaning streets built for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users, not just drivers. It also requires the department to publish guidance and reference materials for public use. This measure, if enforced, could reshape how New York builds and rebuilds its roads, putting vulnerable road users at the center of every project.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Delays must be explained to neighbors. Streets torn up for months endanger walkers and riders. The bill died at session’s end. The danger remains. The clock keeps ticking.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0905-2023 was introduced on February 2, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to amend city law to require the Department of Transportation to finish all street resurfacing work within two weeks. If more time was needed, the department would have to notify the community, stating the reason and new timeline. The matter summary reads: 'ensure that all work associated with the resurfacing of any street is finalized within 2 weeks from the start of work.' Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by thirty other members. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst reviewed the impact, but torn-up streets are a known threat to pedestrians and cyclists. The bill is dead. The hazard lives on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
