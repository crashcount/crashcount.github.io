Ten seriously hurt.</strong> In Murray Hill-Kips Bay, the numbers do not flinch. Since 2022, 829 people have been injured in crashes. Ten of them suffered wounds that will not heal right—crushed legs, broken skulls, blood on the street. One never got up again. She was 77, crossing with the light at Lexington and East 29th. An SUV turned left. She died there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-do-the-damage>The Machines That Do the Damage</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs strike most often.</strong> Trucks, taxis, bikes, mopeds—they all leave marks. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans killed one and seriously injured another. Trucks and buses left one more with life-changing wounds. Bikes and mopeds hurt six. The street does not care who you are. It only matters what hits you, and how hard.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-the-gap>Leadership: Words, Laws, and the Gap</h3><p><strong>The city says it wants zero deaths.</strong> The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. The police promise to be visible. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done it here. The gap between law and street is wide.</p><p><strong>Cyclists are ticketed for following the law.</strong> The NYPD writes red-light tickets to riders who cross with the walk signal, even though a 2019 law allows it. &ldquo;It’s ridiculous that cyclists are being ticketed for riding legally, safely, and defensively,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/bicyclist-files-class-action-suit-against-nypd-over-red-light-summonses-AC4589266>said Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives</a>. The city, the lawsuit says, keeps ticketing anyway. &ldquo;This policy and practice is so consistent and widespread that it constitutes a custom or usage of which policymakers must have been aware,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/13/us-news/cyclist-sues-nypd-alleging-cops-wrongfully-dole-out-red-light-tickets-malicious-and-outrageous/>the suit claims</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The blood dries, but the danger stays.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit. It can fix the streets. It can stop blaming those who walk and ride. It can train police to follow the law. But it will not act unless you force it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just words.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, not yet numbered or assigned to committee, follows Mayor Adams's push to address what he calls street 'chaos.' Powers said, 'Biking is a crucial tool to tackle the climate crisis... but we also must address the well-documented concerns about safety.' He proposes a $50 penalty for violations. Critics, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, call the measure 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' warning it escalates the city's 'misguided war on biking.' Safety analyst notes show the policy may discourage cycling, reducing mode shift from cars and undermining safety in numbers. Enforcement has historically targeted Black and brown cyclists, while drivers—responsible for most deaths—face lighter penalties.

The plan, to be presented to community boards, would restrict through car traffic between Third and Ninth avenues, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter aims to address congestion and slow bus speeds on the M34, where buses average five to seven miles per hour. Council Member Keith Powers, who rides the route daily, said, "If you dedicate a big chunk of a corridor to bus service, you will see strong results." Powers and community leaders support the move, citing the 14th Street busway’s success: a 24 percent speed boost and 30 percent ridership jump. The proposal follows years of planning and comes as congestion pricing looms. Some advocates remain wary, recalling Mayor Adams’s past delays and reduced busway hours. The city faces pressure to make the busway permanent and effective for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable users watch.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the Adams administration's move to open a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge. The event, not a council bill but a city action, drew sharp criticism from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who opposed removing a vehicle lane for pedestrians and cyclists. The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.' Still, the move restores space to those on foot and bike, challenging car dominance and federal resistance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article quotes Transportation Alternatives: “That 5-7 second head start can mean the difference between being hit by a turning car and being seen by a turning car.” Esparza says officers ignore the rule, issuing criminal summonses instead of traffic tickets.
