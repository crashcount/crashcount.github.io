A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at 7th Avenue and 44th Street, struck by a turning sedan. In three and a half years, four people killed in Sunset Park (Central).

The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But in Sunset Park (Central), the blood dries faster than the laws change.

The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who refuse to act. Call your council member.

Strict privacy rules would limit data collection and retention.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 1063-2023 was introduced on June 8, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill called for the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications to build a mobile app displaying all public electric vehicle charging stations in New York City. The app would show locations, voltage, charging level, connector types, e-bike compatibility, and real-time availability. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the creation of a mobile application that provides information about electric vehicle charging stations.' Council Member Keith Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Avilés, Cabán, Farías, Riley, Richardson Jordan, Ossé, Ung, Hanif, Restler, and Gutiérrez. The bill set strict privacy: no device data, no tracking, no forced consent.

The bill, which would grant New York City local control over its speed limits, remains stalled in the Assembly. The rally, led by Families for Safe Streets, called out lawmakers for refusing to bring the measure to a vote. Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry. The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in a council hearing, aims to address safety and environmental justice. The matter summary states DOT must redesign routes to reduce truck traffic in low-income communities of color, where trucks bring pollution, congestion, and road violence. DOT’s Eric Beaton admitted, 'The current situation is already problematic... We want fewer truck miles on our streets.' Aviles, at a City Hall rally, said, 'We must take action.' Advocates like StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure called for strict enforcement and a ban on 53-foot trailers. The Trucking Association of New York supports the redesign and daylighting. The bill responds to a deadly trend: trucks killed 42 people in 2022, with most injuries on truck routes.

Delivery workers’ safety and livelihoods hung in the balance. Lawmakers targeted sellers, not riders. The bills aimed to stop deadly fires without punishing those who rely on e-bikes to survive.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, the New York City Council advanced a package of lithium-ion battery safety bills. Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bills, not yet passed or assigned a committee, require the city to study truck and delivery traffic, explore street design changes to limit commercial vehicles in residential areas, and consider maritime shipping alternatives. The matter summary states: 'Pols and advocates are demanding that New York City crack down on last-mile distribution facilities, which are proliferating in low-income communities of color and bringing increased truck traffic, emissions, and dangerous streets.' Aviles, joined by other council members and community advocates, criticized the city’s inaction and highlighted the toll on neighborhoods: delayed traffic studies, rising fatalities, and environmental harm. The coalition calls for a special permit process and zoning reforms to protect vulnerable residents from truck-related danger and pollution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the council, seeks to amend zoning laws to require special permits for new facilities. The measure aims to stop warehouse clustering near schools, parks, and homes, and mandates studies on truck traffic and air quality. The proposal, described as a response to 'an epidemic of truck traffic,' targets companies like Amazon whose rapid delivery model floods streets with trucks. Avilés declared, 'This is environmental racism. Last-mile facilities follow the same pattern, dumping environmental burdens on low-income communities of color.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez joined, demanding companies 'be responsible, take our communities into account so that we can breathe cleaner air.' The Adams administration expressed concern about economic impacts but supports electrification and cargo bike incentives. The bill awaits committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
