An 82-year-old, dead on 60th Street, struck by a motorcycle. A 67-year-old cyclist, ejected and killed on 53rd Street. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at 7th Avenue and 44th Street, struck by a turning sedan. In three and a half years, four people killed in Sunset Park (Central). Four more left with serious injuries. Behind each number, a family waits for news that will not get better.

In the last year alone, 2 killed, 1 seriously hurt, 142 injured. The dead are old and young. The injured are mothers, fathers, children. The street does not care. The numbers do not stop.

They are the weapon in most deaths and injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds take lives too. Bikes leave bodies broken, but not dead. The risk is not shared. The risk is forced onto those outside the steel shell.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But in Sunset Park (Central), the blood dries faster than the laws change. No local leader has stepped forward to claim this crisis. No bold redesign. No surge of enforcement. The silence is loud. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who refuse to act. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city use the power it has.

The matter, described as a move to 'loosen vehicle idling regulations around schools,' would let drivers idle engines by narrowing the definition of 'adjacent'—allowing them to move just down the block or across the street to evade the one-minute rule. Council Member Alexa Avilés, who sponsored a bill to expand these protections, condemned DEP’s plan, stating it 'flies in the face' of efforts to protect children, especially those with asthma. Every public speaker opposed the change. Ernest Welde accused DEP of misleading the public, calling them the 'Department of Enabling Polluters.' DEP said it would consider feedback before finalizing the rule.

Councilmember Alexa Avilés, representing District 38 and Red Hook, sponsored the bill after years of local organizing.

The measure sits in committee.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0224-2024, now laid over in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, urges Albany to pass S.7587/A.7833—the 'Commercial E-Bike Licensing Act.' The resolution, introduced March 7, 2024, calls for 'the registration of bicycles with electric assist used for commercial purposes and creates liability for employers for certain violations.' Council Member James F. Gennaro leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gale A. Brewer, Christopher Marte, Alexa Avilés, Farah N. Louis, and Justin L. Brannan. The bill would require commercial e-bikes to be registered and display visible license information. Employers, not delivery workers, would be fined for violations like sidewalk riding. The council frames this as a way to identify dangerous vehicles and hold companies accountable, aiming to reduce injuries and deaths among pedestrians and cyclists. The measure remains under committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
