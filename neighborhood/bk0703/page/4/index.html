An 82-year-old, dead on 60th Street, struck by a motorcycle. A 67-year-old cyclist, ejected and killed on 53rd Street. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at 7th Avenue and 44th Street, struck by a turning sedan. In three and a half years, four people killed in Sunset Park (Central). Four more left with serious injuries. Behind each number, a family waits for news that will not get better.

In the last year alone, 2 killed, 1 seriously hurt, 142 injured. The dead are old and young. The injured are mothers, fathers, children. The street does not care. The numbers do not stop.

They are the weapon in most deaths and injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds take lives too. Bikes leave bodies broken, but not dead. The risk is not shared. The risk is forced onto those outside the steel shell.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But in Sunset Park (Central), the blood dries faster than the laws change. No local leader has stepped forward to claim this crisis. No bold redesign. No surge of enforcement. The silence is loud. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who refuse to act. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city use the power it has.

Advocates demand equal pay and protection.</p><p class=mb3>On December 4, 2024, Council Members Jennifer Gutiérrez and Sandy Nurse introduced bills to the City Council’s Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection. The bills aim to close a loophole that lets grocery delivery apps like Instacart avoid paying the $20 per hour minimum wage required for restaurant deliveristas. The matter title: 'Council Seeks To Expand Minimum Wage to Grocery Deliveristas.' The hearing is scheduled for December 9. Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the Immigration Committee, called for broader protections: 'When you become a worker, you should be ensured a living wage.' Ligia Guallpa of Worker’s Justice Project said all delivery workers face significant risks and deserve safety, dignity, and respect. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection supports expanding the wage standard. Instacart opposes the bill. The Council’s action centers gig workers who ride city streets, exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.

Riley leads as primary sponsor, joined by Nantasha M. Williams, Darlene Mealy, Sandy Nurse, and others. The bill was referred to committee the day it was introduced. No safety analyst has yet assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the measure aims to keep large trucks from blocking curbs and crosswalks, where they threaten pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers. Streets belong to people again.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now Local Law 98 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 26, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Alexa Avilés sponsored the bill, citing freight traffic’s toll on her district. The law’s summary: DOT must report on redesign, using over 2,000 public comments. Many comments—36 percent—flagged dangerous conflicts between trucks, pedestrians, and cyclists. DOT missed the deadline, blaming an extended comment period. Elizabeth Yeampierre (UPROSE) demanded fewer trucks on residential streets and routes away from schools and parks. Maria Fernanda Pulido-Velosa (El Puente) called for real engagement and clear communication if delays continue. DOT now promises more outreach and a microhubs pilot for last-mile deliveries. But the overdue report leaves vulnerable road users exposed to daily risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
