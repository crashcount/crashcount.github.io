An 82-year-old, dead on 60th Street, struck by a motorcycle. A 67-year-old cyclist, ejected and killed on 53rd Street. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at 7th Avenue and 44th Street, struck by a turning sedan. In three and a half years, four people killed in Sunset Park (Central). Four more left with serious injuries. Behind each number, a family waits for news that will not get better.

In the last year alone, 2 killed, 1 seriously hurt, 142 injured. The dead are old and young. The injured are mothers, fathers, children. The street does not care. The numbers do not stop.

They are the weapon in most deaths and injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds take lives too. Bikes leave bodies broken, but not dead. The risk is not shared. The risk is forced onto those outside the steel shell.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But in Sunset Park (Central), the blood dries faster than the laws change. No local leader has stepped forward to claim this crisis. No bold redesign. No surge of enforcement. The silence is loud. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who refuse to act. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city use the power it has.

Council Member Susan Zhuang (District 43) was arrested and charged with assault during a protest against a Gravesend homeless shelter, highlighting fierce local opposition. The city’s new ban on vendors along the Brooklyn Bridge walkway took effect in January, aiming to reduce sidewalk congestion and improve pedestrian safety. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway’s long-awaited renovation faces further delays, with major construction not expected until 2029; short-term fixes are planned. The MTA upgraded the G train’s signal system, promising better service. Flatbush Avenue may see new bus lanes to speed up transit. The article quotes City Hall calling the bridge vendor ban a 'public safety issue due to the sprawling stalls taking up sidewalk space and causing congestion for pedestrians.'
