The report states the e-scooter rider suffered crush injuries to his arm but remained awake and conscious at the scene. The SUV, registered in New York and operated by a licensed driver from New Jersey, was described as 'starting from parking' at the time of the crash. The point of impact was the left front quarter panel of the SUV and the center front end of the e-scooter. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The narrative underscores the moment of impact: 'metal met flesh and the silence held.' No driver errors are explicitly cited, but the sequence of events highlights the systemic danger when vehicles pull from the curb into active traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash happened at a dangerous intersection. Advocates and Council Member Alexa Avilés demand urgent safety upgrades. The city has failed to protect riders. Death stalks the unprotected.</p><p class=mb3>On May 23, 2024, Council Member Alexa Avilés (District 38) joined advocates in demanding action after a cyclist was killed by a pickup truck driver at Fourth Avenue and 53rd Street in Sunset Park. The incident follows years of warnings about the corridor’s dangers. The matter, titled 'Locals demand action on Fourth Avenue bike lane after cyclist killed by pickup truck driver in Sunset Park,' highlights calls from Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets for protected bike lanes and intersection improvements. Avilés noted the victim may have been a delivery worker. Advocates blame city inaction for repeated deaths and urge Mayor Adams to finish long-promised safety upgrades.

The pledge came in a letter from Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer to Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, just before the Council’s Land-Use Committee reviewed the City of Yes for Economic Opportunity zoning change. The city promised to pass legislation within a year to control warehouse emissions and restrict new facilities in low-income areas without review. Council Member Alexa Avilés and activists have long demanded these protections, citing environmental harm and truck traffic. Torres-Springer wrote, 'The city shares the Council's desire to take near-term steps to address the harmful effects of last-mile operations.' The new rules will empower the Department of Environmental Preservation and propose zoning changes, though they are not part of the current zoning plan due to procedural limits. Advocates hope these steps will curb pollution and truck danger in vulnerable communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, described as a 'modern maritime port and mixed-use community hub,' aims to overhaul the industrial waterfront with new housing and shipping facilities. Council Member Alexa Avilés, representing District 38, serves as vice chair of the Brooklyn Marine Terminal Taskforce, leading community engagement. The plan includes an $80 million city investment and a $15 million state investment in cold storage to reduce truck traffic. Rep. Jerry Nadler criticized the move, warning that shrinking the Red Hook Container Port could increase truck traffic and harm jobs. The final vision will be shaped by community input.

The matter, described as a move to 'loosen vehicle idling regulations around schools,' would let drivers idle engines by narrowing the definition of 'adjacent'—allowing them to move just down the block or across the street to evade the one-minute rule. Council Member Alexa Avilés, who sponsored a bill to expand these protections, condemned DEP’s plan, stating it 'flies in the face' of efforts to protect children, especially those with asthma. Every public speaker opposed the change. Ernest Welde accused DEP of misleading the public, calling them the 'Department of Enabling Polluters.' DEP said it would consider feedback before finalizing the rule. The proposal remains under review, with no support from the public or council.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, known as the 'Our Water, Our Air Act,' also mandates traffic mitigation plans to reduce congestion, noise, and pollution near terminals, especially in Red Hook and Hell’s Kitchen. Councilmember Alexa Avilés, representing District 38 and Red Hook, sponsored the bill after years of local organizing. She said, 'The health and wellness of my community members are first and foremost.' The bill alters city contracts to enforce shore power use and directs the Economic Development Corporation to expand infrastructure. Local business owner Susan Povich called it 'the first step to address traffic and emissions.' The measure aims to cut deadly air and street hazards for neighborhoods long battered by cruise traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would require commercial e-bikes to be registered and display visible license information. Employers, not delivery workers, would be fined for violations like sidewalk riding.
