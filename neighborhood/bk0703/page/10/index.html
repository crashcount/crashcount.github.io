An 82-year-old, dead on 60th Street, struck by a motorcycle. A 67-year-old cyclist, ejected and killed on 53rd Street. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at 7th Avenue and 44th Street, struck by a turning sedan. In three and a half years, four people killed in Sunset Park (Central). Four more left with serious injuries. Behind each number, a family waits for news that will not get better.

In the last year alone, 2 killed, 1 seriously hurt, 142 injured. The dead are old and young. The injured are mothers, fathers, children. The street does not care. The numbers do not stop.

They are the weapon in most deaths and injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds take lives too. Bikes leave bodies broken, but not dead. The risk is not shared. The risk is forced onto those outside the steel shell.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But in Sunset Park (Central), the blood dries faster than the laws change. No local leader has stepped forward to claim this crisis. No bold redesign. No surge of enforcement. The silence is loud. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who refuse to act. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city use the power it has.

The bills, not yet passed or assigned a committee, require the city to study truck and delivery traffic, explore street design changes to limit commercial vehicles in residential areas, and consider maritime shipping alternatives. The matter summary states: 'Pols and advocates are demanding that New York City crack down on last-mile distribution facilities, which are proliferating in low-income communities of color and bringing increased truck traffic, emissions, and dangerous streets.' Aviles, joined by other council members and community advocates, criticized the city’s inaction and highlighted the toll on neighborhoods: delayed traffic studies, rising fatalities, and environmental harm. The coalition calls for a special permit process and zoning reforms to protect vulnerable residents from truck-related danger and pollution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the council, seeks to amend zoning laws to require special permits for new facilities. The measure aims to stop warehouse clustering near schools, parks, and homes, and mandates studies on truck traffic and air quality. The proposal, described as a response to 'an epidemic of truck traffic,' targets companies like Amazon whose rapid delivery model floods streets with trucks. Avilés declared, 'This is environmental racism. Last-mile facilities follow the same pattern, dumping environmental burdens on low-income communities of color.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez joined, demanding companies 'be responsible, take our communities into account so that we can breathe cleaner air.' The Adams administration expressed concern about economic impacts but supports electrification and cargo bike incentives.

The DOT’s proposal, which included one-way conversions, protected bike lanes, and expanded sidewalks, stalled after business opposition and a lawsuit. Following a crash that injured two young girls, DOT revived the plan but removed the Eighth Avenue bike lane. Aviles criticized DOT’s outreach, saying, 'the city could do better' and called for 'robust, accessible community engagement,' especially for Chinese-speaking residents. She urged DOT to finish promised safety work, prioritize pedestrian safety over business interests, and not rush the process. Aviles supported curb extensions, traffic calming, and one-way conversions if paired with real safety measures. She demanded urgent, compassionate action to protect vulnerable road users and insisted that community voices—not business parking—must guide street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The mayor returned it unsigned.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0291-2022, now Local Law 115 of 2022, was enacted by the City Council on November 27, 2022. The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
