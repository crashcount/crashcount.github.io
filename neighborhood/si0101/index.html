No one died in a crash here in the last year. But 71 people were hurt. Two were seriously injured. The wounds linger in bodies and families. In three years, 219 have been injured on these streets. The youngest was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandparent.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. In the last year, sedans alone injured seven pedestrians. No bikes killed or seriously hurt anyone. The street is not safe for the slow or the small.</p><h3 id=crashes-keep-coming>Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The news does not stop. In March, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a closed restaurant while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. Both went to the hospital. Hours earlier, a Dodge Charger spun out, hit a sanitation car, and then pinned a police officer. The chaos was plain. “It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>said witness Abi Aguirre</a>. The sound of metal and fear filled the street. “The sound of the car, when he was doing circles it was pretty, pretty heavy,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>Aguirre said</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say one life lost is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. Sammy’s Law lets the city set 20 mph limits, but most streets remain unchanged. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The city calls for Albany to act, but the clock ticks. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every injury is a choice made by leaders who delay. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more safe crossings, more action. Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.'

The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use.

The matter centers on whether car access improves safety after a recent attempted rape.

On Staten Island, officers responding to a gun call swerved to avoid a U-turning car, lost control, and crashed into a shuttered restaurant. Both officers were hospitalized with minor injuries. Hours earlier in Manhattan, a Dodge Charger changed lanes, clipped a street sweeper, spun out, and pinned an officer against his patrol SUV. Surveillance footage showed the Charger 'spinning out of control before hitting the officer.' Witness Abi Aguirre described the chaos: 'It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car.'

The matter title states: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation that would require the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide free express bus fare to New York City students who take express buses to and from school.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers is the primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Justin L. Brannan, Shahana K. Hanif, Kamillah Hanks, and Tiffany Cabán.

The vehicle, a 2022 Honda sedan, sustained center front-end damage. The driver was the sole occupant and was wearing a lap belt. She suffered an injury to her elbow, lower arm, and hand, classified as injury severity level 3, and was incoherent at the scene. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor, explicitly pointing to driver error. No other contributing factors or victim behaviors were noted. The driver was not ejected from the vehicle and did not report visible complaints. This crash highlights the dangers of driver distraction leading to self-injury in single-vehicle collisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The collision was a rear-end impact, with the striking vehicle hitting the center back end of the leading sedan. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor to the crash. A 34-year-old female occupant seated in the right rear passenger position of the struck vehicle sustained a back injury classified as severity level 3. She was conscious, not ejected, and restrained with a lap belt and harness. Both drivers were licensed and operating their vehicles straight ahead at the time of impact. The evidence points to driver error in maintaining attention, leading to the collision and injury to the passenger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill narrows the zone. Streets near schools lose protection. Sponsor Charles Fall backs the change. Kids and walkers face more risk.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A 4371, now at the sponsorship stage, sits before the New York State Assembly. The bill, sponsored by Charles Fall (District 61), was introduced on February 4, 2025. It is titled: 'Relates to photo speed violation monitoring systems in school speed zones in the city of New York.' The measure 'reduces the radial distance from school buildings for such school speed zones.' This means fewer streets near schools will be covered by speed cameras. Fall’s sponsorship signals support for shrinking the protected area. No votes have been recorded yet. The bill’s change strips away a layer of safety for children and other vulnerable road users who walk near schools. No safety analyst has weighed in, but the intent is clear: less camera coverage, more danger at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
