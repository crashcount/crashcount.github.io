No one died in a crash here in the last year. But 71 people were hurt. Two were seriously injured. The wounds linger in bodies and families. In three years, 219 have been injured on these streets. The youngest was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandparent.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. In the last year, sedans alone injured seven pedestrians. No bikes killed or seriously hurt anyone. The street is not safe for the slow or the small.</p><h3 id=crashes-keep-coming>Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The news does not stop. In March, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a closed restaurant while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. Both went to the hospital. Hours earlier, a Dodge Charger spun out, hit a sanitation car, and then pinned a police officer. The chaos was plain. “It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>said witness Abi Aguirre</a>. The sound of metal and fear filled the street. “The sound of the car, when he was doing circles it was pretty, pretty heavy,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>Aguirre said</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say one life lost is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. Sammy’s Law lets the city set 20 mph limits, but most streets remain unchanged. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The city calls for Albany to act, but the clock ticks. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every injury is a choice made by leaders who delay. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more safe crossings, more action. Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure, shaped by a Council law passed last year, forced all businesses to clear curbside setups by November 29. The Department of Transportation banned enclosed structures, allowing only temporary, open designs. As the city’s Dining Out NYC program shifts to seasonal operation, many owners, like John Kastanis of Casita and Jerry Hsu of Alimama Tea, chose to dismantle their sheds early, citing high fees and storage hurdles. Fred Kent, co-founder of the Placemaking Fund, lamented, “We’ve lost a whole era that could have been evolved into something far more significant for neighborhood main streets to thrive.” The curb returns to cars, erasing space once claimed by pedestrians and diners.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency now plans to study a tunnel under All Faiths Cemetery at Metropolitan Avenue. MTA President of Construction and Development Jamie Torres-Springer said, "We're looking at a tunnel at Metropolitan Avenue, which will allow us to avoid street running to make the [Interborough Express] faster and more reliable." Transit advocates, including Blair Lorenzo of the Effective Transit Alliance, praised the decision, calling it a win for speed and reliability. The MTA will assess expanding the existing freight tunnel or building a new one. The engineering and environmental review will take about two years. Funding for the IBX remains uncertain, as MTA CEO Janno Lieber warned that expansion projects could be at risk if the 2025-2029 capital plan falls short. The move removes a threat to vulnerable road users by keeping trains off city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable users wait.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Transportation’s Smart Curbs pilot, updated October 29, 2024, aims to convert free parking to paid meters and add delivery microhubs on the Upper West Side. The plan, first proposed in June, promised about 200 new metered spots and 27 loading zones, but only 175 free spaces—one-tenth of the area’s 1,700—will be removed. Microhubs, meant to reduce double-parking and delivery chaos, are delayed until next year. DOT spokespersons Vin Barone and Mona Bruno confirmed most changes are just reassignments, not true removals of free parking. Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS called the slow pace disappointing: “We’ve been super eager to see these changes, see what their impact is and start measuring and observing, so it’s a little disappointing.” Parking expert Donald Shoup urged the city to reinvest meter revenue locally, but DOT declined.

The project, covered in committee and public statements, is described as 'transformative for so many New Yorkers.' Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who represents the area, had threatened to oppose the IBX if it included street-running. After the MTA’s shift to tunneling, Holden stated, 'Addressing the biggest issue by forgoing light rail on 69th Street is crucial to earning our support.' The plan eliminates a dangerous section where trams would have mixed with cars, reducing exposure for pedestrians and cyclists. The MTA has issued a request for proposals to design the line and guide it through federal review. The $5.5 billion project’s funding remains uncertain, but the tunnel plan removes a major safety concern for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, not tied to a council bill but crucial for transit policy, states: 'The MTA can't take on any more debt to fill the hole...without dramatically jacking up fares or cutting service.' DiNapoli’s analysis shows that borrowing $15 billion now, plus $13 billion more for the next plan, would force a 16 percent fare hike by 2037. He notes the MTA’s finances are already strained by weak real estate taxes and slow ridership recovery. DiNapoli opposes fare hikes and service cuts, backing congestion pricing and state support instead. He stresses that without new, reliable revenue, vulnerable riders will pay the price. The warning is clear: more debt means danger for those who depend on transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, titled 'The Effects of 'Buy American': Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act,' analyzes the full societal costs of electric vehicles (EVs) versus gasoline vehicles (GVs). The study finds, 'U.S. electric vehicles are only slightly less harmful to the environment and society than conventional gasoline cars.' The analysis aggregates climate damage, crash deaths, and pollution. It reveals that EVs’ heavier weight leads to more fatal crashes, and their battery production is energy-intensive. Charging EVs on carbon-heavy grids causes six times more harmful pollution than gas tailpipes. The authors conclude that, factoring in all harms, EVs are only 10 percent less damaging than GVs. The report urges policymakers to reconsider subsidies and warns that the real-world toll of cars—electric or not—remains immense.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

But it still falls short. The MUTCD expects pedestrians and cyclists to act 'alertly and attentively,' ignoring human error and the diversity of street users. It keeps high barriers for pedestrian signals and prioritizes car movement over safety. The new section on autonomous vehicles raises concerns about streets being built for machines, not people.

The original lane reduction and protected bike lane plan, previously scrapped, will now move forward for the southern half of the street, between Calyer Street and Meeker Avenue. The matter, described as a return to 'the road diet it had previously finalized and then rejected,' follows months of community outcry and advocacy. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and other local officials celebrated the move, crediting the Make McGuinness Safe coalition for relentless pressure. Restler stated, 'this is a decision that enhances safety in our community, and that's what matters.' The northern half of the boulevard remains unchanged, with two traffic lanes and barrier-protected bike lanes.

The move slashed $15 billion from transit budgets, threatening repairs and upgrades. Hochul claimed to act for cost-of-living relief, but polling shows her approval at a record low. Republicans seized credit for the pause, while Democrats saw no political gain. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called it sabotage: 'Governor Kathy Hochul took a gamble when she sabotaged our public transit system for political gain and she lost dearly.' The MTA now faces a $33 billion shortfall for its next plan. No new revenue source is in place. The legislature, as Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany notes, already did its job by passing the law.
