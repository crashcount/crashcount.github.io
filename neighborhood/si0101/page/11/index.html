No one died in a crash here in the last year. But 71 people were hurt. Two were seriously injured. The wounds linger in bodies and families. In three years, 219 have been injured on these streets. The youngest was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandparent.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. In the last year, sedans alone injured seven pedestrians. No bikes killed or seriously hurt anyone. The street is not safe for the slow or the small.</p><h3 id=crashes-keep-coming>Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The news does not stop. In March, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a closed restaurant while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. Both went to the hospital. Hours earlier, a Dodge Charger spun out, hit a sanitation car, and then pinned a police officer. The chaos was plain. “It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>said witness Abi Aguirre</a>. The sound of metal and fear filled the street. “The sound of the car, when he was doing circles it was pretty, pretty heavy,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>Aguirre said</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say one life lost is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. Sammy’s Law lets the city set 20 mph limits, but most streets remain unchanged. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The city calls for Albany to act, but the clock ticks. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every injury is a choice made by leaders who delay. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more safe crossings, more action. Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He stated, 'The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.' Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, echoed his frustration, citing record cyclist deaths and urgent need for safety. The DOT has not responded to requests for comment.

In a closed-door meeting with the Department of Transportation, Adams said, "My legacy is not how many bike miles I do. My legacy is not how many bus lanes I do." He signaled a shift from measurable safety benchmarks to a focus on community input, a move DOT staffers called "extremely micromanaged." Adams’s administration has failed to meet even the minimum legal standards for new lanes. A mayoral spokesman claimed the city still delivers "safe, efficient streets," but advocates say Adams’s approach relies on vague metrics and lacks accountability. No council members are directly involved; this is a mayoral policy stance. The result: fewer protected spaces for vulnerable road users, more risk on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams’s comments came as he defended delays and rollbacks of approved street safety improvements, citing the need for more community input. Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Juan Restrepo (Transportation Alternatives) condemned the mayor’s approach, warning it gives veto power to small groups and leaves the city “rudderless” on street safety. DOT outreach has dropped to its lowest since Vision Zero began. The city is on pace to miss its bike and bus lane goals for the second year running.

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) leads the rollout. The plan covers about 41% of city housing. The official summary states, 'New Yorkers living in smaller residential buildings will have to set out their garbage in lidded bins.' DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended sidewalk placement, saying, 'It is standard practice around the world to put wheelie bins out on the sidewalk rather than in the parking lane.' Advocate Christine Berthet countered, 'While the bags will be easy to move between cars, containers will be much harder. And therefore having them in the parking lane would be a major benefit.' The city will retrofit trucks for the new bins. For now, pedestrians must still navigate bins on crowded sidewalks.

The policy, unveiled by DSNY, aims to move trash from sidewalks into closed bins, targeting cleaner streets and less sidewalk clutter. The mayor said, 'Everyday New Yorkers are tired of the rodents, they’re tired of the trash, and this is a small price to pay on ensuring that you can have cleaner streets.' Council member Shaun Abreu, representing West Harlem, voiced strong support, citing visible improvements from the local pilot. The plan requires smaller buildings to use wheeled bins on sidewalks, while larger buildings would get shared curbside containers. The city faces pushback from some residents, but Adams insists street cleanliness is a top concern.

The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy.

Danger stays.</p><p class=mb3>On September 13, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on the Department of Transportation’s progress toward mandated bus and bike lane construction. The hearing, led by Transportation Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for answers. The law requires 150 miles of protected bus lanes and 250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026. In 2022, the city built only 4.4 miles of bus lanes and 26.3 miles of bike lanes, far short of the legal benchmarks. Councilmember Lincoln Restler criticized political interference, saying, 'We're at a point where it's all politics all the time, and we're failing to execute.' Advocacy groups confirmed the city lags behind. The administration’s refusal to track or disclose progress leaves vulnerable road users exposed. The city’s failure to act keeps streets dangerous.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton and Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, refused to provide current figures, promising data next year. Brooks-Powers called this 'unacceptable.' She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency. Staffing shortages and council opposition to projects were cited as obstacles.

The author mapped safety features and hazards, proposing a new, proactive metric based on accessibility, comfort, and livability.
