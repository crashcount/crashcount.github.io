No one died in a crash here in the last year. But 71 people were hurt. Two were seriously injured. The wounds linger in bodies and families. In three years, 219 have been injured on these streets. The youngest was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandparent.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. In the last year, sedans alone injured seven pedestrians. No bikes killed or seriously hurt anyone. The street is not safe for the slow or the small.</p><h3 id=crashes-keep-coming>Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The news does not stop. In March, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a closed restaurant while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. Both went to the hospital. Hours earlier, a Dodge Charger spun out, hit a sanitation car, and then pinned a police officer. The chaos was plain. “It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>said witness Abi Aguirre</a>. The sound of metal and fear filled the street. “The sound of the car, when he was doing circles it was pretty, pretty heavy,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>Aguirre said</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say one life lost is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. Sammy’s Law lets the city set 20 mph limits, but most streets remain unchanged. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The city calls for Albany to act, but the clock ticks. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every injury is a choice made by leaders who delay. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more safe crossings, more action. Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

As a result, it's difficult to give Hizzoner a pass for falling short." -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2025, the Department of Transportation released its annual report on the 2019 Streets Master Plan law. The report, required by the City Council, reveals the city missed mandates for protected bike lanes (29.3 of 50 miles) and bus lanes (17.9 of 30 miles) for the third year running. The matter summary states: 'New York City has failed to meet legally required benchmarks for redesigning streets for bikes, buses, and pedestrians due to a lack of resources and political interference.' Mayor Eric Adams is named as the main obstacle. The report cites staff shortages, shrinking divisions, and political pushback—especially the mayor’s role in killing the Fordham Road busway. Former DOT commissioner Polly Trottenberg warned the plan needed more funding and a new approach. Advocates and officials say Adams’s lack of support left the city’s most vulnerable road users exposed. The law’s promise is broken. The streets stay deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders and advocates rage at more fees.</p><p class=mb3>On March 12, 2025, New York State lawmakers unveiled a budget proposal to fund the MTA’s 2025-2029 capital plan, which faces a $35 billion shortfall. The plan, discussed in both Senate and Assembly one-house budgets, suggests new taxes: fees on online deliveries, higher payroll mobility taxes, and more surcharges on rideshare trips. The matter summary reads: 'Taxes to back the MTA? That is what some New York lawmakers are proposing.' Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key figure. Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie previously rejected the MTA’s $68.4 billion plan last December over funding gaps. The proposal has sparked public anger, with advocates and riders decrying more taxes. MTA chair Janno Lieber insists full funding is essential to keep trains and buses running safely. The bill’s safety impact for vulnerable road users is not assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The change, reported by Streetsblog NYC, limits car-free hours to Saturdays only from May to September—a 50 percent cut from last year’s already reduced schedule. The program, once a weekend staple from spring to fall, now faces its smallest footprint yet. Alex Morano, a volunteer organizer, called the rollback 'really unfortunate,' stressing the street’s value to the neighborhood. Saskia Haegens, Chair of the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Corporation, urged full city funding, saying the program is 'transformative.' Organizers blame insufficient city support, with less than half the cost covered this year. The Department of Transportation claims $10 million in annual support and promises a permanent redesign, but for now, cars win back space.

Heidi Simon, a leading advocate, said, 'It's disheartening to know that there are people in the trenches at the local and state level who relied on these resources to get their jobs done, and their jobs just got made harder.'

Hochul faces pressure to let New York City charge for residential street parking. The plan targets illegal registrations, raises MTA funds, and could cut traffic. Critics say current rules reward fraud and endanger cyclists. Reform means fewer cars, safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 20, 2025, an editorial published by Streetsblog NYC called for Governor Hochul and state leaders to grant New York City the authority to create citywide, resident-only parking zones. The piece, titled 'Gov. Hochul Could Transform Our City with Parking Reform,' argues, 'With permission from the state, New York City could enact a citywide, resident-only parking system. Non-residents needn’t be banned from parking here, just charged for it, with the money going to the MTA.' The editorial highlights rampant illegal vehicle registrations and the dangers they pose, including uninsured cars and increased risk for cyclists. The proposal urges charging both residents and visitors for parking, with higher rates in dense, wealthy areas. The plan aims to reduce congestion, generate MTA revenue, and reclaim curb space for safer uses. No council member is directly named, as this is an opinion piece, but the call is clear: state action is needed to protect vulnerable road users and restore trust in public space management.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision was a rear-end impact, with the striking vehicle hitting the center back end of the leading sedan. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor to the crash. A 34-year-old female occupant seated in the right rear passenger position of the struck vehicle sustained a back injury classified as severity level 3. She was conscious, not ejected, and restrained with a lap belt and harness. Both drivers were licensed and operating their vehicles straight ahead at the time of impact. The evidence points to driver error in maintaining attention, leading to the collision and injury to the passenger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Tickets soared. Bus speeds rose. Crashes fell. Cameras now outpace NYPD enforcement. Repeat offenders dodge deterrence. Advocates push for tougher penalties. Streets clear, but danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On February 13, 2025, the MTA reported results from its Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) expansion, which began in August 2024. The program, described as 'bus-mounted camera tickets to drivers who double-park along bus routes or park in bus stops,' has issued over 400,000 tickets in five months. The ACE system grew from 623 buses on 14 routes to 1,000 buses on 34 routes by November. MTA spokesperson Laura Cala-Rauch said the program 'is having a big impact on speeding buses and improving the quality of life for New Yorkers.' Data from Jehiah Czebotar shows cameras now issue 76.4% of bus lane and stop tickets—93% by December. Bus speeds rose 5%, crashes involving buses dropped 20%, and emissions fell up to 10%. Persistent violators remain, with some drivers racking up five tickets. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called for escalating fines and legislative changes to target repeat offenders. The ACE program marks a shift toward automated, consistent enforcement, but loopholes for chronic blockers persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would cut the required minimum personal injury protection insurance for yellow cabs, liveries, and app-based drivers from $200,000 to $50,000. At a recent hearing, Lauren Pine, a nurse and crash survivor, testified: 'The minimum $50,000 no fault insurance was exhausted within the first week or so of my hospitalization.' Pine urged the Council to oppose the bill, warning that victims of traffic violence would be left financially devastated. Transportation Alternatives’ Ben Furnas also opposed the bill, stating, 'This legislation will ultimately make it more expensive and difficult to access care, treatment, and support after a traffic crash.' The bill is generating support among some council members, but advocates and survivors demand the Council maintain current coverage to protect crash victims.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The IBO states: 'It will be virtually impossible for the city to meet the City Council's required 150 miles of new bus lanes at the pace Mayor Adams is going.' Mayor Adams, who took office in 2022, has slowed or killed key bus projects, including the Fordham Road busway. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno claims the agency is building protected lanes and using cameras for enforcement, but admits resources are tight. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has called for compliance but not funded it. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein blames hiring freezes and political interference for 'broken promises and neglected legislation.' The report shows that while DOT’s budget grew, staffing for bus lane expansion fell. Bus speeds remain stuck at 8.1 mph.

The Council, after pressure from housing opponents, reinstated parking requirements in many transit-served neighborhoods, despite the City Planning Commission's push to eliminate them citywide. The matter, as described, states: 'Anyone not supporting the elimination of parking mandates is only perpetuating our city's housing crisis.' Planning expert Eric Kober, the author, argues the Council's move blocks housing growth and contradicts city policies to reduce car use. Council members' actions—passing a diluted version of COYHO—leave vulnerable road users exposed. The compromise preserves car dominance, keeps streets dangerous, and stalls progress for safer, people-first neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case is not a council bill, but a flashpoint in the debate over child independence and pedestrian safety. Prosecutor Emma Harper said the arrest was due to the boy walking on 'a busy highway with no sidewalk.' The matter highlights how parents, not road designers or drivers, face consequences when children navigate unsafe streets. Advocates, including Lenore Skenazy and attorney David DeLugas, condemned the criminalization of parents and called for accountability in road design. Streets like Mineral Bluff Highway, with high speeds and no sidewalks, endanger all pedestrians.
