No one died in a crash here in the last year. But 71 people were hurt. Two were seriously injured. The wounds linger in bodies and families. In three years, 219 have been injured on these streets. The youngest was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandparent.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. In the last year, sedans alone injured seven pedestrians. No bikes killed or seriously hurt anyone. The street is not safe for the slow or the small.</p><h3 id=crashes-keep-coming>Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The news does not stop. In March, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a closed restaurant while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. Both went to the hospital. Hours earlier, a Dodge Charger spun out, hit a sanitation car, and then pinned a police officer. The chaos was plain. “It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>said witness Abi Aguirre</a>. The sound of metal and fear filled the street. “The sound of the car, when he was doing circles it was pretty, pretty heavy,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>Aguirre said</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say one life lost is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. Sammy’s Law lets the city set 20 mph limits, but most streets remain unchanged. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The city calls for Albany to act, but the clock ticks. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every injury is a choice made by leaders who delay. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more safe crossings, more action. Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brooks-Powers stated, 'The Streets Plan is the law, and the Department of Transportation is still failing to fulfill its legal obligations.' She promised to hold DOT accountable at an upcoming budget hearing. The city also lagged on bus stop upgrades, completing just 54 out of 500 required.

The plan, discussed in workshops since spring 2023, would reduce the avenue from three to two moving lanes each way, add parking-protected bike lanes, and install painted pedestrian islands. Board members, including Katie Walsh and Gabino Morales, voiced strong support, with Morales stating, 'This is just a beginning of what we could do to fix our community.' Diana Gonzalez described the avenue as a place where 'they're gonna kill you.' The board will urge DOT to go beyond paint and install hard infrastructure.

The plan will close the current narrow walkway this fall and replace it with an eight-foot-wide path for cyclists and pedestrians by year’s end. The project is part of a broader push to make three MTA bridges accessible to non-drivers. MTA Construction and Development President Jamie Torres-Springer said, 'The MTA has made great progress in planned capital improvements to pedestrian and bike accessibility on bridges.' Local cyclist Allegra LeGrande called the move overdue, noting, 'If they build it they will come.' The project includes a cantilevered ramp for wheelchair access and improved exits. While the path is closed, a shuttle bus may run for six weeks.

Streets stay risky for those on foot or bike.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0099-2024, now laid over in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, would require the Department of Transportation to create curbside overnight parking for commercial vehicles in every Industrial Business Zone. The bill, introduced February 8, 2024, mandates that only commercial vehicles may park in these zones between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. The matter title states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the creation of curbside overnight truck parking sections in Industrial Business Zones.' Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), Nantasha M. Williams, Lincoln Restler, Farah N. Louis, Kevin C. Riley, and others back the measure. DOT must consult community boards and report annually on effectiveness. No safety analysis for vulnerable road users is available. The bill remains in committee, with no vote scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation.

The Department of Sanitation will install stationary curbside trash enclosures for buildings with 31 or more units in Manhattan Community Board 9 by spring 2025. The policy, championed by Mayor Adams, follows a pilot that cut rat sightings by 68 percent. Adams called the new side-loading truck 'the future of New York City garbage collection.' The plan replaces about 150,000 parking spots—five percent of the city’s total—with trash containers. Smaller buildings will use wheeled bins on sidewalks. Advocates support the move, urging shared containers to keep sidewalks clear. Some warn that too many bins could harm businesses and streetscapes.

He writes, 'The increasing size of passenger vehicles has been catastrophic for road safety, traffic congestion, climate viability, and household budgets.' Komanoff opposes SUV and pickup proliferation and supports downsizing, electrification, and policies like road pricing and better transit. He stresses that larger vehicles are far more likely to kill other road users. He argues that electrification and smaller cars alone cannot cut emissions or deaths enough. Only less driving, paired with systemic changes—congestion pricing, curb pricing, and livable streets—will protect the vulnerable and the climate.
