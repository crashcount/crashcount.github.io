Brown questioned new railcars for the borough after lawmakers opposed congestion pricing. Officials call his stance bureaucratic ignorance. The fight spotlights power struggles over transit and rider needs.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2024, seven Staten Island officials, including Council Minority Leader Joseph Borelli (District 51), called for the removal of MTA board member Norman Brown. Their letter to Governor Hochul followed Brown’s June comments suggesting Staten Island lose its promised 75 new R211S railcars because local lawmakers opposed congestion pricing. The letter, signed by Assemblymen Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Tannousis, Michael Reilly, Borough President Vito Fossella, State Senator Andrew Lanza, Councilman David Carr, and Borelli, called Brown’s remarks 'a masterclass in bureaucratic ignorance.' Brown said he would welcome removal. The new railcars would replace aging trains from the 1970s. The matter exposes deep rifts over transit funding and priorities, with Staten Island riders caught in the crossfire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They slammed the Governor’s pause on congestion pricing. The move guts $15 billion from transit upgrades. Projects for elevators and ramps stall. Disabled riders, seniors, and veterans lose out. Politicians split. Riders left stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the MTA Board heard public testimony and political debate on the fallout from Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing, which was set to begin June 30. The meeting focused on the loss of funding for transit accessibility. The matter, described as 'New Yorkers decry loss of congestion pricing money for accessible transit to MTA Board,' drew sharp criticism from disability advocates and riders. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, representing District 23, praised the Governor’s pause, calling congestion pricing 'the wrong plan for my constituents.' The pause leaves a $15 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, halting upgrades like elevators and ramps at dozens of stations. Advocates warned that without this funding, disabled New Yorkers, seniors, and veterans remain shut out of the subway. The MTA faces a federal mandate to make 95% of stations accessible by 2055, but these projects now stall. Riders demanded action. Politicians offered little hope.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
