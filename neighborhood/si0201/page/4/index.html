Six seriously injured.</strong> In three and a half years, the streets of Grasmere-Arrochar-South Beach-Dongan Hills have claimed lives and broken bodies. An 80-year-old man, crossing at Hylan and Benton, did not make it home. A 64-year-old woman, crushed by an SUV turning left on Mason Avenue, died before sunrise. A 30-year-old driver, chest crushed on Steuben Street, never got out of his car. Two elders, one 76, one 75, struck at intersections, left bleeding or broken. The numbers are small. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In this district, SUVs killed three people and seriously injured three more. Sedans left two with serious injuries. Trucks and buses added another. Not one cyclist or pedestrian killed another person.

They are on Hylan, Steuben, Mason. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not. Cameras catch speeders, but only where installed. The rest of the street is left to chance.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another chance for a family to lose someone. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras on every deadly stretch. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton (D-23) joined 17 other lawmakers in a lawsuit against the plan, which would charge drivers entering Midtown Manhattan. The editorial claims, 'solving [MTA fiscal problems] by punishing average New Yorkers simply for driving is insane,' and highlights concerns over economic burden. The piece quotes union leaders and lawmakers, including Scarcella-Spanton, City Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli, and US Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, all opposing the tolls. There is no assessment of the impact on vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, or transit riders. The focus remains on driver expenses and political backlash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passing on October 19, 2023, and became law on November 19, 2023. The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C. Riley (primary), with Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Hanif, Brewer, Restler, and Rivera as co-sponsors, the bill demands DOT report, by neighborhood, on safety infrastructure investment, crash rates, and demographics. It shines a light on which districts get safety upgrades and which are left exposed. The roadmap aims to close the gap for underserved areas, forcing transparency and accountability for every dollar spent on street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
