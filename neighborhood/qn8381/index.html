Kennedy International Airport: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 16, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-numbers-hide-the-hurt>The Numbers Hide the Hurt</h3><p>No one died at JFK Airport in the last three years. But the pain is there, quiet and steady. One hundred twenty-five people injured. Not a single month without a crash. No one walks away untouched. The numbers are cold, but the wounds are real.</p><p>Cars and trucks did the damage. Sedans, SUVs, trucks—each one a blunt instrument. Pedestrians hit, bones broken, lives changed. No bikes, no mopeds, just the heavy metal of everyday traffic. One driver, age 62, left with whiplash after a rear-end crash on Nassau Expressway. Another, age 40, concussed behind the wheel on the Van Wyck. These are not headlines. These are lives <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>buried in the data</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. State Senator James Sanders voted yes to curb repeat speeders, aiming to force the worst drivers to slow down with speed-limiting tech <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>in June 2025</a>. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson backed the extension of school speed zones <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>to protect children</a>. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers pushed for more daylight at intersections and a citywide greenway plan, calling it &ldquo;a real opportunity&mldr; to make a profound impact&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>on safe streets</a>.</p><p>But the danger remains. The Conduit, the main artery to JFK, is still a threat. Borough President Donovan Richards said it plain: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s confusing, it&rsquo;s poorly designed &mldr; and we know the lack of sufficient pedestrian and bike infrastructure makes it even more dangerous for the neighbors of Queens and Brooklyn&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/13/can-new-york-city-fix-its-deadly-conduit-to-jfk-airport>said Richards</a>.</p><h3 id=the-work-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Work Ahead: No More Waiting</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a failure of will. The fixes are known: slower speeds, clear sightlines, streets built for people, not just cars. The leaders have taken steps. But steps are not enough. The slow bleed continues.</p><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand more. Do not wait for the next crash. The numbers will not save you. Only action will.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city." The agency says it incorporated feedback from 90% of local businesses.
