Kennedy International Airport: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 27, 2025</h2><h3 id=broken-bodies-silent-roads>Broken Bodies, Silent Roads</h3><p>No one died here this year. But the numbers do not comfort. In the last twelve months, 34 people were hurt in 46 crashes on the roads around JFK. Not one serious injury, not one fatality. Still, the wounds add up: whiplash, concussions, broken arms, a knee torn open. The pain lingers long after the sirens fade.</p><p>The roads do not forgive. A 57-year-old man lost control of his SUV on the Belt Parkway and struck a tree. He died before help could arrive. Police said he &ldquo;failed to navigate the roadway and struck a tree&rdquo; <a href=https://qns.com/2025/04/brooklyn-motorist-killed-belt-parkway-ozone-park/>according to The Brooklyn Paper</a>. No arrests. No answers. Just another name lost to the highway.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city says it wants zero deaths. They point to new laws and safer designs. They say, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/queens-moped-rider-antonio-smith-ortiz-fatally-struck-wrong-way-hit-and-run-driver/>said Mayor Adams</a>. They passed Sammy’s Law. They can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit still stands at 25. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany stalls.</p><p>The work is not done. The city built new crosswalks, added bike lanes, and claimed progress. But the crashes keep coming. The pain keeps coming. The silence from leaders is louder than the traffic.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-action-or-more-names>What Comes Next: Action or More Names</h3><p>Every crash is a warning. Every injury is a call for change. The city has the power. The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. But nothing changes unless you demand it.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the laws they passed. Lower the speed. Keep the cameras.

The crash happened on North Channel Bridge near Cross Bay Boulevard. The driver stayed at the scene; police made no arrests or summonses. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program (DVAP) requires drivers with 15 speeding tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure, but enforcement is weak. Only a few hundred out of over 20,000 eligible drivers have complied. Queens Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the transportation committee, called for re-examining street safety and road design at the corridor, echoing residents’ demands for safer infrastructure. Advocates, including Families for Safe Streets, urged passage of Sammy’s Law to let NYC set its own speed limits. Brooks-Powers did not comment on the DVAP’s failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states: 'A long-stalled bill that would allow people to report drivers who block bike or bus lanes is about to move forward in the City Council, but without its central feature: people who make complaints will no longer receive 25 percent of the resulting ticket revenue.' Restler said, 'My top priority is expanding street safety.' The bill now requires a digital training course and valid ID for complainants. Only unoccupied cars can be reported.

They demanded daylighting, neckdowns, speed bumps, stop signs, and reflective markings at Newtown Road intersections. The lawmakers wrote, “Nothing can bring back Dolma Naadhun, but we can prevent further loss of life so that no family must experience the loss of a loved one.” DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed a Council bill mandating 100 daylighted intersections per year, arguing for flexibility and physical infrastructure in daylit spaces.
