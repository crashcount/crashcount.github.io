The dead are not just numbers. They are the old and the young. A 52-year-old man, a 61-year-old man, a 53-year-old woman, a 21-year-old rider. Most were walking. Most were hit by drivers going straight or turning. The street is wide. The crossings are long. The danger is routine.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new laws like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. But in Melrose, the speed stays high. The crossings stay wide. The cameras are not everywhere. The deaths keep coming.</p><p><strong>No local leader has stood at this corner and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</strong> No law has forced the street to change. The families wait. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-wait-for-the-next-name>Act Now—Or Wait for the Next Name</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real changes to crossings. Demand cameras that never go dark.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The street will not fix itself. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Multiple SUVs were involved, all initially parked or stopped, with damage noted on their left front bumpers and right rear quarter panel. The pedestrian was not in the roadway and was conscious after the collision. The report highlights the vehicle driver error of operating a vehicle with a defective accelerator, which led to the collision and injury. No pedestrian actions were cited as contributing factors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz stated, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz highlighted the broader issue: "We’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced."

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation. The case raises questions about police pursuit tactics and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
