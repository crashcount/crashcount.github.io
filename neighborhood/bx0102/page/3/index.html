Twelve left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, three more lives ended and three more bodies were broken. The numbers are steady. The pain does not fade.</p><p>In April, Inza Fofana, a hospital cleaner, crossed E. 149th Street after his shift. He was going to buy socks. A van turned left. He never made it home. &ldquo;He was going to buy socks. That&rsquo;s why he crossed the street,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/06/bronx-hospital-worker-buy-socks-van-driver-struck-him/>said his sister-in-law</a>. The driver stayed. No arrest. The street stayed the same.</p><p>Fofana&rsquo;s family stood at the corner and asked for what should be basic. &ldquo;There has to be a cross guard over there for the pedestrian to cross the street safely and for the loved one of everybody to get home with no problem, for something like Inza to never happen again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/06/bronx-hospital-worker-buy-socks-van-driver-struck-him/>said Nanssira Cisse</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-the-policy>The Pattern Is the Policy</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, vans, taxis, motorcycles.</strong> They all kill here. The dead are not just numbers. They are the old and the young. A 52-year-old man, a 61-year-old man, a 53-year-old woman, a 21-year-old rider. Most were walking. Most were hit by drivers going straight or turning. The street is wide. The crossings are long. The danger is routine.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new laws like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. But in Melrose, the speed stays high. The crossings stay wide. The cameras are not everywhere. The deaths keep coming.</p><p><strong>No local leader has stood at this corner and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</strong> No law has forced the street to change. The families wait. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-wait-for-the-next-name>Act Now—Or Wait for the Next Name</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real changes to crossings. Demand cameras that never go dark.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The street will not fix itself. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
