So does <a href=#>Melrose Avenue</a>. These are not one‑offs. They are patterns. The dataset lists them as top sites by injuries.</p><p>Dead is precise. So are the case files. On April 2, 2025, an SUV going straight on 149th hit a 52‑year‑old pedestrian midblock. He died. Three SUVs were involved. The record is <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4803347</a>. On June 25, 2024, a taxi on East 149th struck a 61‑year‑old man crossing without a signal. He died too. That is <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4735638</a>.

Narrow the lanes.</p><h3 id=the-wider-frame>The wider frame</h3><p>Speed is the lever. Citywide, the tools exist. Albany passed Sammy’s Law; the city can set lower limits. Advocates are pushing for a default 20 mph. Our own coverage lays it out and cites the numbers on repeat offenders. The state is also moving on speed limiters for the worst drivers. The Senate bill S 4045 advanced in June; local senators voted yes in committee. Those devices cap speed to the limit plus five for drivers with long violation records.</p><ul><li>The push to drop speeds and stop repeat speeders is detailed in our <a href=/take_action/>action guide</a>, including the data on how a small group of drivers cause outsized harm.</li><li>State bill S 4045 drew yes votes in committee from Senators in this area; see the file and vote records <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>here</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=voices-from-the-aftermath>Voices from the aftermath</h3><p>“Two people were killed. He was drunk,” said a sister after a Bronx parkway crash that took two young riders. She asked why he walked free. “How could they let him go?” The case is not in Melrose, but it is in the Bronx, and it is now. The names were Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. Police charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. The family’s words stand. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a> and <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> reported them.</p><p>This is not numbers.

They claimed community harm, ignoring hard data. Bike lanes and safer streets faced political fire. DOT stood firm, citing lives saved and broad support. Vulnerable road users caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on DOT street safety projects and Streets Plan implementation. The hearing, led by Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), Christopher Banks (D-Brooklyn), and Rafael Salamanca Jr. (D-Bronx), focused on the DOT's progress under the Streets Plan, which mandates annual targets for protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns. DOT officials defended their process, emphasizing community engagement and prioritizing high-need areas. The council's opposition stands in stark contrast to the projects' proven safety benefits for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bill pushes complete street design. Aim: safer roads for all. Pedestrians, cyclists, and riders get space. Car dominance challenged. Lawmakers move to cut street carnage.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 2714, titled 'Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles,' advanced through committee and passed several Senate votes, most recently on March 27, 2024. Sponsored by Timothy M. Kennedy with support from Jake Ashby, Jamaal Bailey, and others, the bill mandates street designs that protect everyone—not just drivers. The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The bill marks a shift away from car-first planning, forcing cities to build streets for people, not just traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
