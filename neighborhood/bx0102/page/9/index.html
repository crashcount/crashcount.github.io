Twelve left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, three more lives ended and three more bodies were broken. The numbers are steady. The pain does not fade.</p><p>In April, Inza Fofana, a hospital cleaner, crossed E. 149th Street after his shift. He was going to buy socks. A van turned left. He never made it home. &ldquo;He was going to buy socks. That&rsquo;s why he crossed the street,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/06/bronx-hospital-worker-buy-socks-van-driver-struck-him/>said his sister-in-law</a>. The driver stayed. No arrest. The street stayed the same.</p><p>Fofana&rsquo;s family stood at the corner and asked for what should be basic. &ldquo;There has to be a cross guard over there for the pedestrian to cross the street safely and for the loved one of everybody to get home with no problem, for something like Inza to never happen again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/06/bronx-hospital-worker-buy-socks-van-driver-struck-him/>said Nanssira Cisse</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-the-policy>The Pattern Is the Policy</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, vans, taxis, motorcycles.</strong> They all kill here. The dead are not just numbers. They are the old and the young. A 52-year-old man, a 61-year-old man, a 53-year-old woman, a 21-year-old rider. Most were walking. Most were hit by drivers going straight or turning. The street is wide. The crossings are long. The danger is routine.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new laws like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. But in Melrose, the speed stays high. The crossings stay wide. The cameras are not everywhere. The deaths keep coming.</p><p><strong>No local leader has stood at this corner and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</strong> No law has forced the street to change. The families wait. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-wait-for-the-next-name>Act Now—Or Wait for the Next Name</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real changes to crossings. Demand cameras that never go dark.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The street will not fix itself. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill required the Department of Sanitation and NYPD to tow vehicles that block streets or lack visible, valid license plates, registration, or inspection stickers. The matter summary reads: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code...in relation to towing vehicles that are an encumbrance on the street or that lack, improperly display, or obscure valid license plates, registration stickers, inspection stickers, or vehicle identification numbers.” Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Salamanca, Brannan, Feliz, Stevens, Ung, Riley, and Schulman. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action.

The bill, which would grant New York City local control over its speed limits, remains stalled in the Assembly. The rally, led by Families for Safe Streets, called out lawmakers for refusing to bring the measure to a vote. Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry. The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Oswald Feliz, Marjorie Velázquez, and Lincoln Restler, amends laws to ban selling counterfeit tags, with fines starting at $1,000 for first offenses and $2,000 for repeat violations. The measure was brought before the City Council and discussed at a City Hall press conference. The matter summary states the bill 'goes after the unscrupulous used car dealers profiting considerably off a huge black market for phony tags.' Restler, as a sponsor, joins efforts to curb the spread of ghost cars, which evade speed cameras and tolls, making streets more dangerous for everyone. Lawmakers stress that the goal is deterrence, not revenue, and call for further action from online marketplaces and federal agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
