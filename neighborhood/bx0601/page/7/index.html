Five left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In West Farms, from 2022 to June 2025, the street is a wound that never closes. <strong>SUVs took both lives.</strong> One man, one woman. One on Boston Road, one on East Tremont. The numbers are small if you don’t know the names. But every number is a family, a chair left empty, a future erased. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>.</p><p><strong>Nearly 500 injured.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, walkers. A 74-year-old woman crossing with the signal, struck by a bike. A 19-year-old thrown from his moped by a turning SUV. A cyclist ejected by an ambulance on Tremont. The stories pile up. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting-game>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting Game</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Sammy’s Law passed. The tools are there. But in West Farms, the speed stays the same. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they’re turned on. The city touts intersection redesigns and new bike lanes, but the blood on the street says it’s not enough. <strong>No new laws, no new protections, no bold moves from local leaders.</strong></p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the killing.</strong> Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they don’t kill. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, the old, the young—pay the price for delay. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the injuries. The city waits.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now? No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The power to save lives sits unused. The council, the mayor, the DOT—each can act. Each can lower the speed. Each can harden a crossing. Each can choose to protect you, or to wait for the next crash.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real protection.</strong> Don’t wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.
