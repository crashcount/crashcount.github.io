Five left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In West Farms, from 2022 to June 2025, the street is a wound that never closes. <strong>SUVs took both lives.</strong> One man, one woman. One on Boston Road, one on East Tremont. The numbers are small if you don’t know the names. But every number is a family, a chair left empty, a future erased. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>.</p><p><strong>Nearly 500 injured.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, walkers. A 74-year-old woman crossing with the signal, struck by a bike. A 19-year-old thrown from his moped by a turning SUV. A cyclist ejected by an ambulance on Tremont. The stories pile up. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting-game>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting Game</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Sammy’s Law passed. The tools are there. But in West Farms, the speed stays the same. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they’re turned on. The city touts intersection redesigns and new bike lanes, but the blood on the street says it’s not enough. <strong>No new laws, no new protections, no bold moves from local leaders.</strong></p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the killing.</strong> Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they don’t kill. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, the old, the young—pay the price for delay. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the injuries. The city waits.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now? No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The power to save lives sits unused. The council, the mayor, the DOT—each can act. Each can lower the speed. Each can harden a crossing. Each can choose to protect you, or to wait for the next crash.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit.

The article, titled 'A NIMBY City Hall: Adams Appointees Thwart Key Bike and Bus Projects,' details how the Mayor’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA) delays or blocks bus lanes, bike lanes, Citi Bike expansion, and pedestrianization. Appointees Tiffany Raspberry and Menashe Shapiro, both lacking transportation backgrounds, are named as obstacles. Council Members Francisco Moya, Bob Holden, and Oswald Feliz, all Adams allies, have influenced these delays. DOT officials describe a new layer of bureaucracy: 'The threshold for stopping any single project, it’s almost nonexistent.' Projects like Northern Boulevard bus lanes and Fordham Road improvements are on hold. DOT morale is low. The city’s promise of $904 million for street safety is undermined by political interference. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as progress stalls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In a letter to NYCHA CEO Greg Russ, Avilés urged targeted battery safety rules instead of a broad ban, warning, 'NYCHA's all-out ban could hurt workers and residents more.' She offered eight recommendations, including federal study, safe battery storage, and clear rules for mobility devices. Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz announced plans for legislation requiring certified batteries, while Manhattan’s Gale Brewer is drafting a ban on second-hand batteries and pushing for delivery app accountability. The matter is under review after the comment period closed September 6. NYCHA declined to comment. Avilés’s stance centers on protecting delivery workers and vulnerable residents while addressing real fire risks from faulty batteries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0501-2022 was introduced to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on June 2, 2022. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.
