Two men died. The driver fled. The city failed to stop him. A wedding became a funeral.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (2025-07-27), a 17-year-old allegedly drank at a Midtown club, then drove the wrong way on the Henry Hudson Parkway. He crashed head-on into Kirk Walker and Rob McLaurin, killing both. The teen, Jimmy Connors, fled, leaving his injured passenger. The article states, “Walker, 38, was one day from his wedding when he and McLaurin were killed.” An off-duty NYPD officer pursued Connors but did not call 911. The lawsuit names the driver, club, NYPD, and city, raising questions about underage drinking enforcement and police response. Connors faces charges including second-degree murder.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bottcher</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2025, Council Member Robert Holden and animal advocates rallied at City Hall, demanding passage of Ryder's Law to ban horse-drawn carriages in New York City. The bill, sponsored by Holden, has not yet reached a council vote or hearing. The rally followed a 'not guilty' verdict in a high-profile horse abuse case. The matter, described as a push 'to end the horse carriage industry in NYC,' drew support from NYCLASS and others. Holden blasted city oversight as 'inexcusable.' Despite the outcry, a safety analyst notes: ending horse carriages will not significantly improve safety for pedestrians or cyclists, since carriages are a small part of street traffic and their removal does not fix systemic road dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
