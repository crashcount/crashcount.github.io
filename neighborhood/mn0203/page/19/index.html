They call out broken promises and demand action. The MTA stalls. The neighborhood waits. Riders walk farther. Streets stay dangerous. The city delays. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2022, Council Member Erik Bottcher, Rep. Jerry Nadler, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, State Sen. Brad Hoylman, and Assembly Members Dick Gottfried and Linda Rosenthal rallied for the 7 train station at 41st Street and 10th Avenue. The station, once promised as part of the Hudson Yards rezoning, was cut to save money. Bottcher called the cut a 'huge mistake.' Hoylman said it was a 'bait and switch.' Nadler pledged to fight for federal funding. The MTA said it would study the project. The matter: 'Pols and advocates are calling on the MTA to finally build the promised 7 train station at 41st Street and 10th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen.' No formal bill number or committee was cited. The lack of a station keeps riders on foot longer, exposing them to traffic and danger. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, sponsored by Assemblymember Deborah Glick (District 66) and Senator Andrew Gounardes, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7 in up to 750 school zones. The bill was set to expire but now runs through July 1, 2025. The matter summary states: 'New York City is now able to operate its speed cameras 24 hours a day.' Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children. The bill passed just before the legislative session ended, closing a deadly loophole in city enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary: 'The city's school zone speed cameras will now operate 24/7 year-round.' Hochul cited student deaths and the need for constant protection. Mayor Adams called the program a national model, noting, '72 percent of fatalities have been happening when the cameras were off.' The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns.

Kessler, a candidate for Assembly District 66, calls out incumbent Deborah Glick for supporting speed-camera renewal but failing to reduce car dominance. He states, 'To get cars off the streets, we have to stop subsidizing their usage.' Kessler pledges to expand protected bike and bus lanes, end free curbside parking, and push for weight-based vehicle fees. He argues that current subsidies—free parking, gas-tax holidays, and slow-walked congestion pricing—endanger New Yorkers, especially those outside cars.

The bill extends the hours that speed cameras operate in New York City school zones. Primary sponsor: Senator Gounardes, with co-sponsors Biaggi, Cleare, Gianaris, Hoylman, Jackson, Kavanagh, Krueger, Myrie, Persaud, Ramos, Rivera, and Sepulveda. The measure saw strong support in both chambers, despite some opposition. The bill aims to keep cameras watching when children are at risk. More enforcement, more accountability.
