A car keeps going. Blood on the pavement, a head wound, a life changed. In the last twelve months, West Village saw 97 people injured and 3 seriously hurt in 220 crashes. No one was killed in that period, but four have died since 2022. Pedestrians, cyclists, drivers. No one is spared.</p><p>A uniformed officer walks to his car at dawn. A Dodge Charger, speeding, spins out after hitting a street sweeper. The officer tries to run. He does not make it. The car pins him to his own cruiser. Both men survive, but not unscathed. &ldquo;The driver of the Charger appeared to be speeding,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/14/nypd-officer-struck-and-pinned-by-out-of-control-dodge-charger-in-manhattan/>said a witness</a>. The officer is rushed to the hospital. The driver is taken into custody. Charges are pending. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/greenwich-village-officer-struck-cop-injured-control-dodge-charger-manhattan/16022235/>&ldquo;The officer was pinned between the Charger and a marked police vehicle,&rdquo;</a> police said.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Cars and trucks do the most harm. Since 2022, they killed two and seriously injured four. Bikes and mopeds hurt, too, but the numbers are smaller. The street does not care who you are. It takes children, the old, the young, the strong. In the last year, five people under 18 were injured. One was a child.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The mayor calls every death one too many. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. The council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. Each day they wait, the street claims another.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Tell Albany to keep the cameras on. Stand with those who have lost. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Change it. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers. Assembly Member Grace Lee said, 'They should be exempt from tolls under the congestion pricing plan.' The MTA has not taken a position on the exemption.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan faces legal and political hurdles but aims to reclaim space for people.</p><p class=mb3>On September 20, 2023, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine revived a proposal to remove the FDR Drive viaduct south of the Brooklyn Bridge. The plan, not yet in committee or assigned a bill number, seeks federal support through the Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods grant. Levine urges Mayor Adams to apply for funding, stating, 'We’re a perfect candidate for Reconnecting Communities.' State Senator Brian Kavanagh voiced support, saying, 'We will work with the borough president.' The proposal would transform the underused highway into a waterfront space for cyclists and pedestrians, echoing successful removals in cities like Seattle and Seoul. The project faces major legal, environmental, and jurisdictional obstacles, as the FDR is state-owned and exempt from congestion pricing. The city previously considered this removal for coastal resiliency, but dropped it from the final plan. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the plan centers vulnerable road users by reclaiming space from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure urges the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.1679/S.561, which would 'increase the penalty for leaving the scene of an accident involving an e-scooter and further calls upon the New York State Legislature to include e-bikes in such legislation.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Gale A. Brewer, Shaun Abreu, Lynn C. Schulman, and Amanda Farías backed the resolution. The bill would raise penalties for e-scooter hit-and-runs from a violation to a misdemeanor or felony, and seeks to add e-bikes to the law.

The article, reviewed by Streetsblog NYC, highlights systemic failures: unsafe streets, lack of charging infrastructure, and tech companies shifting risk onto underpaid delivery workers. Council Member Alexa Aviles urges rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and blames corporate greed. State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle. The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.' Advocacy groups reject punitive crackdowns on workers, pushing instead for expanded bike lanes and public infrastructure. The piece concludes that only a multi-pronged, structural approach—never just enforcement—will protect vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police claim safety, but data show cars and trucks cause most harm. App companies profit. Immigrant workers pay. Advocates say crackdowns punish the vulnerable, not the reckless. The city misses the real threat.</p><p class=mb3>On July 14, 2023, NYPD officers from Brooklyn’s 78th Precinct seized illegal mopeds from delivery workers outside fast-food chains. The enforcement action follows years of crackdowns dating back to Mayor Bloomberg, ramped up under Mayor de Blasio. Police say the seizures make streets safer, but city crash data show cars and trucks—not e-bikes or mopeds—cause most pedestrian injuries. Delivery worker Roziev Akmal warned, 'Livelihoods will be ruined because of the seizure.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called it 'another example where you see deliveristas being economically impacted.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman and Council Member Gale Brewer cited constituent complaints, but advocates and legal experts argue enforcement targets workers, not the root causes. The crackdown leaves low-paid, mostly immigrant workers exposed to fines, lost income, and road danger, while app companies escape responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Fewer cars, more space for people. The numbers demand it.</p><p class=mb3>""Hoylman-Sigal did say that banning privately owned e-bikes was 'going too far,' the paper reported, but he also did not focus the safety concerns on drivers and on the city's failure to widen sidewalks, create new micromobility lanes or daylight intersections."" -- Brad Hoylman-Sigal</p><p class=mb3>On June 30, 2023, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced a sweeping policy shift: the new 'Street Code.' The plan, described as giving 'absolute priority for pedestrians,' will remove 70,000 parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, widen sidewalks, and expand bike lanes. Hidalgo rejects harsh measures against e-bikes, focusing instead on reducing car dominance and discouraging SUVs through progressive parking fees. Council Member Gale A. Brewer, District 6, is mentioned in the context of New York’s contrasting approach, where enforcement often targets e-bikes rather than cars. Advocates highlight that cars and trucks cause most pedestrian injuries and deaths. They urge New York to emulate Paris—reclaiming street space from cars, not blaming micromobility. The data is clear: fewer cars mean safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
