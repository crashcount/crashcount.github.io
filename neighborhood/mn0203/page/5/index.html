A car keeps going. Blood on the pavement, a head wound, a life changed. In the last twelve months, West Village saw 97 people injured and 3 seriously hurt in 220 crashes. No one was killed in that period, but four have died since 2022. Pedestrians, cyclists, drivers. No one is spared.</p><p>A uniformed officer walks to his car at dawn. A Dodge Charger, speeding, spins out after hitting a street sweeper. The officer tries to run. He does not make it. The car pins him to his own cruiser. Both men survive, but not unscathed. &ldquo;The driver of the Charger appeared to be speeding,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/14/nypd-officer-struck-and-pinned-by-out-of-control-dodge-charger-in-manhattan/>said a witness</a>. The officer is rushed to the hospital. The driver is taken into custody. Charges are pending. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/greenwich-village-officer-struck-cop-injured-control-dodge-charger-manhattan/16022235/>&ldquo;The officer was pinned between the Charger and a marked police vehicle,&rdquo;</a> police said.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Cars and trucks do the most harm. Since 2022, they killed two and seriously injured four. Bikes and mopeds hurt, too, but the numbers are smaller. The street does not care who you are. It takes children, the old, the young, the strong. In the last year, five people under 18 were injured. One was a child.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The mayor calls every death one too many. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. The council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. Each day they wait, the street claims another.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Tell Albany to keep the cameras on. Stand with those who have lost. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Change it. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
