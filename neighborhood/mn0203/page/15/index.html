One was a child.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The mayor calls every death one too many.

Each day they wait, the street claims another.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit.

They need safe streets.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2022, Council Members Erik Bottcher, Rita Joseph, and Selvena Brooks-Powers introduced a resolution urging the Department of Education to teach bicycle safety in all New York City public schools. The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.' The council’s action highlights a gap between policy and real safety for children on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This pilot, part of the Clean Curbs program, is a joint effort by the Departments of Sanitation and Transportation, with support from Small Business Services and Council member Erik Bottcher. Bottcher, a Sanitation Committee member, said, “On-street containerized trash is an idea whose time has come in New York City.” The Alliance funded the $9,000 bins, aiming to clear sidewalks in one of the city’s busiest pedestrian zones. The program marks a shift in public-realm management, prioritizing pedestrian movement and sanitation in dense areas. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the move reclaims space from cars for people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The official matter: 'NYC pilot program launch: curbside trash enclosures (Clean Curbs) in Times Square.' Bottcher said, 'On-street containerized trash is an idea whose time has come in New York City.' The Alliance pays for the bins, aiming to clear sidewalks for 300,000 daily walkers. The move marks a shift: curb space goes to people, not cars.

Council Member Erik Bottcher pressed Strauber, citing resident complaints about fake placards and blocked curbs. Bottcher said, 'NYPD traffic enforcement agents are not issuing tickets to many people using counterfeit placards.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the lack of a digital placard system and is drafting new enforcement legislation. Local Law 6 mandates weekly sweeps and monthly reports, but agencies have failed to comply. The Adams administration has not advanced citizen enforcement.

The bill would have stopped cars from carrying giant ads through city streets. Sponsors wanted to codify an existing rule. The session ended. The bill died. The danger rolls on.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0075-2022 was introduced on March 10, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to ban moving billboards, echoing the matter title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to banning moving billboards.' Council Members Gale A. Brewer (primary), Justin L. Brannan, Erik D. Bottcher, Kalman Yeger, and Lincoln Restler sponsored the measure. The bill sought to codify an existing city rule (34 RCNY 4-12(j)), making it illegal to operate, stand, or park vehicles for commercial advertising. Violators would face a $500 penalty. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
