Since 2022, they killed two and seriously injured four. Bikes and mopeds hurt, too, but the numbers are smaller. The street does not care who you are. It takes children, the old, the young, the strong. In the last year, five people under 18 were injured. One was a child.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The mayor calls every death one too many. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. The council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. Each day they wait, the street claims another.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit.

The 46-year-old man suffered severe facial lacerations and remained conscious at the scene. No mention is made of any pedestrian error or behavior contributing to the crash. The bus sustained no damage, and the driver continued without stopping, underscoring the lethal consequences of driver distraction in New York City’s dense streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority.

The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible."

Safety reclaimed.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2024, city officials and civic leaders marked the completion of Plaza33, a pedestrian plaza on 33rd Street by Penn Station. The event capped years of transformation, turning a block once 'full of cars and trucks' into a car-free space. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, Assembly Member Tony Simone, and Council Member Erik Bottcher attended the ribbon-cutting. Levine recalled, 'I remember the battle over transforming this space and all the people who said that it would clog up traffic all over Midtown if we turned this street over to people and here we are and it's gorgeous.' Vornado Realty Trust funded the $65-million project with the Department of Transportation. The plaza, now permanent, offers 16,000 square feet for pedestrians, with trees, seating, and public programming. The change removes cars from a busy Midtown block, giving vulnerable road users safe, open ground.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver’s unsafe backing left no chance for survival.</p><p class=mb3>A 35-year-old man was killed on Cornelia Street in the early morning when a garbage truck, traveling south, backed unsafely and struck him with its right rear bumper. According to the police report, the truck’s wheels crushed the pedestrian’s skull, causing fatal injuries at the scene. The report explicitly lists 'Backing Unsafely' as the contributing factor for the crash. The victim was not at an intersection and was described as performing 'Other Actions in Roadway,' but the report does not cite any pedestrian behavior as a cause. The focus remains on the driver’s action: reversing a large refuse vehicle without adequate care, as documented by police. This crash underscores the lethal consequences when heavy vehicles back unsafely on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Riders face twenty blocks of chaos—no protection, just trucks and speeding cars. Bottcher calls it danger. DOT promises action but offers no date. The city lags on its own bike lane goals.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2024, Councilmember Erik Bottcher and five other Manhattan officials called on the Department of Transportation to close the protected bike lane gap on Sixth Avenue. Their letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez urges the city to connect the missing stretch between Canal Street and West 8th Street, a span where cyclists must ride in open traffic. The letter states, 'The Department of Transportation should prioritize a new bike lane at this location, which has been a long standing request of the community.' Bottcher, representing District 3, said, 'You know you're going to be in danger, because you're going to have to be riding in the same lane as speeding traffic, cars and trucks.' DOT spokesperson Nick Benson acknowledged support for the expansion but gave no timeline. The city has installed only 1.1 miles of protected bike lanes this year, far behind the 50-mile annual target in the NYC Safety Street Plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian sustained facial injuries with minor bleeding and was reported to be in shock. The report cites the cyclist's unsafe speed and failure to yield right-of-way as contributing factors to the crash. The bicycle showed no damage, indicating a direct impact to the pedestrian rather than a collision with another vehicle. The pedestrian's actions or safety equipment were not listed as contributing factors.
