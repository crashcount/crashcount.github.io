Since 2022, they killed two and seriously injured four. Bikes and mopeds hurt, too, but the numbers are smaller. The street does not care who you are. It takes children, the old, the young, the strong. In the last year, five people under 18 were injured. One was a child.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The mayor calls every death one too many. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. The council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. Each day they wait, the street claims another.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Tell Albany to keep the cameras on. Stand with those who have lost. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.

The proposal urges the Department of Transportation to close Broadway to most vehicles between 14th and 34th Streets next year, with future expansion to 42nd Street. The matter follows a severe June 20 crash where a taxi hit a cyclist. The politicians’ letter states: 'A safer, more pedestrian-friendly corridor must be achieved quickly.' Powers, along with Mark Levine, Carlina Rivera, and Erik Bottcher, argue the city’s current plan—limited to small plazas and traffic restrictions—is not enough. They demand bold action to protect pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s response: their plans already include many changes, but the council members say it falls short.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation will install several dozen rat-proof trash bins for building managers and superintendents to store garbage and recycling, moving bags off sidewalks and into curbside street lanes. The matter summary reads: 'Testing a rat-proof trash container... instead of on the sidewalk.' Council Member Erik Bottcher said he is 'thrilled that our district was the first to be chosen for this exciting advance,' calling it 'another important step.' The pilot takes parking space for bins, sparking complaints from drivers but clearing pedestrian paths. The city plans to expand the $1.3-million program to all five boroughs. Critics note the bins are small and collection methods unchanged, limiting scale. Still, the move marks a shift: less sidewalk trash, more space for people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, sponsored by Assemblymember Deborah Glick (District 66) and Senator Andrew Gounardes, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7 in up to 750 school zones. The bill was set to expire but now runs through July 1, 2025. The matter summary states: 'New York City is now able to operate its speed cameras 24 hours a day.' Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children. The bill passed just before the legislative session ended, closing a deadly loophole in city enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Assembly Member Deborah Glick and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, was passed after statistics showed rising crashes and injuries near schools. The matter summary: 'The city's school zone speed cameras will now operate 24/7 year-round.' Hochul cited student deaths and the need for constant protection. Mayor Adams called the program a national model, noting, '72 percent of fatalities have been happening when the cameras were off.' The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns. Glick and Gounardes pledged to push for stronger measures. A separate bill to expand red light cameras failed. The new law closes deadly loopholes but leaves enforcement gaps for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement, titled 'New York Must Stop Subsidizing Car Usage,' highlights a 44 percent rise in traffic fatalities and criticizes the city’s car-centric policies. Kessler, a candidate for Assembly District 66, calls out incumbent Deborah Glick for supporting speed-camera renewal but failing to reduce car dominance. He states, 'To get cars off the streets, we have to stop subsidizing their usage.' Kessler pledges to expand protected bike and bus lanes, end free curbside parking, and push for weight-based vehicle fees. He argues that current subsidies—free parking, gas-tax holidays, and slow-walked congestion pricing—endanger New Yorkers, especially those outside cars.

These provisions were stripped during negotiations, leaving only the round-the-clock camera operation. Assembly Member Glick said, 'keeping the cameras on 24/7 was that hill.' Mayor Eric Adams called it 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives.' Advocacy groups and lawmakers voiced frustration at Albany’s reluctance to adopt stronger safety tools.

Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, representing District 66, cosponsors the legislation. The bill awaits City Council approval. The measure allows cameras to operate 24/7, instead of limited weekday hours. The matter summary states: 'State lawmakers have reached a deal to extend and expand a New York City traffic camera program that has ticketed reckless drivers in school zones since 2013.' Glick said, 'Speeding, as we all know, has become more prolific during the pandemic.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Senate sponsor, said, 'Speed cameras save lives.' Mayor Adams called the bill a 'major victory for New Yorkers.' City data shows speeding dropped 72% during camera hours. The extension aims to curb rising traffic violence and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to prohibit commercial establishments—repair shops, rental agencies, maintenance shops—from parking, storing, or idling vehicles on city streets. The matter summary states: 'This bill would prohibit commercial establishments from parking vehicles on city streets as part of their business.' Civil penalties ranged from $250 to $400 per day, with possible impoundment. Sponsors included Kalman Yeger (primary), Carlina Rivera, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kevin C. Riley, Marjorie Velázquez, Erik D. Bottcher, Nantasha M. Williams, and Robert F. Holden. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst assessment was provided. The bill’s failure leaves streets crowded with commercial vehicles, keeping vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Bob Holden sponsored two more bills targeting cars with exterior speakers and personal audio devices. The matter, titled 'Pols Want City Crackdown on Car Noise, But Health Department is Silent,' highlights council frustration with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which has not acted. Council Member Carlina Rivera called noise pollution a public health crisis and urged health-focused street design, citing the 14th Street busway. Transportation Alternatives backed the bills, pushing for more pedestrian and green space. Dr. Arline Bronzaft and other experts criticized the Health Department's inaction.

City defends slow rollout.</p><p class=mb3>On May 10, 2022, advocates criticized the Clean Curbs pilot, a $1.3-million initiative announced in 2020 and led by the Department of Sanitation (DSNY). The pilot aims to reduce sidewalk trash piles by testing curbside enclosures. The commercial phase launched with two, four-bin units in Times Square, funded by the Times Square Alliance. The residential phase will cover a single Manhattan block, using nine enclosures and removing six parking spaces. Advocates argue, as the matter states, 'the city's 'Clean Curbs' pilot is too small and unambitious to be scalable citywide.' Council Member Erik Bottcher, a leader on trash issues, is linked to the pilot’s district but declined comment. Local group CHEKPEDS also declined. Advocates want a broader test, more bins, and better truck equipment. DSNY spokesman Vincent Gragnani says, 'The $1.3-million Clean Curbs pilot is exactly that, a pilot that will allow us to see what works and what does not work.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
