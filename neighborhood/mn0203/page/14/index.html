A car keeps going. Blood on the pavement, a head wound, a life changed. In the last twelve months, West Village saw 97 people injured and 3 seriously hurt in 220 crashes. No one was killed in that period, but four have died since 2022. Pedestrians, cyclists, drivers. No one is spared.</p><p>A uniformed officer walks to his car at dawn. A Dodge Charger, speeding, spins out after hitting a street sweeper. The officer tries to run. He does not make it. The car pins him to his own cruiser. Both men survive, but not unscathed. &ldquo;The driver of the Charger appeared to be speeding,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/14/nypd-officer-struck-and-pinned-by-out-of-control-dodge-charger-in-manhattan/>said a witness</a>. The officer is rushed to the hospital. The driver is taken into custody. Charges are pending. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/greenwich-village-officer-struck-cop-injured-control-dodge-charger-manhattan/16022235/>&ldquo;The officer was pinned between the Charger and a marked police vehicle,&rdquo;</a> police said.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Cars and trucks do the most harm. Since 2022, they killed two and seriously injured four. Bikes and mopeds hurt, too, but the numbers are smaller. The street does not care who you are. It takes children, the old, the young, the strong. In the last year, five people under 18 were injured. One was a child.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The mayor calls every death one too many. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. The council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. Each day they wait, the street claims another.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Tell Albany to keep the cameras on. Stand with those who have lost. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Change it. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Members Gale A. Brewer (primary), Justin L. Brannan, Erik D. Bottcher, Kalman Yeger, and Lincoln Restler sponsored the measure. The bill sought to codify an existing city rule (34 RCNY 4-12(j)), making it illegal to operate, stand, or park vehicles for commercial advertising. Violators would face a $500 penalty. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

The change would broaden the definition of 'processing device,' letting more vehicles idle legally. Manhattan Community Board 4 voted unanimously to reject the change, warning, 'These exemptions... would create an argument that just about any activity that requires power in a vehicle is an idling defense.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman testified, 'Drivers most often idle in front of highly trafficked pedestrian areas... those that live near large roadways face serious health repercussions.' Advocates, residents, and Dr. Patrick Schnell all opposed the proposal, citing health and environmental harm. Spectrum requested a variance, but all testimony opposed it. The DEP claims the change clarifies the law, but enforcement is already weak and large companies are frequent violators.

No summons was issued to the driver or passenger for the illegal act. The area, plagued by 913 crashes in three years, has injured dozens of cyclists and pedestrians. Council Member Erik Bottcher and State Senator Brad Hoylman responded by rallying with advocacy groups, demanding protected bike lanes on 10th and 11th avenues. Hoylman tweeted, 'The City must make the streets of the West Side safer!' The Hudson River Greenway, a nearby bike path, bans legal e-bikes, forcing riders like Kwan onto dangerous streets. This was the city’s first cyclist death of 2022, amid a rising toll of road fatalities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure urges passage of S.4037/A.5896, which would 'extend and expand the scope of the MTA On-Demand E-Hail Paratransit Pilot Program.' Council Member Justin L. Brannan led sponsorship, joined by Ayala, Menin, Louis, Hanif, Hudson, Bottcher, Farías, Brooks-Powers, and Brewer. The resolution slams service caps and fare surcharges, calling them 'inequitable and unjust.' It demands that paratransit users get the same fare, hours, and ride freedom as subway and bus riders. The bill would end rationing and financial barriers for disabled New Yorkers who rely on Access-A-Ride. The Council’s action highlights the systemic barriers faced by vulnerable road users and presses for equal, unrestricted access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hall remains bare.</p><p class=mb3>On February 4, 2022, a group of Manhattan elected officials, including State Senator Brad Hoylman, sent a letter demanding public seating at Moynihan Train Hall. The matter, titled 'Legislators Demand Public Seating at the Moynihan Train Hall,' highlights the lack of benches in the busy transit hub. The letter states, 'To ensure everyone can enjoy this public good, we request the installation of additional seating.' Lawmakers Hoylman, Nadler, Jackson, Gottfried, Levine, and Bottcher signed the letter. They note that the small waiting area for ticketed passengers is not enough, forcing travelers—especially seniors—to sit on the floor or wander in search of a seat. The officials reject exclusionary design that targets unhoused people, urging services and outreach instead. Amtrak has not responded. The push for seating centers the needs of all passengers, especially the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
