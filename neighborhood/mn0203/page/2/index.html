A car keeps going. Blood on the pavement, a head wound, a life changed. In the last twelve months, West Village saw 97 people injured and 3 seriously hurt in 220 crashes. No one was killed in that period, but four have died since 2022. Pedestrians, cyclists, drivers. No one is spared.</p><p>A uniformed officer walks to his car at dawn. A Dodge Charger, speeding, spins out after hitting a street sweeper. The officer tries to run. He does not make it. The car pins him to his own cruiser. Both men survive, but not unscathed. &ldquo;The driver of the Charger appeared to be speeding,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/14/nypd-officer-struck-and-pinned-by-out-of-control-dodge-charger-in-manhattan/>said a witness</a>. The officer is rushed to the hospital. The driver is taken into custody. Charges are pending. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/greenwich-village-officer-struck-cop-injured-control-dodge-charger-manhattan/16022235/>&ldquo;The officer was pinned between the Charger and a marked police vehicle,&rdquo;</a> police said.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Cars and trucks do the most harm. Since 2022, they killed two and seriously injured four. Bikes and mopeds hurt, too, but the numbers are smaller. The street does not care who you are. It takes children, the old, the young, the strong. In the last year, five people under 18 were injured. One was a child.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The mayor calls every death one too many. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. The council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. Each day they wait, the street claims another.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Tell Albany to keep the cameras on. Stand with those who have lost. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Change it. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, part of the city’s Streets Plan, was announced by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Council Member Erik Bottcher, representing District 3, praised the completion, saying, “By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike.” The new lane replaces a car lane, widens space for bikes, and redesigns intersections to shorten pedestrian crossings and slow turning vehicles. Transportation advocates and Manhattan Community Board 2 support the project. DOT data shows protected bike lanes cut total deaths and serious injuries by 18.1%, and pedestrian deaths and serious injuries by 29.1%.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brad Hoylman-Sigal leads as primary sponsor, joined by Jabari Brisport, Kristen Gonzalez, Liz Krueger, Jessica Ramos, and Julia Salazar as co-sponsors. These lawmakers seek to use automated cameras to enforce bike lane rules, targeting drivers who endanger cyclists by blocking protected lanes. The bill does not blame victims.

The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas.

The bill blocks sales to unlicensed buyers. It aims to regulate e-scooters but leaves questions for those on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill 116, now in sponsorship, sits in the Assembly. Filed January 1, 2025, it seeks to 'establish a bicycle and electric scooter operator's safety manual; provide for the issuance of a license for residents who successfully read and comprehend the operator's safety manual; require residents who operate an electric scooter in New York City to have a license to operate such devices; require instruction in electric scooter safety as part of the drivers pre-licensing course; require liability insurance for electric scooters in cities having a population of one million or more; prohibit the sale of an electric scooter to a purchaser unless the purchaser has a license to operate the electric scooter and has insurance in a city having a population of one million or more.' Assemblymember John Zaccaro Jr. leads sponsorship, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Michael Benedetto, Deborah Glick, David McDonough, and Michael Novakhov. The bill targets e-scooter operators, not drivers of larger vehicles. No safety analyst has assessed its impact on pedestrians or cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
