Senators advanced <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a> to require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with heavy violation records; Sen. Kevin Parker voted yes in committee on June 11 and 12, 2025 <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>.

After a hit‑and‑run in Bushwick, “Police were looking … for the driver” who dragged a man more than 50 feet. “Criminal charges … were still pending” in another case.

Over 200 signed a pledge after Mayor Adams decided to strip three blocks of protection, despite city data showing the lanes made the street 'dramatically safer.' The move follows a court ruling allowing the change. City Hall claims the redesign addresses 'serious safety concerns.' Legal precedent (Turturro v. City of New York) could hold the city liable for knowingly making streets less safe. Advocates see the decision as political, not safety-driven.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.'

The program, which turns routine traffic violations by cyclists into criminal summonses, will go citywide by the end of August. The matter, reported by Streetsblog NYC as 'The Crackdown This Time Edition,' drew sharp criticism from advocates and riders. Council Member Mercedes Narcisse acknowledged drivers as the main threat to pedestrians but called for consideration of drivers in transit deserts. Mayor Adams promised to consult with communities before redesigning streets. Safety analysts warn: expanding this enforcement targets vulnerable road users, discourages cycling, and shifts blame from drivers and infrastructure.
