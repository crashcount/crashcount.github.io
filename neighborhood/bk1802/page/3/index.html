Vote split, but the message is clear: streets must serve people, not just cars.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill S 915, titled 'Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles,' passed committee on June 9, 2025. The bill, sponsored by Sean Ryan (District 61) with co-sponsors Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Samra Brouk, Leroy Comrie, Patricia Fahy, Pete Harckham, Robert Jackson, Liz Krueger, and Christopher Ryan, pushes for roads built for everyone. The Senate voted, with most in favor and a block opposed. The bill's language is blunt: roads must be safe for all, not just drivers. No safety analyst note was provided, but the intent is clear—prioritize vulnerable road users in every street plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City Council Member Mercedes Narcisse announced plans to introduce a bill mandating ferry service for Canarsie, citing 'a transportation desert' and the need for better connections. Jibreel Jalloh, leading the rally, said, 'We must bridge this gap and demand the connectivity we deserve.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams backed the call, while Sheryl Boyce stressed the need for accessible transit. City Hall said there are no current plans for a new line. According to safety analysts, adding a ferry route mainly improves transit access; without better walking or biking links to the dock, the impact on vulnerable road users remains minimal.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s crackdown missed the real threat.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on May 16, 2025, that a 68-year-old woman, Maurette Lafleur, was killed by a driver while crossing Rutland Road at E. 95th Street in East Flatbush. Lafleur was in the crosswalk with the walk signal when the driver of a 2025 Mercedes Benz GLC 300 struck her. A witness told Streetsblog, "The lady spin around and sped through," and described hearing the impact. The article notes that police have not released the driver's name. The incident occurred as NYPD focused enforcement on electric bikes, while drivers continue to cause deadly harm. The tragedy highlights the ongoing danger to pedestrians and raises questions about city policy and street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
