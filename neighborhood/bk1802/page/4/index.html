On May 25, 2025, at Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U, a fire truck struck 30-year-old Valentin Ivancsuk. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The fire truck was running lights and sirens. The FDNY said only, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/motorcyclist-killed-crash-fire-truck-marine-park-brooklyn/16551852/>&ldquo;incident is under investigation.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He is not alone. In the last twelve months, <strong>two people have died</strong> on these streets. <strong>190 more were injured</strong>. One was a child. One was 75. The oldest killed was 89, crushed behind the wheel. The youngest injured was under 18. The numbers do not stop. They do not care.</p><h3 id=the-relentless-grind-of-injury>The Relentless Grind of Injury</h3><p><strong>268 crashes</strong> in one year. <strong>One serious injury.</strong> The rest, pain that lingers. Broken arms, bleeding heads, bodies thrown from bikes and cars. Most injuries come from cars and SUVs. Some from buses. None from bikes. The streets do not forgive mistakes. They punish the slow, the old, the distracted, the young.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. There are new laws. Speed cameras. Lower limits. But here, the carnage continues. No local leader has stood in front of the cameras to say enough. No council member has called for a redesign of Flatbush or Avenue U. No press release. No plan. Only the slow drip of blood and numbers.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices. Streets can be changed. Speeds can be lowered. Cameras can be kept on. But only if you demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the power they have. Tell them to stop waiting. <strong>Every day of silence is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children.

The report identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the contributing factor, indicating a failure by one or both drivers to obey traffic signals or signs. The SUV’s front center end collided with the sedan’s right side doors, causing damage consistent with a side-impact collision. No victim behaviors were listed as contributing factors.

Narcisse stressed, 'Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.' The legislation removes jaywalking as a pretext for police stops, though officers may still intervene for other reasons. The Department of Transportation must now educate the public on street rights and responsibilities.

Racial bias in enforcement remains unaddressed.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2024, the City Council delayed action on a bill to legalize jaywalking. The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with advocates demanding stronger protections for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
