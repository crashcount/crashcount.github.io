They do not care.</p><h3 id=the-relentless-grind-of-injury>The Relentless Grind of Injury</h3><p><strong>268 crashes</strong> in one year. <strong>One serious injury.</strong> The rest, pain that lingers. Broken arms, bleeding heads, bodies thrown from bikes and cars. Most injuries come from cars and SUVs. Some from buses. None from bikes. The streets do not forgive mistakes. They punish the slow, the old, the distracted, the young.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. There are new laws. Speed cameras. Lower limits. But here, the carnage continues. No local leader has stood in front of the cameras to say enough. No council member has called for a redesign of Flatbush or Avenue U. No press release. No plan. Only the slow drip of blood and numbers.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices. Streets can be changed. Speeds can be lowered. Cameras can be kept on. But only if you demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the power they have. Tell them to stop waiting. <strong>Every day of silence is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
