It bleeds slow. In the last twelve months, 220 people have been hurt in crashes. Five were left with serious injuries. No one died. But the numbers do not comfort. They only count the bodies that made it home, broken but breathing. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>Pedestrians cross, drivers do not see. A 37-year-old man, head split open, crossing Fulton Street. A 76-year-old struck at an intersection, blood on the pavement. A 44-year-old, hit by a bus, incoherent on the curb. These are not rare stories. They are the drumbeat of the neighborhood.</p><h3 id=what-has-changed>What Has Changed?</h3><p>No deaths this year. But the risk is everywhere. In three years, Ocean Hill saw 841 injuries, 9 serious. The streets do not forgive. Cars, SUVs, bikes, buses—each leaves its mark. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They promise safer crossings, lower speeds, more cameras. But the pace is slow. The city now has the power to set a 20 mph speed limit. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany does not act. The tools are there. The will is not.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The most vulnerable pay first. Children, elders, those on foot. In the last year, 15 kids were hurt. Eight people over 75. The old and the young do not win in a contest with steel.</p><h3 id=act-or-wait-for-blood>Act or Wait for Blood</h3><p>This is not fate. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Demand leaders use the power they have. Call your council member. Call the mayor. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p><p>Every day of delay is another name on a chart. Another family waiting in an ER.

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) admitted the overhaul would not start until late 2024, with citywide coverage years away. The matter, described as a fix for a 'free-for-all system that led to reckless driving and fatalities,' remains stalled. Council Members Lincoln Restler and Julie Menin pressed DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch on the slow pace and shifting deadlines. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who introduced the original legislation, stressed the need for clear guidance. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure highlighted the deadly consequences of delay. DSNY opposes a bill from Council Member Sandy Nurse to create a working group to address these setbacks.

The bill cited the city’s reliance on trucks—89% of freight—fueling congestion, pollution, and risk for everyone outside a vehicle. The Council pointed to pilot programs like Blue Highways as a way to clear streets and cut emissions. But the resolution was filed without action. Trucks still rule the road.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to force progress on the 2019 law that would replace a chaotic, dangerous carting system with 20 regulated zones. The matter summary states: 'A Brooklyn Council member, Sandy Nurse, is seeking to revive the city's stalled effort to reform the private carting industry by introducing legislation to create a working group.' Nurse pushes for quarterly meetings with city officials, industry, and labor until the program launches. Mayor Adams and Sanitation Commissioner Tisch have delayed the law, citing cost concerns. Nurse insists, 'We are not going backwards. This is something that needs to happen.' The City Council will hold a hearing. Streets remain unsafe for those outside cars until the city acts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to amend city law to require the Department of Transportation to finish all street resurfacing work within two weeks. If more time was needed, the department would have to notify the community, stating the reason and new timeline. The matter summary reads: 'ensure that all work associated with the resurfacing of any street is finalized within 2 weeks from the start of work.' Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by thirty other members. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst reviewed the impact, but torn-up streets are a known threat to pedestrians and cyclists. The bill is dead.
