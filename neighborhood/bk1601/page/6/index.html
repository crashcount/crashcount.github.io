In the last twelve months, 285 people were hurt in crashes here. Five were left with serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, men and women—none spared. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken bones, torn skin, and lives that do not heal.</p><p>Just last week, a cyclist was left bleeding from the head at Somers Street and Broadway. A bus passed too close.

Trucks and buses hit eight, one seriously. Motorcycles and mopeds struck six. Bikes, too, hurt four, one badly. No one is safe—not on foot, not on two wheels, not at any hour.</p><h2 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored the bill to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Latrice Walker did the same. But the work is not done. Parking is still allowed up to the crosswalk in much of the district. Council Member Darlene Mealy co-sponsored a bill to ban it, but the law is not yet in force. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>see votes</a></p><p><strong>Some leaders speak, but the streets stay the same.</strong> As one advocate <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said after another Brooklyn crash</a>, &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every injury is a failure. Every delay is a choice. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them: <strong>No more waiting. No more blood. Make Ocean Hill safe. Now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

'It wasn't something that was pushed for specifically by Council Member Nurse,' spokesperson Patricia Santana told Streetsblog." -- Sandy Nurse</p><p class=mb3>On February 26, 2025, the City Council approved Mayor Adams's 'City of Yes' rezoning. The bill divided the city into zones: the Manhattan core, an inner transit zone with no parking mandates, an outer transit zone with reduced mandates, and areas beyond where mandates mostly remain. The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.' Council Member Sandy Nurse’s district saw mandates shaped by community board amendments, not her advocacy. Dan Garodnick, Department of City Planning chair, said, 'parking and housing are no longer coming into conflict in the parts of New York City that are well-served by transit.' The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others.
