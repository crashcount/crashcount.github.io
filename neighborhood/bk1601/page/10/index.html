In the last twelve months, 285 people were hurt in crashes here. Five were left with serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, men and women—none spared. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken bones, torn skin, and lives that do not heal.</p><p>Just last week, a cyclist was left bleeding from the head at Somers Street and Broadway. A bus passed too close.

Trucks and buses hit eight, one seriously. Motorcycles and mopeds struck six. Bikes, too, hurt four, one badly. No one is safe—not on foot, not on two wheels, not at any hour.</p><h2 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored the bill to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Latrice Walker did the same. But the work is not done. Parking is still allowed up to the crosswalk in much of the district. Council Member Darlene Mealy co-sponsored a bill to ban it, but the law is not yet in force. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>see votes</a></p><p><strong>Some leaders speak, but the streets stay the same.</strong> As one advocate <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said after another Brooklyn crash</a>, &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every injury is a failure. Every delay is a choice. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them: <strong>No more waiting. No more blood. Make Ocean Hill safe.

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.

The report states the vehicle's center front end hit the pedestrian's head, causing severe lacerations and leaving him bleeding but conscious on the pavement. The driver of the SUV held only a learner’s permit at the time of the crash, as documented in the police report. The report does not specify any additional driver errors or contributing factors beyond the driver’s license status. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but the police report does not list these as contributing factors—only as the location and action. The collision underscores the dangers faced by pedestrians on city streets, especially when drivers lack full licensure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution. The program’s future remains uncertain, with vulnerable road users facing continued risk from unchecked car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
