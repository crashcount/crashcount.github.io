It bleeds slow. In the last twelve months, 220 people have been hurt in crashes. Five were left with serious injuries. No one died. But the numbers do not comfort. They only count the bodies that made it home, broken but breathing. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>Pedestrians cross, drivers do not see. A 37-year-old man, head split open, crossing Fulton Street. A 76-year-old struck at an intersection, blood on the pavement. A 44-year-old, hit by a bus, incoherent on the curb. These are not rare stories. They are the drumbeat of the neighborhood.</p><h3 id=what-has-changed>What Has Changed?</h3><p>No deaths this year. But the risk is everywhere. In three years, Ocean Hill saw 841 injuries, 9 serious. The streets do not forgive. Cars, SUVs, bikes, buses—each leaves its mark. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They promise safer crossings, lower speeds, more cameras. But the pace is slow. The city now has the power to set a 20 mph speed limit. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany does not act. The tools are there. The will is not.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The most vulnerable pay first. Children, elders, those on foot. In the last year, 15 kids were hurt. Eight people over 75. The old and the young do not win in a contest with steel.</p><h3 id=act-or-wait-for-blood>Act or Wait for Blood</h3><p>This is not fate. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Demand leaders use the power they have. Call your council member. Call the mayor. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p><p>Every day of delay is another name on a chart. Another family waiting in an ER.

The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year.

The system failed to stop the car.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-04-01) reports renewed calls for the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill after a Brooklyn crash killed a mother and two children. The driver, with a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' struck the family as they crossed the street. The bill would require speed-limiting technology for drivers with repeated offenses—those with 11 or more points in 24 months, or six camera tickets in a year. Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, citing the crash, demand action: 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair... it’s time for us to act.' The incident highlights gaps in enforcement and the stalled progress of safety legislation meant to curb reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
