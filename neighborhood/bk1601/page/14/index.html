In the last twelve months, 285 people were hurt in crashes here. Five were left with serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, men and women—none spared. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken bones, torn skin, and lives that do not heal.</p><p>Just last week, a cyclist was left bleeding from the head at Somers Street and Broadway. A bus passed too close. The man was left incoherent, blood pooling on the pavement. He was forty. He survived.

Trucks and buses hit eight, one seriously. Motorcycles and mopeds struck six. Bikes, too, hurt four, one badly. No one is safe—not on foot, not on two wheels, not at any hour.</p><h2 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored the bill to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Latrice Walker did the same. But the work is not done. Parking is still allowed up to the crosswalk in much of the district. Council Member Darlene Mealy co-sponsored a bill to ban it, but the law is not yet in force. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>see votes</a></p><p><strong>Some leaders speak, but the streets stay the same.</strong> As one advocate <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said after another Brooklyn crash</a>, &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every injury is a failure. Every delay is a choice. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them: <strong>No more waiting. No more blood. Make Ocean Hill safe.

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
