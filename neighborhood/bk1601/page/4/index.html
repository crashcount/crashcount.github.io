It bleeds slow. In the last twelve months, 220 people have been hurt in crashes. Five were left with serious injuries. No one died. But the numbers do not comfort. They only count the bodies that made it home, broken but breathing. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>Pedestrians cross, drivers do not see. A 37-year-old man, head split open, crossing Fulton Street. A 76-year-old struck at an intersection, blood on the pavement. A 44-year-old, hit by a bus, incoherent on the curb. These are not rare stories. They are the drumbeat of the neighborhood.</p><h3 id=what-has-changed>What Has Changed?</h3><p>No deaths this year. But the risk is everywhere. In three years, Ocean Hill saw 841 injuries, 9 serious. The streets do not forgive. Cars, SUVs, bikes, buses—each leaves its mark. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They promise safer crossings, lower speeds, more cameras. But the pace is slow. The city now has the power to set a 20 mph speed limit. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany does not act. The tools are there. The will is not.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The most vulnerable pay first. Children, elders, those on foot. In the last year, 15 kids were hurt. Eight people over 75. The old and the young do not win in a contest with steel.</p><h3 id=act-or-wait-for-blood>Act or Wait for Blood</h3><p>This is not fate. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Demand leaders use the power they have. Call your council member. Call the mayor. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p><p>Every day of delay is another name on a chart. Another family waiting in an ER.

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'expanding the delivery worker minimum wage to grocery delivery workers,' drew sharp lines. Council Member Sandy Nurse (D-Brooklyn), sponsor, blasted industry claims that fair pay would hurt food-insecure New Yorkers, calling them 'absurd and thoughtless.' The Chamber of Progress, representing Instacart and others, testified against the bills. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) and advocacy groups testified in favor, with Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga stating, 'This package of bills would close that gap.' Economic experts argued that previous wage hikes did not raise prices for consumers. Advocates for immigrant and Muslim workers demanded equal wage protections. The hearing exposed the rift between industry and worker safety, with the Council siding with vulnerable workers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
