Three were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm.</strong> In this period, they caused 75 pedestrian injuries. Trucks and buses added six more. No bikes, mopeds, or motorcycles killed or seriously hurt a pedestrian here. The danger is heavy and made of steel.</p><h3 id=the-names-we-lose>The Names We Lose</h3><p>The numbers hide the faces. A sedan strikes a pedestrian in a crosswalk. A bus hits someone stepping from a parked car. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade. <strong>&ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family,&rdquo;</strong> a brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said after a crash took a life in Brooklyn</a>. <strong>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</strong></p><h3 id=what-leaders-doand-dont>What Leaders Do—And Don’t</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have not delivered enough.</strong> State Senator Andrew Lanza <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against safer school speed zones for children—again and again</a>. Assembly Member Mike Tannousis missed key votes. Council Member Joseph Borelli has stayed silent. The policies that could slow the killing—lower speed limits, more cameras, real consequences for repeat offenders—wait for courage.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Our message to drivers was clear: follow the rules or face the law,&rdquo;</strong> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/vision-zero.shtml#:~:text=,a%20vision%20%E2%80%94it%27s%20a%20reality">said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch</a>, but the law is slow and the dead do not return.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, more families lose. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras at every school. Demand that repeat speeders lose their keys. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season. The incident raises questions about internal discipline and the risks posed by impaired driving, even among law enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities.

Brad Hoylman-Sigal (District 47) joined the debate over New York’s congestion pricing plan. The original $15 toll was paused by Governor Hochul in June. Now, officials consider a lower toll or alternatives to fund the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'we need congestion pricing.' The matter, titled 'MTA boss ‘thrilled’ Kathy Hochul eyeing lower congestion toll after NY gov indefinitely paused controversial scheme,' highlights the urgency of MTA financing. Assemblywoman Deborah Glick noted Hochul’s commitment to a replacement plan. The bill’s status remains in flux, with no committee or vote recorded. The safety impact for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—was not assessed. The city’s most at-risk remain exposed as leaders argue over dollars and cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their letter to Governor Hochul followed Brown’s June comments suggesting Staten Island lose its promised 75 new R211S railcars because local lawmakers opposed congestion pricing. The letter, signed by Assemblymen Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Tannousis, Michael Reilly, Borough President Vito Fossella, State Senator Andrew Lanza, Councilman David Carr, and Borelli, called Brown’s remarks 'a masterclass in bureaucratic ignorance.' Brown said he would welcome removal. The new railcars would replace aging trains from the 1970s. The matter exposes deep rifts over transit funding and priorities, with Staten Island riders caught in the crossfire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
