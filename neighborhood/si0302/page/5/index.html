One hundred thirty-eight injured in the last year.</strong> In Great Kills-Eltingville, the numbers do not lie. They do not soften. They do not care. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crashes</a> come steady as rain—261 in the last twelve months. One person suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Twenty-five children were hurt. The oldest victim was seventy-five, the youngest under eighteen. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs caused the most harm. Nine pedestrians were struck by sedans, seven by SUVs, and others by buses, trucks, and vehicles left &ldquo;unspecified.&rdquo; Bikes and motorcycles did not kill here, but the threat from larger vehicles is constant. The street is not a safe place for the unprotected.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of safety. The streets say otherwise.</strong> The city claims progress—lower speed limits, more cameras, new laws. But in Great Kills-Eltingville, the pace is glacial. The carnage continues. There is no record of bold action from district leaders. No public fight for more protected crossings, no push for street redesigns, no outcry for stricter enforcement. Silence is not safety.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward>The Path Forward</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every injury is a failure. The city has the tools: speed limits, cameras, street redesigns. But tools unused are as useless as promises unkept.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Ask for lower speed limits, more cameras, and streets built for people, not just cars. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not silent.

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects.
