Brewer, speaking at an E-Vehicle Safety Alliance town hall, said, "I will sign on to that bill. That's not an issue." She attributes her change to the existence of state bills and constituent pressure, but refuses to back Council Member Bob Holden's city bill. Julie Menin also endorsed strict registration and park bans. Critics, including advocacy groups, warn these measures will hit low-wage, immigrant delivery workers hardest and undermine efforts to reduce car use. Data shows pedestrian injuries from e-bikes remain flat, while cars cause most harm. Brewer's shift marks a retreat from policies that protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not tied to a specific bill number, is led by the Department of Transportation and replaces a traffic lane in each direction between West End Avenue and 2nd Avenue. The matter aims to 'speed up crosstown buses like the M96 and M106.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, has sided with residents opposing the change, though she did not comment for the record. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the new lane will make commutes 'faster, more reliable, and safer for everyone.' The bus lane will operate 24/7, except for a short eastbound stretch. DOT notes that 74% of 96th Street residents do not own cars, and most commute by transit, bike, or foot.

The matter, titled 'DOT begins construction of new bus lanes along Manhattan’s 96th Street,' aims to improve service for 15,500 weekday riders. Councilmember Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, held a rally earlier in the month expressing concerns about lost curb space and pushed for alternative solutions. Brewer sent a letter to DOT on behalf of residents, stating, 'All I can say is that I did what I did to represent them.' DOT officials countered that the redesign will reduce congestion and retain curb access. The project includes dedicated bus lanes, left-turn bays, and treatments to slow drivers. Most residents in the area rely on transit, walking, or cycling.

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights.

Residents rally. DOT wants faster buses. Brewer demands alternatives. The fight pits transit speed against curb access. DOT vows to move forward. Riders wait.</p><p class=mb3>On September 5, 2024, Councilmember Gale A. Brewer (District 6) joined Upper West Side residents to oppose the Department of Transportation’s plan for dedicated bus lanes on 96th Street. The proposal, announced in May, would convert a traffic lane in each direction to bus-only use between First and West End avenues, aiming to speed up the M96 and M106 routes. Brewer, who previously supported bus lanes elsewhere, told the crowd, 'There are concerns that we have. I think that you have to look at alternatives to making the bus go faster.' The matter, titled by Gothamist as 'Yet another NYC bus lane plan faces big fight, this time from angry Upper West Siders,' highlights tension between transit improvements and local access. DOT officials say the lanes will help over 15,000 daily bus riders. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT aims to speed up slow buses for 15,000 daily riders. Locals cite residential concerns. Debate pits transit needs against curb access. No clear resolution.</p><p class=mb3>On September 5, 2024, Council Member Shaun Abreu of District 7 joined Upper West Side residents in questioning the Department of Transportation's plan for a 24/7 offset bus lane on 96th Street. The DOT proposal, intended to speed up the M96 bus for 15,000 daily riders, would repurpose a travel lane in each direction while preserving curb parking. Abreu stated, "I wouldn’t say I’m opposed or in favor at this point," but called for more clarity and adjustments from DOT. The matter, described as a push to 'torpedo planned bus lane on 96th Street,' has drawn support from East Side's Community Board 8 and opposition from West Side locals and Council Member Gale Brewer, who suggested alternatives like bus signal priority. The debate centers on balancing transit improvements with residential curb access. No formal committee action or safety analysis has been reported.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report lists 'Pavement Defective' twice as contributing factors, indicating road conditions caused the crash. The cyclist sustained chest injuries and internal complaints, classified as injury severity level 3. The bike's point of impact was the center front end, and the vehicle damage was noted as 'Other.' The rider was not wearing any safety equipment. No driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding were cited, as this was a single-vehicle crash.

Riders with disabilities can reach platforms once blocked. The overhaul cost $300 million. More elevators are coming. But 23 other stations wait, stalled by lost congestion pricing funds. Access remains uneven. Riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On August 22, 2024, construction finished on three new elevators at the 14th Street subway complex, serving the F, M, and L lines, with connections to the 1, 2, and 3. The project, a $300 million overhaul, is part of ongoing MTA accessibility efforts. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents District 47, praised the work: "There is a fundamental right to access mass transit. And today we are taking an important step forward in making that right real to all New Yorkers." The upgrades will make the complex fully accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Still, 23 other stations remain on hold after congestion pricing was paused, freezing $15 billion in planned improvements. Only 30% of stations are accessible. The future for vulnerable riders is uncertain without new funding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
