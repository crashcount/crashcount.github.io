Over a hundred injured.</strong> That’s just this year so far in Upper West Side (Central). The numbers do not flinch. Two elders—one 75, one 55—are gone. A 57-year-old cyclist was crushed by a truck on West 76th. A 69-year-old woman was killed crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th. A 57-year-old man died under the wheels of an SUV at Broadway and 86th. The street does not care if you are careful. It does not care if you have the light. It does not care if you are old or young.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and sedans killed three pedestrians here. They left dozens more broken. Trucks and buses hit twelve people. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the carnage comes on four wheels.

Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal pushed for it. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted to curb repeat speeders with speed limiters</a>. But the city drags its feet. The default speed is still 25. The dead keep coming. &ldquo;Every day you wait risks another family losing someone they love.&rdquo; <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a></p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. The street will not wait.

The matter, described as a conflict over 'the implementation of street safety improvements, particularly protected bike lanes and bus lanes,' exposes deep rifts. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez asked council members for input; only six of 51 replied. Council Member Gale Brewer cited ignored past outreach. Joe Borelli dismissed bike lanes and DOT’s efforts. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers insisted the agency, not lawmakers, must pick locations. The city is failing to meet legal benchmarks for new lanes. Mayor Adams has sidelined mandates for community feedback. Advocates blame both the council and mayor for delays, missed projects, and rising danger. Decisive leadership is missing.

Law aims to protect lives, streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2024, the City Council passed a package of bills led by Councilmember Gale A. Brewer (District 6). The legislation, heard in committee and passed on this date, increases penalties for businesses selling uncertified e-bikes and scooters with dangerous lithium-ion batteries. Brewer said, 'We are not only going after the batteries, we are going after the stores that are selling the batteries.' The FDNY will now assist the Department of Consumer and Worker Protections in enforcement. Fines for repeat violators can reach $2,000. Brewer’s second bill requires e-bike sellers to post safety information in stores and online, with fines up to $350. Councilmember Julie Menin sponsored additional reforms easing street vendor regulations and banning vending in bike lanes. The bills respond to a deadly spike in battery fires—18 killed in 2023, triple the previous year. Lawmakers aim to protect vulnerable road users and workers who rely on these devices.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Workers pay steep fees to keep earning and avoid losing their rides.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published February 21, 2024, details the surge in moped registrations among New York City delivery workers. DMV data show ZIP codes with many deliveristas now lead in registered mopeds. The article quotes workers like Junior Pichardo, who says, 'If you have plates, [the police] won’t summons you.' Eric Macario and William Medina, both delivery workers, highlight confusion and lack of information about registration and insurance. Medina blames sellers for failing to inform buyers. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores have introduced a bill to require sellers to register mopeds before sale, but it remains pending. For now, advocates help workers navigate the system. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project says many only learn the rules after police seize their mopeds or issue tickets. The crackdown exposes systemic gaps, leaving vulnerable workers to bear the cost and risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City workers swept the span at midnight. Tourists walked free of tables and hawkers. The walkway opened up. No ducking, weaving, or crowding. The city seized eight vendor tables. The bridge stayed packed, but clear.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2024, the city implemented a total vendor ban on the Brooklyn Bridge. The Department of Transportation and NYPD cleared all souvenir stands and food sellers at midnight. A sign now reads, 'No vending allowed.' Councilmember Gale A. Brewer, District 6, was mentioned for introducing a related bill last month to restrict sales only on narrow sections. Mayor Eric Adams said, 'Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety.' The ban aims to improve pedestrian flow on the crowded bridge, which sees over 34,000 walkers on a fall weekend. Supporters of vendors mourned the loss of affordable food and art. Tourists welcomed the extra space and easier passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Officials claim the move will ease crowding and reduce danger for walkers. Vendors, many disabled or veterans, say the ban guts their livelihoods overnight.</p><p class=mb3>On January 2, 2024, City Hall announced a blanket ban on street vendors from city bridges, effective January 3. The policy, not a council bill but a mayoral action, follows months of warnings and public debate. Mayor Adams said, "Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety." The Department of Transportation cited overcrowding and safety risks on the Brooklyn Bridge, where daily pedestrian numbers have doubled since 2021. Vendors and advocates, including Mohamed Attia of the Street Vendor Project, condemned the ban for stripping workers—many disabled or veterans—of income with no safety net. Upper West Side Council Member Gale Brewer proposed a compromise bill to allow regulated vending on wider bridge sections, but the administration pushed ahead with a total ban. The city claims the measure will protect pedestrians, but offers no new space or support for displaced vendors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
