Over a hundred injured.</strong> That’s just this year so far in Upper West Side (Central). The numbers do not flinch. Two elders—one 75, one 55—are gone. A 57-year-old cyclist was crushed by a truck on West 76th. A 69-year-old woman was killed crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th. A 57-year-old man died under the wheels of an SUV at Broadway and 86th. The street does not care if you are careful. It does not care if you have the light. It does not care if you are old or young.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and sedans killed three pedestrians here. They left dozens more broken. Trucks and buses hit twelve people. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the carnage comes on four wheels. The city’s own data shows it: &ldquo;A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The math is brutal.&rdquo; <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a></p><h3 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h3><p><strong>The law now lets the city lower the speed limit to 20 mph.</strong> Albany <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/albany-lawmakers-sammys-law-allow-nyc-lower-speed-limit-20-mph/>passed Sammy’s Law</a>. Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal pushed for it. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted to curb repeat speeders with speed limiters</a>. But the city drags its feet. The default speed is still 25. The dead keep coming. &ldquo;Every day you wait risks another family losing someone they love.&rdquo; <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a></p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. The street will not wait.

Police crackdowns and ticket threats push them to comply. Advocates step in, guiding new immigrants through red tape. Sellers rarely warn buyers about legal requirements. Workers pay steep fees to keep earning and avoid losing their rides.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published February 21, 2024, details the surge in moped registrations among New York City delivery workers. DMV data show ZIP codes with many deliveristas now lead in registered mopeds. The article quotes workers like Junior Pichardo, who says, 'If you have plates, [the police] won’t summons you.' Eric Macario and William Medina, both delivery workers, highlight confusion and lack of information about registration and insurance. Medina blames sellers for failing to inform buyers. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores have introduced a bill to require sellers to register mopeds before sale, but it remains pending. For now, advocates help workers navigate the system. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project says many only learn the rules after police seize their mopeds or issue tickets. The crackdown exposes systemic gaps, leaving vulnerable workers to bear the cost and risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way. The bill targets that risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT described the meeting as a chance to 'help craft a proposal' and denied any plan to eliminate all parking. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We wanted to start here, in this pilot project, listening from the community on how we reimagine the community.' Residents, spurred by misinformation, confronted officials and voiced fears over losing parking. Some, like Andy Rosenthal, supported loading zones. Others, like activist Andrew Fine, rejected the process outright.

Vendors, many disabled or veterans, say the ban guts their livelihoods overnight.</p><p class=mb3>On January 2, 2024, City Hall announced a blanket ban on street vendors from city bridges, effective January 3. The policy, not a council bill but a mayoral action, follows months of warnings and public debate. Mayor Adams said, "Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety." The Department of Transportation cited overcrowding and safety risks on the Brooklyn Bridge, where daily pedestrian numbers have doubled since 2021. Vendors and advocates, including Mohamed Attia of the Street Vendor Project, condemned the ban for stripping workers—many disabled or veterans—of income with no safety net. Upper West Side Council Member Gale Brewer proposed a compromise bill to allow regulated vending on wider bridge sections, but the administration pushed ahead with a total ban. The city claims the measure will protect pedestrians, but offers no new space or support for displaced vendors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, introduced April 11, 2023, and filed December 31, 2023, calls for 'allowing New York City to establish a lower speed limit, and enacting a crash victims bill of rights.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif led sponsorship, joined by Gutiérrez, Restler, and others. The package aims to cut speeds, redesign streets, and support crash victims. It would let the city set safer limits, require safe passing for cyclists, and mandate complete street design. The council’s action spotlights the urgent need to protect people walking, biking, and riding in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
