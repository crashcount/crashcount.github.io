Four seriously hurt.</strong> In the past year, 290 crashes tore through Upper West Side (Central). The dead: a 69-year-old woman, a 75-year-old man, a 55-year-old neighbor. The injured: children, elders, cyclists, walkers. The numbers do not flinch—<strong>134 injured, 4 left with wounds that will not heal</strong>.</p><p>A left turn, a crosswalk, a moment. Miriam Reinharth, 69, was crossing Amsterdam at 96th. An ambulance turned left. She died in the hospital. Her husband remembers her smile as they wheeled her away. &ldquo;The police officer said the accident was not Miriam&rsquo;s fault at all&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight?</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians here in the last three years.</strong> Cars and trucks did the rest. Bikes and mopeds injured, but they did not kill. The street is a gauntlet. A man crossing Broadway at dawn. A cyclist clipped by a turning truck. A child struck on the way to school. Each crash is a family broken, a name erased from the block.</p><p>Darnell Sealy-McCrorey stands with other families. He says, &ldquo;This epidemic is preventable. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>City leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new speed cameras, lower limits, intersection redesigns. But the deaths keep coming. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it. Cameras that catch speeders may go dark if Albany does not act. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The council debates e-bike rules while the real killers—cars and trucks—roll on.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets where a child can cross and come home. The dead cannot speak. You must. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Its matter title reads: 'Requires the consideration of complete street design for certain transportation projects which receive federal or state funding.' Didi Barrett leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Amy Paulin, Carrie Woerner, and many others as co-sponsors. The bill compels agencies to consider complete street design—meaning streets built for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users, not just drivers. It also requires the department to publish guidance and reference materials for public use. This measure, if enforced, could reshape how New York builds and rebuilds its roads, putting vulnerable road users at the center of every project.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous. Lawmakers are under pressure to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, has stalled in the legislature before. Hochul’s State of the State address declared, 'she will introduce her own version of the existing "Sammy's Law" bill.' Hoylman-Sigal called City Council members his 'partners' and urged their support. Amy Cohen, whose son was killed by a speeding driver, pressed the Council to act, saying, 'We need the Council to make it a priority to support Sammy's Law and redesign streets ... at a safe speed limit.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone added, 'DOT strongly supports Sammy’s Law.' The Adams administration and street safety advocates back the measure. If passed, the law would let the city drop speed limits below 25 mph citywide and below 15 mph near schools, giving local officials real power to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states: 'Noise complaints from helicopters over New York City have soared in recent years, but lawmakers at city, state, and federal levels have failed to significantly reduce non-essential helicopter flights.' Restler declared, 'This isn't just a quality of life issue — it's about climate justice. 1 helicopter idling is the equivalent of 40 cars!' Council Member Gale Brewer and State Senator Brad Hoylman joined calls for action. Despite advocacy and testimony from residents, significant policy changes have not passed.

Noise and fumes choke neighborhoods. Lawmakers cite climate justice, but federal rules block action. Complaints soar. The city’s deal fails. Residents and activists demand relief. The sky remains loud.</p><p class=mb3>"We’re not a bunch of zoo animals in New York City to be viewed by tourists flying overhead." -- Brad Hoylman-Sigal</p><p class=mb3>On December 12, 2022, the New York City Council, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, introduced a bill to ban non-essential helicopter flights from city heliports. The bill, discussed in oversight hearings, remains stalled. The matter summary states: 'Noise complaints from helicopters over New York City have soared in recent years, but lawmakers at city, state, and federal levels have failed to significantly reduce non-essential helicopter flights.' Restler declared, 'This isn't just a quality of life issue — it's about climate justice. 1 helicopter idling is the equivalent of 40 cars!' Council Member Gale Brewer and State Senator Brad Hoylman joined calls for action. Despite advocacy and testimony from residents, significant policy changes have not passed. The Federal Aviation Administration’s authority blocks local control. Helicopter noise and pollution continue to harm New Yorkers, especially in vulnerable neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates warn more deliveries mean more danger. They demand protected bike lanes and charging stations. Without safe streets, low-income workers face traffic violence and crime. The fight for safety continues.</p><p class=mb3>On November 23, 2022, a new city report recommended a significant pay raise for New York’s 65,000 app-based delivery workers. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection projects a 35% jump in deliveries by 2025, raising safety concerns. The report summary states, 'the number of deliveries made per hour will increase, leading to more delivery workers on city streets.' Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project and Council Member Gale Brewer both called for more protected bike lanes, higher expense rates, and better charging infrastructure. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives said, 'Workers have the right to a safe workplace: for our city's delivery workers, this means a network of safe, protected bike lanes that help prevent crashes.' Advocates insist a wage hike alone is not enough. They demand the city build out infrastructure to protect workers from traffic violence and hazardous conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'More Money for Delivery Workers Will Require More Protection for Them,' highlights a proposed minimum wage of $23.82 per hour for app-based delivery workers, up from $7.09. Council Member Gale A. Brewer (District 6) voiced support for a $5 increase to cover work expenses, stating, 'I support increasing the expense rate in the rule by $5 to address these work tools.' The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection projects a 35% jump in deliveries by 2025. Advocates and workers say higher pay must come with more protected bike lanes and charging stations. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives said, 'Workers have the right to a safe workplace: for our city's delivery workers, this means a network of safe, protected bike lanes.'
