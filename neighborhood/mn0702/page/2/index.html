Four seriously hurt.</strong> In the past year, 290 crashes tore through Upper West Side (Central). The dead: a 69-year-old woman, a 75-year-old man, a 55-year-old neighbor. The injured: children, elders, cyclists, walkers. The numbers do not flinch—<strong>134 injured, 4 left with wounds that will not heal</strong>.</p><p>A left turn, a crosswalk, a moment. Miriam Reinharth, 69, was crossing Amsterdam at 96th. An ambulance turned left. She died in the hospital. Her husband remembers her smile as they wheeled her away. &ldquo;The police officer said the accident was not Miriam&rsquo;s fault at all&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight?</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians here in the last three years.</strong> Cars and trucks did the rest. Bikes and mopeds injured, but they did not kill. The street is a gauntlet. A man crossing Broadway at dawn. A cyclist clipped by a turning truck. A child struck on the way to school. Each crash is a family broken, a name erased from the block.</p><p>Darnell Sealy-McCrorey stands with other families. He says, &ldquo;This epidemic is preventable.

But the deaths keep coming. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it. Cameras that catch speeders may go dark if Albany does not act. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The council debates e-bike rules while the real killers—cars and trucks—roll on.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets where a child can cross and come home. The dead cannot speak. You must. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The rider was ejected from the vehicle and sustained abrasions and upper arm injuries, classified as injury severity level 3. The driver remained conscious after the crash. The report does not list any contributing factors for the crash, but the merging maneuver preceding the collision suggests driver error related to vehicle positioning or failure to yield. No factors related to the victim's actions were cited.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

A Ford sedan, traveling northeast and making a right turn, struck a 23-year-old male bicyclist going straight ahead. The bicyclist, who was helmeted, was partially ejected and sustained abrasions and injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot. The report cites driver errors including unsafe lane changing and improper passing or lane usage as contributing factors. Additionally, the bicyclist's own confusion or error is noted but does not mitigate the driver’s failure to maintain safe control. The sedan’s center front end was the point of impact, indicating a direct collision. The driver was licensed, but the bicyclist was unlicensed.
