Since 2022, <strong>three people have died and 631 have been injured</strong> in crashes here. Eight of those injuries were serious. The numbers do not tell you about the silence after the sirens fade. They do not show you the blood on the crosswalk or the shoes left behind.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm.</strong> They killed one person and injured over eighty more. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the count. The dead and wounded are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, workers, elders.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not stop. In the last year alone, <strong>one person died and 199 were injured</strong> in 318 crashes. A 45-year-old woman was killed crossing at 158th Street and 111th Avenue by an SUV. The cause: driver inattention. She died at the intersection, her life ended by a moment’s distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 50-year-old cyclist was crushed by a sedan on Liberty Avenue.

She co-sponsored bills for better lighting, safer crossings, and more reporting on police vehicle crashes (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>File Int 0079-2024</a>). But too many bills sit stalled in committee. Promises wait in the dark while people die in the street.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. <strong>Call your council member. Demand real change.</strong> Demand slower speeds, safer crossings, and streets built for people, not just cars. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Sponsored by Queens Councilman Robert Holden, the bill sits in the health committee, chaired by Lynn Schulman. Speaker Adrienne Adams has not stated her position. The bill, described as a push to end the city’s carriage industry, gained attention after the death of a horse named Lady. Animal rights groups rallied, warning, 'Without a ban there will be more crashes in traffic, there will be more injuries and possibly deaths.' TWU Local 100 opposes the ban. Safety analysts note that removing carriages would cut unpredictable, slow vehicles from streets, reducing crash risk and making roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary: 'the NYC Council approved on Monday a pay increase for app-based grocery-delivery workers.' Speaker Adrienne Adams and Justin Brannan backed higher EMT pay, but the bill leaves FDNY EMTs earning less than delivery workers. Safety analysts found no direct impact on pedestrians or cyclists: 'The pay increase for app-based delivery workers does not directly affect the safety of pedestrians or cyclists, nor does it impact street design, mode shift, or driver accountability.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing spiraled into calls for licensing. Riders and advocates warned: this won’t make streets safer. Focus drifted from real threats. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On July 15, 2025, City Hall held a public hearing on Mayor Adams’s proposed 15 mph e-bike speed limit. The session, covered by Kevin Duggan, quickly shifted to e-bike licensing and registration. The matter, described as 'a public hearing about the mayor's proposed speed limit devolved into a debate about e-bike licensing,' saw no council member take a clear stance. Advocates warned that focusing on licensing distracts from proven safety measures and burdens vulnerable users. The safety analyst noted this shift risks real harm, pulling attention from systemic fixes that protect walkers and riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
