A 45-year-old woman, killed crossing at 158th Street and 111th Avenue. A 62-year-old man, struck down on Linden Boulevard, cane in hand, trying to get home. His family grieves.

Police allege Peña was 'drunk and high on cocaine and marijuana' and speeding at 83 mph when he 'ran a red light and T-boned a car driven by 24-year-old Justin Diaz.' The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions. Peña faces manslaughter and other charges, with a possible 15-year sentence if convicted. The case highlights the lethal risk of impaired, reckless driving and the limits of pretrial detention policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, the City Council debated a new bill to bring back year-round roadway dining. The measure, still in committee, follows the 2023 law that limited outdoor dining to April through November. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) leads the charge, calling the current law a 'failure' that 'prioritized parking spots over vibrant streets.' Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Lawmakers and advocates agree: high costs, bureaucracy, and seasonality block participation and hurt street life.

Prosecutors allege Peña was drunk, high, and speeding at 83 mph—three times the limit—when he ran a red light and T-boned 23-year-old Justin Diaz’s car. Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield. The victim, Diaz, was headed to work and had just graduated college. The case highlights repeated driver violations and systemic failures in enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both bills require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create public trackers for capital projects tied to the Streets Master Plan. Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.

Volunteers warn more cuts loom unless City Hall steps up. Federal relief is gone. Groups want $48 million over three years. Current grants barely keep programs alive. The city’s inaction puts public space and safety at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2025, a coalition of 16 volunteer open street groups sent a letter to City Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers. They warned, 'The limited funding and decreases in funding that have occurred over the years jeopardize the continuity and future of the program—funding pressure is already leading to downsizing and the disappearance of Open Streets programs.' The groups seek $48 million over three years, separate from the city’s $30 million contract with the Horticultural Society. Current grants max out at $20,000 per year, forcing cutbacks. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams are starting budget talks. Council spokesperson Julia Agos called Open Streets 'critical components of our city's public realm.' The Department of Transportation said suggestions will be reviewed. Volunteer groups handle most operations, but stalled redesigns and lack of resources threaten the program’s survival.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
