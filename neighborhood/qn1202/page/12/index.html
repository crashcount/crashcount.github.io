A 45-year-old woman, killed crossing at 158th Street and 111th Avenue. A 62-year-old man, struck down on Linden Boulevard, cane in hand, trying to get home. His family grieves.

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, expected before lawmakers next month, keeps sidewalk dining year-round but limits curbside 'streeteries' to warmer months.

Council Member Marjorie Velázquez’s original bill would have shifted control to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans argue, 'A year-round option is an absolute must.' The bill responds to complaints about noise, rats, and lost parking, but also credits the program with saving 100,000 jobs.

The bill, led by Council Member Marjorie Velázquez, remains under negotiation. Speaker Adrienne Adams, speaking at a Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce event, said, "We're almost there, so we've got high hopes for something happening very very soon." The bill proposes shifting oversight from the Department of Transportation to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection and making the program seasonal. Mayor Adams wants DOT to keep control. Speaker Adams and most council members support continuing outdoor dining, but opponents cite noise, garbage, and parking loss. The program expanded rapidly during the pandemic, especially in working-class neighborhoods of color. Advocates push for affordable, flexible setups and citywide standards. The council seeks a balance between business and neighborhood needs.

The bill aimed to amend city law to require the Department of Transportation to finish all street resurfacing work within two weeks. If more time was needed, the department would have to notify the community, stating the reason and new timeline. The matter summary reads: 'ensure that all work associated with the resurfacing of any street is finalized within 2 weeks from the start of work.' Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by thirty other members. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst reviewed the impact, but torn-up streets are a known threat to pedestrians and cyclists. The bill is dead.

Adams stated, 'The increase in traffic fatalities since 2018 is alarming, particularly the rise in children killed by traffic violence.' The report highlights that the city is not on pace to meet the 2019 Streets Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of bus lanes in five years. Disparities in hit-and-run arrests remain stark between white neighborhoods and neighborhoods of color.

The program, debated in the Council and championed by Speaker Adrienne Adams, brought outdoor dining to 17 community boards previously shut out by high fees and red tape.

Brooklyn’s share of outdoor dining rose from 16% to 25%, while Manhattan’s dropped from 70% to 49%. Queens and the Bronx doubled their share. Speaker Adams opposes dining sheds in the roadway and seeks to shift oversight from DOT to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Advocates warn DCWP lacks resources and fear a return to restrictive rules. DOT supports keeping the process simple and affordable, citing equity and vibrant streets.

Adams’s stance on parking signals a preference for car storage over expanded public space, a move that can limit safety gains for pedestrians and cyclists. The review underscores a year of mixed progress: new safety measures, but persistent threats for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
