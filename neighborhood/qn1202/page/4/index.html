A 45-year-old woman, killed crossing at 158th Street and 111th Avenue. A 62-year-old man, struck down on Linden Boulevard, cane in hand, trying to get home. His family grieves.

Governor Kathy Hochul signed this and other safety bills into law. Charter bus passengers ages 8 to 16 must now wear seatbelts, a response to a fatal crash in Orange County.

The bill, debated on December 10, 2024, is backed by Council Member Bob Holden and mentioned by Chi Ossé of District 36. The matter summary states: 'A majority of NYC Council members support Intro 606, a bill requiring all e-bikes to be registered with the Department of Transportation and issued license plates.' Speaker Adrienne Adams voiced concern for immigrant communities but did not address the bill's direct impact. Council Member Vickie Paladino dismissed profiling worries, focusing instead on crime. Advocates and experts warn the bill could lead to discriminatory enforcement against immigrant delivery workers, exposing them to policing and immigration risks. Data shows e-bikes cause a tiny fraction of road deaths, while car drivers remain the main threat. The bill, critics say, misses the real danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not taken a public stance. Conservative members like Bob Holden oppose the plan, while City Planning Commission Chairman Dan Garodnick urges action: 'Your district needs to be part of the housing solution.'
