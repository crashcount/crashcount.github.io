A 45-year-old woman, killed crossing at 158th Street and 111th Avenue. A 62-year-old man, struck down on Linden Boulevard, cane in hand, trying to get home. His family grieves.

She cites blocked sidewalks and safety fears. Riders and advocates push back, warning a pause will hurt those who rely on scooters for safe, cheap travel.</p><p class=mb3>On October 10, 2024, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams called for an 'immediate operational pause' of the e-scooter share program in eastern Queens. The matter, described as a demand to 'pause' the program due to 'sidewalks allegedly rendered impassible by the micromobility devices,' reflects Adams's concerns about scooters left on sidewalks and streets. She stated, 'My constituents have consistently raised questions and concerns about the safety hazards created when e-scooters are frequently left on sidewalks and streets, obstructing pedestrians and all road users.' Adams's stance opposes the current e-scooter share and expansion of micromobility options, but supports stronger regulation and enforcement. The Department of Transportation and advocates highlight the program's success, with nearly 500,000 trips since launch, and argue for better infrastructure instead of a ban. No formal council vote has occurred; this is a public demand from the Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s most vulnerable lost ground. Adams called crashes accidents. The toll mounts.</p><p class=mb3>This analysis reviews Mayor Eric Adams’s record on livable streets as of September 27, 2024. The piece, published by Streetsblog NYC, scrutinizes Adams’s actions and inactions: 'Adams repeatedly failed to meet annual requirements to add new miles of protected bus and bike lanes under the 2019 Streets Master Plan, despite vowing to exceed those benchmarks while campaigning.' Adams supported removing parking mandates through the City of Yes initiative and expanded daylighting at intersections, but fell short on bike and bus lane expansion. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams threatened legal action over unmet safety mandates. Adams’s administration enabled donor-driven sabotage of safety projects, watered down road diets, and ignored placard abuse. His DOT advanced the BQE rebuild against local opposition. Adams’s rhetoric blamed victims and minimized systemic danger. The result: vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—face greater risk. Promises to reclaim streets for people remain largely unfulfilled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
