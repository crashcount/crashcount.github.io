Since 2022, <strong>three people have died and 631 have been injured</strong> in crashes here. Eight of those injuries were serious. The numbers do not tell you about the silence after the sirens fade. They do not show you the blood on the crosswalk or the shoes left behind.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm.</strong> They killed one person and injured over eighty more.

He slammed into Justin Diaz’s car. Diaz died. He was 23. His family buried him with his new degree. The firefighter faces charges. The street remains unchanged.</p><p class=mb3>According to the NY Daily News (2025-03-04), Justin Diaz, 23, was killed when an off-duty FDNY firefighter, Michael Pena, sped through a red light at 83 mph in a 25 mph zone and struck Diaz’s BMW at 107th St. and Northern Blvd. Diaz was heading to work at LaGuardia Airport. Prosecutors say Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and refused a breath test. His blood-alcohol content was 0.156 percent. Surveillance footage confirmed Diaz had the right-of-way. The article notes, 'The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light, prosecutors say.' Pena was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. His license was suspended. The case highlights ongoing dangers for New York City road users and questions about bail and accountability for reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
