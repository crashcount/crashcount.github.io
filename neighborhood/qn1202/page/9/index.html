A 45-year-old woman, killed crossing at 158th Street and 111th Avenue. A 62-year-old man, struck down on Linden Boulevard, cane in hand, trying to get home. His family grieves.

Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in South Jamaica, the pace is slow. The wide roads stay wide. The cameras are few. The deaths keep coming. One life lost is too many, but the work is unfinished.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people on foot and bike. Flood the dangerous streets with cameras that never blink. Call your council member. Demand action. Don’t wait for another family to lose someone. The city has the tools. It needs the will.</p><p>Act now. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The move shifted Restler, known for championing safe streets, to chair the Governmental Operations, State and Federal Legislation Committee. The matter summary notes Restler's intent to remain active: 'I am reintroducing 501, the citizen reporting bill, and will push as hard as I can to get it over the finish line.' Restler has sponsored bills to curb illegal parking, speed up bike lane installations, and fight placard abuse. Despite his removal, advocates and colleagues, including Jon Orcutt, voiced confidence that Restler will continue to fight for pedestrian and cyclist safety. The committee change may slow progress on key safety bills, but Restler's record and resolve remain strong.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, under review since 2020, aims to boost 10-minute-or-better service for 200,000 more residents, raising coverage from 60.1% to 68.9%. The official summary states the redesign will 'streamline and speed up service.' Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers voiced 'serious concerns' about disadvantages for her district, especially with congestion pricing. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, once critical, now supports the draft after public outreach. State Senator Leroy Comrie noted Brooks-Powers wants clarity for her community, not outright rejection. The redesign awaits further input and is expected no sooner than 2025.

No more big rigs clogging residential blocks. By 2025, each borough must have a site. The city must act or explain delays. Streets may breathe. Danger shifts from curbs.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0906-2023, now Local Law 142 of 2023, was enacted by the City Council on October 29, 2023, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill’s title: 'A Local Law in relation to parking for tractor trailers and other commercial trucks.' It requires the city to identify at least one feasible off-street parking location for tractor trailers in each borough by the end of 2023, and to establish those sites by December 31, 2025. No location can be on a residential street. Council Member Kamillah Hanks sponsored the bill, joined by Brannan, Riley, Dinowitz, Ung, Brooks-Powers, and others. The law aims to clear residential streets of oversized trucks, shifting their presence to designated lots. The council’s action targets the chronic hazard of trucks parked where people walk, bike, and live.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
