In the last year alone, <strong>one person died and 199 were injured</strong> in 318 crashes. A 45-year-old woman was killed crossing at 158th Street and 111th Avenue by an SUV.

Governor Kathy Hochul signed this and other safety bills into law. Charter bus passengers ages 8 to 16 must now wear seatbelts, a response to a fatal crash in Orange County.
