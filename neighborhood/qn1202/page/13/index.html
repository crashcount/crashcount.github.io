A 45-year-old woman, killed crossing at 158th Street and 111th Avenue. A 62-year-old man, struck down on Linden Boulevard, cane in hand, trying to get home. His family grieves.

Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation.

Rodriguez supports curbside dining, declaring, 'the future of New York City is going car free.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams disagrees, saying outdoor dining should stay on the sidewalk. Mayor Adams promises to keep the program as a 'critical driver of recovery.' The report found more business growth on open streets than on similar corridors, with gains in Astoria, Prospect Heights, and Chinatown.

The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On October 20, 2022, Mayor Adams called on the City Council to keep the Department of Transportation (DOT) in charge of the Open Restaurants program. The current council bill would transfer oversight to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) and restrict roadway dining to warmer months. The matter, described as 'Mayor Adams: Keep DOT in Charge of Open Restaurants,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Marjorie Velázquez sponsors the bill but declined comment. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams voiced mixed feelings, praising outdoor dining but worrying about city character. Advocates and former officials warn DCWP lacks the budget, staff, and expertise. DOT has managed the program since its pandemic start, expanding it to 13,000 eateries. Supporters say DOT’s experience is vital for public space and safety. The program’s fate hangs in legislative limbo.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
