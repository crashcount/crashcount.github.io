A 45-year-old woman, killed crossing at 158th Street and 111th Avenue. A 62-year-old man, struck down on Linden Boulevard, cane in hand, trying to get home. His family grieves.

Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in South Jamaica, the pace is slow. The wide roads stay wide. The cameras are few. The deaths keep coming. One life lost is too many, but the work is unfinished.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people on foot and bike. Flood the dangerous streets with cameras that never blink. Call your council member. Demand action. Don’t wait for another family to lose someone. The city has the tools. It needs the will.</p><p>Act now.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted the proposal's promise: 'both new train service and park land.' State Sen. James Sanders led the call, declaring, 'Yes, we want a park and yes we want a light rail. We can have both.' Mike Scala, another advocate, stressed public support for a combined approach. The QueensLink faces competition from the QueensWay, a park-only plan with $35 million in city funding. The MTA has not committed, citing high costs and ongoing needs assessment. No formal council bill or committee action is recorded yet. Supporters remain determined to see transit, park space, and bike paths included in future city plans.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets shift, but cars still win cold months.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2023, the New York City Council passed a bill to make outdoor dining permanent, but with limits. The measure, approved 34-11, moves through the Council and awaits Mayor Adams’s signature. The bill states: 'curbside set-ups were designed to be temporary and should not be in the permanent program.' Council Member Marjorie Velázquez, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'We want to strike a chord and a balance and this is it.' Speaker Adrienne Adams backed the winter pause. Council Member Chi Ossé voted yes, but noted hardship for small businesses. The law allows sidewalk seating all year, but curbside dining only from April to November. Fees apply, and old sheds must go by November 2024. The Department of Transportation will set design rules. Advocates call the bill historic but incomplete, as curb space returns to cars in winter, limiting gains for people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law requires the Department of Transportation to publish a monthly-updated, searchable map of all city bike lanes. The map must show obstructions, construction, crash patterns, shared paths, conflict points, resurfacing, parking, bike share docks, open streets, repair shops, and reporting tools. The bill’s matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to develop a map of bicycle infrastructure conditions.' Council Member Crystal Hudson sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Sanchez, Stevens, Yeger, Restler, Avilés, and others. The law brings sunlight to hidden hazards, giving vulnerable road users the facts they need to see the city’s dangers in plain sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, led by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, is a required step before state passage. Brooks-Powers had withheld support until the bill included street redesigns for safety, especially in low-income communities of color. She said, 'Lowering speed limits works best when paired with traffic calming and street safety infrastructure.' The resolution now has 23 co-sponsors, three short of a majority. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver. Last year, the Council failed to pass a home rule message under Speaker Adams.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Elected officials say the move closes a transit gap. Riders in Rockaway face long commutes. The pilot brings cheaper, faster access. Some ticket purchase restrictions remain.</p><p class=mb3>On May 5, 2023, the MTA announced it will expand the $5 City Ticket fare to Far Rockaway LIRR riders. This policy, supported by Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, State Senator James Sanders, Jr., Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson, and City Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, addresses a long-standing exclusion in the city's transit network. The City Ticket allows travel within city limits on LIRR or Metro-North for $5 during off-peak and weekend hours. Richards called the move a win for 'transit equity.' Anderson highlighted that Rockaway has the city's longest commutes, and this change will help. Brooks-Powers urged further expansion and easier transfers. The pilot, part of upcoming fare changes, still restricts where tickets can be bought, a flaw officials promise to address. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
