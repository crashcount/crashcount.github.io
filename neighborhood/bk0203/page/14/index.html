She is struck and killed before she reaches the curb. The drivers stay. The street does not. In the last twelve months, one person died and another was seriously injured in Fort Greene. Fifty people have been hurt so far this year. The numbers are smaller than the pain. Each crash leaves a mark. Each injury is a life changed.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unending-risk>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unending Risk</h3><p>Cars and SUVs cause the most harm. In the past three years, they have been involved in at least 25 pedestrian injuries, including one serious. Trucks and buses add to the count. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the weight of steel does most of the damage. The streets are not safe for the old or the young. Ten children were hurt in the last year. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. Cameras catch speeders. Limits drop to 20 mph in some places. But the blood on the street dries slow. No new laws or redesigns have come from Fort Greene’s leaders in the last year. The silence is loud. The city says, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The dead do not answer.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Lower the speed. Harden the crosswalks. Build what works. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand cameras that never sleep.

The Adams administration cut short a protected bike lane on Ashland Place and may roll back other safety projects. At a town hall, Hudson called herself a neutral arbiter, saying, 'My record of supporting and delivering tangible results that make our streets safer and more accessible to cyclists, pedestrians, and all New Yorkers speaks for itself.' She criticized city outreach but did not commit to defending threatened projects. Hudson has co-sponsored Int. 965 for protected bike lanes and funded safety on Flatbush Avenue and Vanderbilt Avenue Open Streets. Still, advocates and residents launched a petition, demanding she take a clear stand. Hudson’s legislative record shows support, but her neutrality leaves vulnerable road users exposed as projects hang in the balance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) ended contractor support in spring 2023, citing a shift of resources to higher-need areas and the street's ineligibility for the Public Space Equity Program. The matter summary states, 'A block-long "open street"...ended in spring 2023 after the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) reassigned its contractor elsewhere.' Council Member Crystal Hudson did not comment on the closure. Volunteers, including Phillip Kellogg, Brian Blessinger, and Mike Lydon, voiced frustration and burnout, highlighting the failure of relying on unpaid labor for public safety. No significant local opposition existed. The loss underscores the need for permanent city-backed programs to protect vulnerable road users and maintain safe, car-free spaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded.

The bill required drivers with 15 speed-camera or five red-light tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. Council Member Shahana Hanif voiced disappointment, noting, 'We need to not only reauthorize this program, but strengthen it.' Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data.

Gounardes, who fought for MTA funding in Albany, accused the agency of misrepresenting the improvements, saying, 'I’m shocked and frustrated that the MTA would misrepresent these service upgrades to the riding public.'

Hudson stated, 'the community surrounding Atlantic Avenue has called for a new vision for this dangerous corridor.' The plan identifies needs like bike boulevards, raised crosswalks, and wider sidewalks. However, the Department of Transportation raised concerns about protected bike lanes due to truck traffic.

Despite calls from Restler and other local officials for mid-block crossings and traffic calming after previous deaths, the city has not acted. The bill or action is a public statement, not legislation, but it highlights urgent demands for redesign and enforcement to protect vulnerable road users. No safety improvements have been implemented yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

An 18-year-old woman died after a driver sped through a red light and struck another car. Restler stated, 'This is one of the most dangerous strips in Brooklyn & we need safety improvements on Atlantic Ave NOW.' He called for immediate action: slower traffic, mid-block crossings, and better protections for all. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes echoed the demand for accountability and urgent fixes. No council bill is attached, but Restler’s public statement highlights the deadly pattern on Atlantic Avenue and the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The block near Two Trees’ garage sits unfinished. DOT staff fume. Protected lanes for cyclists and pedestrians wait. Private interests win. Vulnerable road users lose. The city’s promise stalls.</p><p class=mb3>On August 14, 2023, City Hall intervened in a Department of Transportation (DOT) street redesign, delaying protected bike lanes on Ashland Place and Navy Street in Brooklyn. The project, planned for over a year, aimed to add two-way protected bike lanes and convert some blocks to one-way for cars. According to Streetsblog, 'Officials from the Adams administration have held up part of yet another long-planned street redesign at the behest of a major local business opposed to part of the plan.' Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a top aide to Mayor Adams, reportedly ordered DOT to halt work after Two Trees Management, a powerful real estate company, lobbied against changes near its parking garage. Council member Crystal Hudson did not comment. DOT staff expressed frustration, saying such interference blocks progress for pedestrians and cyclists. The block near Two Trees remains without new markings, while other blocks move ahead.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
