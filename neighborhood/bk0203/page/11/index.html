She is struck and killed before she reaches the curb. The drivers stay. The street does not. In the last twelve months, one person died and another was seriously injured in Fort Greene. Fifty people have been hurt so far this year. The numbers are smaller than the pain. Each crash leaves a mark. Each injury is a life changed.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unending-risk>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unending Risk</h3><p>Cars and SUVs cause the most harm. In the past three years, they have been involved in at least 25 pedestrian injuries, including one serious. Trucks and buses add to the count. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the weight of steel does most of the damage. The streets are not safe for the old or the young. Ten children were hurt in the last year. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. Cameras catch speeders. Limits drop to 20 mph in some places. But the blood on the street dries slow. No new laws or redesigns have come from Fort Greene’s leaders in the last year. The silence is loud.

The dead do not answer.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Lower the speed. Harden the crosswalks. Build what works. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Hanif, Hudson, and Menin push for concrete change. The bill’s language is blunt: visibility saves lives. City agencies must oversee and evaluate.

New bill would force all new and replacement streetlights to shine no harsher than 3000 Kelvin. Cooler, softer light. A step to cut harsh beams on streets, parks, and sidewalks. Still stuck in committee.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0145-2024 was introduced on February 28, 2024, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee' as of January 21, 2025. The measure states: 'Any lamp to be used in the illumination of streets, highways, parks, or any other public place shall have a correlated color temperature no higher than 3000 Kelvin.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Chris Banks, and Crystal Hudson, along with the Queens Borough President, back the bill. Their action aims to limit the harsh blue-white glare from new and replacement streetlights across the city. The bill’s progress is stalled, but its intent is clear: soften city light, reduce visual strain, and make public spaces less hostile for those on foot or bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes orders New York to cut driving by 20 percent by 2050. Fewer cars, fewer deaths. The plan would save nearly 600 lives a year from crashes. Active travel rises. Streets grow safer. Pollution drops. Wallets breathe easier.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill S1981A, proposed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, demands a 20-percent reduction in vehicle miles traveled statewide by 2050. The bill, backed by New Yorkers for Transportation Equity, was introduced last year and is under consideration. The measure’s summary promises to 'improve air quality and reduce fatal crashes.' Gounardes, representing Brooklyn’s western edge, champions the shift: 'A new approach will not only protect our climate, but also make New York a safer, more affordable place to live.' Analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute projects 593 fewer traffic deaths each year, with thousands more lives saved through active transportation. The bill’s focus is clear: less driving, more safety, cleaner air, and real savings for families.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
