She is struck and killed before she reaches the curb. The drivers stay. The street does not. In the last twelve months, one person died and another was seriously injured in Fort Greene. Fifty people have been hurt so far this year. The numbers are smaller than the pain. Each crash leaves a mark. Each injury is a life changed.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unending-risk>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unending Risk</h3><p>Cars and SUVs cause the most harm. In the past three years, they have been involved in at least 25 pedestrian injuries, including one serious. Trucks and buses add to the count. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the weight of steel does most of the damage. The streets are not safe for the old or the young. Ten children were hurt in the last year. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. Cameras catch speeders. Limits drop to 20 mph in some places. But the blood on the street dries slow. No new laws or redesigns have come from Fort Greene’s leaders in the last year. The silence is loud. The city says, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The dead do not answer.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Lower the speed. Harden the crosswalks. Build what works. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists keep dying.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee considered S533, a bill to repeal congestion pricing, after a procedural motion by Sen. Jack Martins. Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets. Cyclist deaths keep rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure now returns to the City Planning Commission before a full Council vote. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue rezoning allowing 4,600 new homes passes key NYC Council panels,' covers a 20-block stretch in Crown Heights, Bed-Stuy, and Prospect Heights. Councilmembers Chi Ossé (District 36) and Crystal Hudson support the plan, which includes $215 million for infrastructure, tenant protections, and workforce development. Ossé said, 'We are taking on that challenge' of housing scarcity. The plan funds a comprehensive redesign of Atlantic Avenue, focusing on major intersections and bike infrastructure, plus upgrades to playgrounds and subway access. These changes target systemic street danger, aiming to protect pedestrians and cyclists in a corridor long plagued by crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety for cyclists erodes.</p><p class=mb3>On May 5, 2025, Streetsblog NYC, led by reporter David Meyer, exposed a new NYPD enforcement policy criminalizing common cycling violations. The article, 'Monday’s Headlines: NYPD Bike Crackdown Edition,' revealed that the crackdown would sweep 14 corridors across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the policy 'incredibly misguided' and 'unacceptable.' MSNBC’s Chris Hayes called it 'outrageous' and warned it targets immigrant delivery cyclists. The New York Civil Liberties Union warned of amplified racially targeted policing. The safety analyst notes: 'Criminalizing common cycling violations places undue burdens on cyclists, discourages cycling, and may reduce mode shift, ultimately undermining safety in numbers and street equity for vulnerable road users.' No council bill or committee action is involved, but the crackdown stands as a systemic threat to cyclists and street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
