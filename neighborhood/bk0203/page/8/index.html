Since 2022, three people have died here in crashes. Seven more were left with injuries so grave they will not forget them. In the last twelve months alone, 158 neighbors were hurt, two of them seriously. One did not survive. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people who walked out the door and did not come home.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs hit hardest.</strong> They caused 80 pedestrian injuries—more than bikes, mopeds, or trucks combined. The wounds are not just bruises. They are broken bones, bleeding heads, and lives cut short.</p><h3 id=recent-wounds-fresh-pain><strong>Recent Wounds, Fresh Pain</strong></h3><p>On June 23, a woman crossing at Lafayette and Flatbush was struck by an SUV. She was left bleeding from the head, in shock, her view blocked, her body broken. The police report says she was crossing against the signal. The SUV kept going straight. The street did not care (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A year earlier, a moped rider was thrown from his seat at Carlton and Lafayette. He hit the pavement face-first, bleeding, incoherent. The cause: driver inattention (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done><strong>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</strong></h3><p>The city has started to act. Speed cameras now watch the streets day and night. Local leaders like Senator Jabari Brisport <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on bills</a> to extend school speed zones and to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The carnage continues. The cameras catch the reckless, but the reckless keep driving. The bills pass, but the bodies keep falling.</p><h3 id=no-more-waiting><strong>No More Waiting</strong></h3><p><strong>Every delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them: Lower the speed limit. Enforce the laws. Build streets for people, not for cars. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The moped sustained no damage, and the driver was not ejected and remained conscious. The report does not list any contributing factors related to the victim's behavior or safety equipment beyond helmet use, which was noted but not cited as a factor. This crash underscores the dangers posed by unsafe vehicle maneuvers in Brooklyn traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
