She is struck and killed before she reaches the curb. The drivers stay. The street does not. In the last twelve months, one person died and another was seriously injured in Fort Greene. Fifty people have been hurt so far this year. The numbers are smaller than the pain. Each crash leaves a mark. Each injury is a life changed.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unending-risk>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unending Risk</h3><p>Cars and SUVs cause the most harm. In the past three years, they have been involved in at least 25 pedestrian injuries, including one serious. Trucks and buses add to the count. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the weight of steel does most of the damage. The streets are not safe for the old or the young. Ten children were hurt in the last year. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. Cameras catch speeders. Limits drop to 20 mph in some places. But the blood on the street dries slow. No new laws or redesigns have come from Fort Greene’s leaders in the last year. The silence is loud. The city says, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The dead do not answer.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Lower the speed. Harden the crosswalks. Build what works. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>Bill to reduce vehicle miles traveled by 20 percent by 2050, introduced by State Senator Andrew Gounardes (District 26), is backed by advocates and the New Yorkers for Transportation Equity coalition. Announced February 6, 2024, the bill would require transportation officials to align projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes said, "We fundamentally want to be shifting how we think about transportation infrastructure." The measure responds to data showing over 90 percent of infrastructure funds go to roads, not transit. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance called for an "about-face," noting highway projects have torn apart poor communities and endangered pedestrians and cyclists. The bill sits before the state legislature. No direct safety analyst assessment, but advocates stress the law would shift funding from car-centric projects to transit and greenways, reducing systemic danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes pushes a bill to slash car trips by a fifth by 2050. Advocates say New York spends billions on roads while traffic deaths climb. The law would force highway projects to prove they cut driving, not fuel it.</p><p class=mb3>State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill requiring New York to reduce vehicle miles traveled by 20 percent by 2050. The bill, modeled after Minnesota law, is not yet passed or assigned to a committee. It would amend the state’s climate law, forcing transportation officials to align highway projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes warns, 'If we’re just going to use that money to double down on the transportation of the past, on just purely automobile usage, we’re making a great mistake.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit. The measure would require revisions or offsets for projects that don’t cut driving. Gov. Hochul’s office declined comment. The bill aims to halt the cycle of road expansion, rising traffic, and mounting deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act.

The measure stalled at session’s end.</p><p class=mb3>Res 0866-2023, filed by the Committee on Public Safety, called on Albany to pass S.2447/A.5234. The resolution, introduced December 20, 2023, and filed at session’s end, urged harsher penalties for purposefully obstructed license plates. The matter’s title: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S.2447/A.5234, which would increase the penalties for purposefully obstructed license plates.' Council Member Robert F. Holden sponsored the measure. The bill aimed to stop drivers from hiding plates to evade speed, red-light, and bus-lane cameras. Obstructed plates let dangerous drivers slip through enforcement, putting vulnerable road users at risk. The resolution supported stronger tools—confiscation, registration suspension, and blocking vehicle IDs—to crack down on this threat.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
