She is struck and killed before she reaches the curb. The drivers stay. The street does not. In the last twelve months, one person died and another was seriously injured in Fort Greene. Fifty people have been hurt so far this year. The numbers are smaller than the pain. Each crash leaves a mark. Each injury is a life changed.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unending-risk>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unending Risk</h3><p>Cars and SUVs cause the most harm. In the past three years, they have been involved in at least 25 pedestrian injuries, including one serious. Trucks and buses add to the count. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the weight of steel does most of the damage. The streets are not safe for the old or the young. Ten children were hurt in the last year. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. Cameras catch speeders. Limits drop to 20 mph in some places. But the blood on the street dries slow. No new laws or redesigns have come from Fort Greene’s leaders in the last year. The silence is loud. The city says, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The dead do not answer.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Lower the speed. Harden the crosswalks. Build what works. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Now, the city moves to put people before traffic.</p><p class=mb3>On July 26, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced major street safety upgrades for Atlantic Avenue in District 33. The project, led by NYC DOT, brings mid-block crossings, concrete pedestrian islands, curb enhancements, and split-phase signals to one of Brooklyn’s deadliest corridors. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push. Local officials and advocates say these changes mark a crucial step in ending the street’s legacy of danger and death.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority.

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.

Obscured tags let reckless motorists dodge cameras and tickets. The problem grows. Lawmakers want stiffer penalties to stop the evasion and protect people on city streets.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0467-2024 sits in the Committee on Public Safety. Introduced June 20, 2024, it urges Albany to pass S.2447/A.5234. The measure’s title: 'increase the penalties for purposefully obstructed license plates.' Council Members Justin L. Brannan (primary sponsor, District 47) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) lead the push. The bill targets drivers who cover or deface plates to evade speed, red-light, and bus-lane cameras. Data shows unreadable plates rose from 3.98% to 4.66% in one year. The city lost up to $38.7 million in unissued tickets between 2019 and 2022. The resolution calls for higher fines, confiscation of plate coverings, and registration suspensions. Lawmakers say this crackdown is needed to keep dangerous drivers from slipping through the cracks and to make streets safer for everyone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
