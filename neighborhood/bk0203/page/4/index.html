She is struck and killed before she reaches the curb. The drivers stay. The street does not. In the last twelve months, one person died and another was seriously injured in Fort Greene. Fifty people have been hurt so far this year. The numbers are smaller than the pain. Each crash leaves a mark. Each injury is a life changed.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unending-risk>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unending Risk</h3><p>Cars and SUVs cause the most harm. In the past three years, they have been involved in at least 25 pedestrian injuries, including one serious. Trucks and buses add to the count. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the weight of steel does most of the damage. The streets are not safe for the old or the young. Ten children were hurt in the last year. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. Cameras catch speeders. Limits drop to 20 mph in some places. But the blood on the street dries slow. No new laws or redesigns have come from Fort Greene’s leaders in the last year. The silence is loud. The city says, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The dead do not answer.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Lower the speed. Harden the crosswalks. Build what works. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Her car had 99 violations in a year, including 21 speeding and five red-light tickets. Advocates, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, blame Albany’s delay in passing Senator Andrew Gounardes’s bill to require speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders. Furnas said, “If Albany had passed this bill when it was first introduced, this vehicle would already have been speed limited and this crash would never have happened.” The bill remains pending.

"This means no new station elevators for elderly and disabled riders, and no new subway signals to speed up commutes for working New Yorkers."" -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration withdrew federal approval for New York City's congestion pricing program. U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy cited burdens on working-class drivers and questioned the legality of using toll revenue for transit. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit to challenge the move, arguing the program is settled law and already reduces congestion. State Senators Andrew Gounardes and Zellnor Myrie condemned the action, warning, 'Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system.' The withdrawal aligns with New Jersey's opposition and threatens transit upgrades like elevators for elderly and disabled riders. Local officials and advocates say ending congestion pricing will harm vulnerable road users and worsen street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas.
