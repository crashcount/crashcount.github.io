She is struck and killed before she reaches the curb. The drivers stay. The street does not. In the last twelve months, one person died and another was seriously injured in Fort Greene. Fifty people have been hurt so far this year. The numbers are smaller than the pain. Each crash leaves a mark. Each injury is a life changed.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unending-risk>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unending Risk</h3><p>Cars and SUVs cause the most harm. In the past three years, they have been involved in at least 25 pedestrian injuries, including one serious. Trucks and buses add to the count. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the weight of steel does most of the damage. The streets are not safe for the old or the young. Ten children were hurt in the last year. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. Cameras catch speeders. Limits drop to 20 mph in some places. But the blood on the street dries slow. No new laws or redesigns have come from Fort Greene’s leaders in the last year. The silence is loud.

The plan, conditionally endorsed by Community Boards 3 and 8, aims to create 4,600 apartments, protect manufacturing jobs, and improve street safety. The matter summary states the plan 'aims to bring nearly 4,600 new apartments, safeguard manufacturing space, and enhance pedestrian safety and infrastructure.' Hudson praised Borough President Reynoso’s recommendations, emphasizing 'strong manufacturing requirements, affordable housing, tenant protections, street safety, and workforce opportunities.' She called for a 'robust redesign of Atlantic Avenue that incorporates street safety improvements.' The plan includes a 'road diet' to reduce lanes, more metered parking, and safety upgrades at dangerous intersections. Residents and advocates raised concerns about displacement, legal protections, and infrastructure strain. The plan’s fate now rests with the city council and administration.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal includes traffic safety projects: planters, bike corrals, and daylighting—removing parking near intersections to clear sightlines.

Advocates want more.</p><p class=mb3>On January 29, 2025, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso pressed the Department of Transportation to overhaul a six-lane stretch of Atlantic Avenue as part of a rezoning plan. Reynoso’s recommendations—outlined in his official statement—include a road diet, pedestrian and cyclist upgrades, and paid parking. He criticized DOT’s lack of detail, saying, 'Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum.' The Atlantic Avenue Mixed Use Plan, now heading to a Department of City Planning hearing, would rezone 13 blocks and remove parking minimums for new housing. Council Member Crystal Hudson acknowledged the community’s demand for safety but stopped short of backing a road diet. DOT has promised some safety tweaks—painted neckdowns, daylighting, planters, a new bike lane—but not a full redesign. Advocates and Transportation Alternatives call for protected bike lanes and pedestrian plazas. Reynoso’s push highlights the gap between incremental fixes and the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, covering 750 school zones, needs state approval before June. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls speed cameras 'one of the most effective tools' to stop deadly driving. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who sponsored the last reauthorization, says, 'my bill to expand the speed camera program has saved lives.' The city wants stronger penalties for repeat offenders and action on license plate fraud, which lets millions of violations go unpunished. The report shows cameras cut speeding by 94 percent and reduce injuries and deaths. The program faces political hurdles, but the evidence is clear: speed cameras protect people on foot and bike. Lawmakers must decide whether to keep this life-saving tool.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
