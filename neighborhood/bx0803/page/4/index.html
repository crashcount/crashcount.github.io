Six seriously hurt. Seventy-six injured.</strong> These are not numbers from a war zone. They are the toll of traffic violence in Riverdale-Spuyten Duyvil since 2022. No one under 18 has died, but the old are not spared. A 99-year-old woman was killed crossing at West 235th and Oxford. She was struck by an SUV making a left turn. She died in the crosswalk. The driver failed to yield. The glare did not kill her. The car did. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The pain is steady. In the last year alone, 74 crashes left 30 people hurt. One was left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Pedestrians, cyclists, children—none are safe. SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. The numbers show it. <strong>SUVs killed. SUVs maimed.</strong></p><p>A bus nearly plunged off the Henry Hudson Parkway overpass in January. The driver swerved to avoid a double-parked car. The wall gave way. The bus hung over the edge. No one died, but the street was littered with debris and fear. &ldquo;We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it. Thankfully, nobody was hurt,&rdquo; <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz</a>.</p><h3 id=leaders-speak-streets-stay-dangerous>Leaders Speak. Streets Stay Dangerous.</h3><p>After the bus crash, Councilman Eric Dinowitz said, &ldquo;That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage. I think it speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car. And we’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced.&rdquo; <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->NY1</a></p><p>The words are true. The action is slow. The wall is still broken. The cars are still double-parked. The next crash waits.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It can build safer crossings. It can enforce the law. But it will not move unless you force it. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets where no one dies for crossing the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Eric Dinowitz, is under committee review. The legislation states, 'the city would have to install between one and five weather-proof enclosures with six to eight spaces apiece, depending on the size of the park.' Parks over 2.5 acres must have at least one shelter; parks over 250 acres need five. City buildings over 10,000 square feet, including public schools, must provide bike storage for workers and visitors. Marte said, 'If we want to get off the reliance of people commuting by car, we have to offer them alternative ways to get there.' The Parks Department and city agencies must report on implementation or explain impracticality. This bill targets safer, more accessible bike infrastructure for New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous.

The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry.
