Six seriously hurt. Seventy-six injured.</strong> These are not numbers from a war zone. They are the toll of traffic violence in Riverdale-Spuyten Duyvil since 2022. No one under 18 has died, but the old are not spared. A 99-year-old woman was killed crossing at West 235th and Oxford. She was struck by an SUV making a left turn. She died in the crosswalk. The driver failed to yield. The glare did not kill her.

In the last year alone, 74 crashes left 30 people hurt. One was left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Pedestrians, cyclists, children—none are safe. SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. The numbers show it. <strong>SUVs killed. SUVs maimed.</strong></p><p>A bus nearly plunged off the Henry Hudson Parkway overpass in January. The driver swerved to avoid a double-parked car. The wall gave way. The bus hung over the edge. No one died, but the street was littered with debris and fear. &ldquo;We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it. Thankfully, nobody was hurt,&rdquo; <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz</a>.</p><h3 id=leaders-speak-streets-stay-dangerous>Leaders Speak. Streets Stay Dangerous.</h3><p>After the bus crash, Councilman Eric Dinowitz said, &ldquo;That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage. I think it speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car. And we’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced.&rdquo; <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->NY1</a></p><p>The words are true. The action is slow. The wall is still broken. The cars are still double-parked. The next crash waits.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It can build safer crossings. It can enforce the law. But it will not move unless you force it. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets where no one dies for crossing the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz stated, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz highlighted the broader issue: "We’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced." The incident underscores the risks posed by illegal parking and the need for stricter enforcement and infrastructure checks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to limiting the amount of liability coverage that the taxi and limousine commission may require for vehicles it licenses," bars the TLC from requiring more personal injury protection than state law demands. Council Member Diana I. Ayala is the primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors including De La Rosa, Banks, Ossé, Marte, and others. The bill was laid over by committee on February 10, 2025. The measure would take effect immediately if passed. By capping required coverage, the bill may leave crash victims with less compensation after collisions involving TLC-licensed vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
