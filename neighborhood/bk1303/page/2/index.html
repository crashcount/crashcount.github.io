Three left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In Brighton Beach, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, 740 crashes. <strong>352 people injured.</strong> Three suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Two never walked again at all. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>The dead are not numbers. A 24-year-old cyclist, crushed by an SUV on Coney Island Avenue. A 35-year-old, gone. The living carry scars. A teenager crossing with the light, struck and left unconscious. A pedestrian, knees shattered by a turning truck. The pain is not abstract. It is bone, blood, and loss.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> One death, 28 moderate injuries, one serious injury. Trucks and buses: one serious injury, one moderate. Motorcycles and mopeds: two moderate injuries. Bikes: one moderate injury. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but the weight of steel always wins.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But Brighton Beach waits. The council and mayor have not acted. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but the law that keeps them running is at risk of expiring. The clock ticks. The streets stay the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Redesign the streets so people come first. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action for safer streets</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031.

The measure, heard in committee and passed 46-1-1, bans non-essential helicopters that fail FAA noise standards from East 34th Street and Wall Street heliports starting in late 2029. The matter summary states: 'ban noisy non-essential helicopter flights from city heliports following a recent fatal crash.' Majority Leader Amanda Farias, the sponsor, said, 'Intro 26 is a bold step toward a healthier, quieter, and more equitable city.' Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, District 48, voted against the bill. The legislation now awaits Mayor Eric Adams’ signature. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the bill responds to helicopter crashes that threaten New Yorkers on the ground.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
