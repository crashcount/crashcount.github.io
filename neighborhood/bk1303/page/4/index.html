Three left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In Brighton Beach, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, 740 crashes. <strong>352 people injured.</strong> Three suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Two never walked again at all. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>The dead are not numbers. A 24-year-old cyclist, crushed by an SUV on Coney Island Avenue. A 35-year-old, gone. The living carry scars. A teenager crossing with the light, struck and left unconscious. A pedestrian, knees shattered by a turning truck. The pain is not abstract. It is bone, blood, and loss.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> One death, 28 moderate injuries, one serious injury. Trucks and buses: one serious injury, one moderate. Motorcycles and mopeds: two moderate injuries. Bikes: one moderate injury. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but the weight of steel always wins.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But Brighton Beach waits. The council and mayor have not acted. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but the law that keeps them running is at risk of expiring. The clock ticks. The streets stay the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Redesign the streets so people come first. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action for safer streets</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented.

The matter, titled 'Mobility tax, other fees to prop up flailing MTA even after congestion toll — but Hochul’s plans remain secret,' centers on Governor Hochul’s undisclosed plans to hike the payroll mobility tax and add new fees, even after a $9 congestion toll. Vernikov, mentioned as a strong opponent, said, 'Governor Hochul has gifted the MTA free reign to grift NYC taxpayers into subsidizing their every irresponsible whim.' The bill’s status remains uncertain, with the state legislature previously rejecting a similar tax hike. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.
