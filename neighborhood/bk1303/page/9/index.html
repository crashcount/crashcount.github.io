Three left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In Brighton Beach, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, 740 crashes. <strong>352 people injured.</strong> Three suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Two never walked again at all. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>The dead are not numbers. A 24-year-old cyclist, crushed by an SUV on Coney Island Avenue. A 35-year-old, gone. The living carry scars. A teenager crossing with the light, struck and left unconscious. A pedestrian, knees shattered by a turning truck. The pain is not abstract. It is bone, blood, and loss.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> One death, 28 moderate injuries, one serious injury. Trucks and buses: one serious injury, one moderate. Motorcycles and mopeds: two moderate injuries. Bikes: one moderate injury. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but the weight of steel always wins.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But Brighton Beach waits. The council and mayor have not acted. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but the law that keeps them running is at risk of expiring. The clock ticks. The streets stay the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Redesign the streets so people come first. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action for safer streets</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

You have people with disabilities, you have people who just cannot tolerate the elimination of one stop." -- Alec Brook-Krasny</p><p class=mb3>On April 4, 2023, Council Member Phara Souffrant Forrest and other Brooklyn officials voiced strong opposition to the MTA’s Brooklyn bus network redesign. The draft plan, released in December, proposes increased spacing between stops, route changes, and new 'Rush' service. Key changes include the elimination and rerouting of the B48, which officials say 'removes a vital connection between Western Crown Heights and Greenpoint without any adequate transit replacement.' Forrest and others argue these cuts threaten accessibility for seniors and people with disabilities. Community members warn that longer distances between stops will hit the most vulnerable hardest. The MTA claims the redesign will bring 'more reliable, frequent service with better connections,' but public feedback shows deep concern. The plan remains under review, with workshops ongoing and legal hurdles for new bus lanes due to budget and staffing woes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous. Lawmakers are under pressure to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Diego Andrade, a pedestrian, was killed by the driver of a 2016 Mack sanitation truck turning left at E. 14th Street. The driver remained at the scene and faced no charges. The incident happened along a stretch with a history of frequent crashes—41 reported in the previous year on just ten blocks, injuring 13 pedestrians and one cyclist. The Department of Transportation has not addressed the dangers of this corridor since at least 2009. Residents voiced fear and frustration, calling drivers 'crazy' and demanding city action. The area’s councilmember, Inna Vernikov, has a record of repeated speeding violations, adding to the climate of danger. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law, passed October 26, 2020, aimed to educate repeat traffic offenders. It requires a course for owners with 15 speeding or 5 red-light tickets, but only if DOT chooses. As of November 28, 2022, just 630 drivers completed the course, and only 12 vehicles were seized. The law’s summary promised to 'educate vehicle owners about the dangers resulting from vehicle operators exceeding posted speed limits and failing to comply with traffic signals, including the potential to cause injury or death.' Council Member Inna Vernikov was named as an example of a driver reaching the threshold. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called for more teeth, saying, 'new data shows a clear need for additional investments in the program to get dangerous vehicles off our streets.' The program’s weak enforcement leaves thousands of reckless drivers unpunished, endangering vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets near schools remain deadly, especially for children of color.</p><p class=mb3>On September 15, 2022, a hit-and-run driver injured a 10-year-old boy at W. 20th Street and Mermaid Avenue in Coney Island. The boy, walking home from school with his grandmother, was struck as the driver sped through a red light and fled the scene. Witnesses described chaos and pain. Streetsblog reports, 'streets near schools are more dangerous on average than other city streets.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, whose district includes the area, was recently caught speeding in school zones 23 times. Data shows a 57% higher crash rate and 25% more injuries per mile near schools during peak hours. The danger is worse outside schools serving mostly students of color. The 60th Precinct, where the crash occurred, has seen 711 crashes this year, injuring 57 pedestrians and 26 cyclists. Systemic neglect and reckless driving keep children at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say her record endangers children and all road users.</p><p class=mb3>Council Member Inna Vernikov’s car received 23 school-zone speeding tickets since mid-2020, including nine in 2022. She voted against the Council’s home rule message to expand New York’s speed camera program, which would allow 24/7 automated enforcement. Vernikov called speed cameras a scheme to 'take away more of our hard-earned money.' The bill, debated in September 2022, was opposed by Vernikov and others, despite rising traffic deaths. Her car also received 31 non-moving violations, including parking at fire hydrants and in bus lanes. Democratic challenger Amber Adler and StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure condemned Vernikov’s driving and her vote, saying she endangers constituents. Vernikov has advocated for armed guards and mental health reforms in schools, but opposes proven traffic safety measures. No safety analyst assessment was provided for this action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
