Three left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In Brighton Beach, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, 740 crashes. <strong>352 people injured.</strong> Three suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Two never walked again at all. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>The dead are not numbers. A 24-year-old cyclist, crushed by an SUV on Coney Island Avenue. A 35-year-old, gone. The living carry scars. A teenager crossing with the light, struck and left unconscious. A pedestrian, knees shattered by a turning truck. The pain is not abstract. It is bone, blood, and loss.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> One death, 28 moderate injuries, one serious injury. Trucks and buses: one serious injury, one moderate. Motorcycles and mopeds: two moderate injuries. Bikes: one moderate injury. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but the weight of steel always wins.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But Brighton Beach waits. The council and mayor have not acted. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but the law that keeps them running is at risk of expiring. The clock ticks. The streets stay the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Redesign the streets so people come first. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action for safer streets</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton (D-23) joined 17 other lawmakers in a lawsuit against the plan, which would charge drivers entering Midtown Manhattan. The editorial claims, 'solving [MTA fiscal problems] by punishing average New Yorkers simply for driving is insane,' and highlights concerns over economic burden. The piece quotes union leaders and lawmakers, including Scarcella-Spanton, City Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli, and US Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, all opposing the tolls. There is no assessment of the impact on vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, or transit riders. The focus remains on driver expenses and political backlash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Borelli (District 51) joined seventeen other lawmakers in a federal lawsuit to block New York City’s $15 congestion pricing toll for Midtown Manhattan. The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation. The case highlights the political and environmental battle over how to fund and shape New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
