Three left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In Brighton Beach, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, 740 crashes. <strong>352 people injured.</strong> Three suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Two never walked again at all. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>The dead are not numbers. A 24-year-old cyclist, crushed by an SUV on Coney Island Avenue. A 35-year-old, gone. The living carry scars. A teenager crossing with the light, struck and left unconscious. A pedestrian, knees shattered by a turning truck. The pain is not abstract. It is bone, blood, and loss.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> One death, 28 moderate injuries, one serious injury. Trucks and buses: one serious injury, one moderate. Motorcycles and mopeds: two moderate injuries. Bikes: one moderate injury. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but the weight of steel always wins.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But Brighton Beach waits. The council and mayor have not acted. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but the law that keeps them running is at risk of expiring. The clock ticks. The streets stay the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Redesign the streets so people come first. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action for safer streets</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On Staten Island, officers responding to a gun call swerved to avoid a U-turning car, lost control, and crashed into a shuttered restaurant. Both officers were hospitalized with minor injuries. Hours earlier in Manhattan, a Dodge Charger changed lanes, clipped a street sweeper, spun out, and pinned an officer against his patrol SUV. Surveillance footage showed the Charger 'spinning out of control before hitting the officer.' Witness Abi Aguirre described the chaos: 'It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car.' Both incidents highlight the risks posed by high-speed responses and sudden driver maneuvers. Storefronts and sidewalks offered little protection.

He struck pedestrian Katherine Harris, 31, killing her instantly, then rear-ended another car and crashed into an outdoor dining shed. Trujillo's blood alcohol level was .17, more than twice the legal limit.

The official matter focused on 'excessive illegal parking—including by the local police precinct.' CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers.
