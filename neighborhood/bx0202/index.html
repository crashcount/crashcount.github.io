Nine seriously hurt.</strong> In Longwood, from 2022 to June 2025, the street keeps taking. One man, 56, crushed by an SUV at the intersection of East 163rd and Westchester. Another, 60, struck and killed on Hoe Avenue. A third, 34, died behind the wheel. The numbers are not just numbers. They are fathers, sons, neighbors. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>In the last year alone:</strong> 1 killed, 2 seriously injured, 162 hurt. Children are not spared. Twenty-four under 18 have been injured. The street does not care about age.</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, cars and trucks killed two, left one with life-changing wounds, and caused dozens of injuries. Buses, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of steel is heaviest. Speed, failure to yield, and inattention are the usual suspects. The crosswalk is no guarantee. The light means nothing if the driver does not see you.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. They point to more speed cameras, more intersection redesigns. But in Longwood, the pace is slow. The deaths do not wait for ribbon cuttings. The city has the power to drop the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The clock ticks.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand working speed cameras. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
