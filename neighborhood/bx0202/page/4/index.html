Nine seriously hurt.</strong> In Longwood, from 2022 to June 2025, the street keeps taking. One man, 56, crushed by an SUV at the intersection of East 163rd and Westchester. Another, 60, struck and killed on Hoe Avenue. A third, 34, died behind the wheel. The numbers are not just numbers. They are fathers, sons, neighbors. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>In the last year alone:</strong> 1 killed, 2 seriously injured, 162 hurt. Children are not spared. Twenty-four under 18 have been injured. The street does not care about age.</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, cars and trucks killed two, left one with life-changing wounds, and caused dozens of injuries. Buses, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of steel is heaviest. Speed, failure to yield, and inattention are the usual suspects. The crosswalk is no guarantee. The light means nothing if the driver does not see you.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. They point to more speed cameras, more intersection redesigns. But in Longwood, the pace is slow. The deaths do not wait for ribbon cuttings. The city has the power to drop the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The clock ticks.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand working speed cameras. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable users remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the MTA capital plan funding debate as of July 30, 2024. The MTA’s 2025-29 capital program, discussed at the Capital Program Committee meeting, remains unfunded after Governor Hochul’s indefinite delay of congestion pricing. The matter centers on the need for new rail cars, power stations, and repairs to tracks and tunnels. MTA President of Construction and Development Jamie Torres-Springer stressed, 'We need to achieve 100 percent state-of-good-repair.' State Senator Jeremy Cooney challenged the governor to restore funding or implement congestion pricing within 100 days. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein urged, 'Gov. Hochul must start congestion pricing now to rebuild trust.' The MTA is $15 billion short on its 2020-24 plan, with no clear path forward. Transit advocates warn that underfunding public transit puts riders—especially those on foot or bike—at continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users face more cars, more risk.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2024, the City Council held a hearing on proposed rezonings around new Metro-North stations in the Bronx. The matter, titled 'Transit-Oriented Bronx Developments Will Have Ample Parking, Developers Tell Council,' focused on whether to require parking in new residential and commercial projects. Council Members Amanda Faris, Kevin C. Riley, Rafael Salamanca, and Kristy Marmorato all pressed for developers to include parking, despite the city's move to waive mandates. Riley called parking 'a huge issue.' Developers, including Baker Development, promised up to 200 spaces per project. Bronx City Planning Director Paul Philips said, 'We certainly expect developers to provide parking.' The debate ignored the danger more parking brings: more cars, more conflict, more risk for people walking and biking. No safety analyst weighed in, but the outcome is clear—transit-oriented in name, car-centric in practice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bills aim to address 'myriad health and safety concerns' from e-bike crashes, battery fires, and low pay. Councilmember Lynn Schulman, District 29, spoke out: 'Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed... This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk.' Three bills would make apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash responsible for vehicle safety and compliance, require them to provide safety-compliant e-bikes, and ensure mopeds are registered. Other bills target pay transparency and tip protections. Councilmembers Shaun Abreu and Rafael Salamanca also spoke in support. The measures seek to hold companies accountable for dangers faced by vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
