Nineteen left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In just over three years, Springfield Gardens (South)-Brookville has seen 1,812 crashes. <strong>One thousand three hundred thirty-eight people hurt in the last three years, and four hundred in the last twelve months alone.</strong> The numbers are not just numbers. They are families, neighbors, children. They are lives cut short or changed forever.

Trucks crush.</strong> In this corner of Queens, every death in the last year came from a car or truck. Not a single cyclist killed. Not a single moped. The violence is relentless and ordinary: a sedan on the Belt Parkway, a truck on the Nassau Expressway, a BMW at the intersection. The machines are different, but the outcome is the same. <strong>People die.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-progress-delay-and-the-cost-of-waiting>Leadership: Progress, Delay, and the Cost of Waiting</h3><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed.</strong> The tools are there. But the clock ticks. <strong>Two people killed so far this year.</strong> Last year, it was one. The year before, four. The trend is not down. It is steady. It is slow. It is not enough.</p><p>Local leaders have the chance to act. They can push for lower speed limits, more cameras, safer crossings. They can fight for the living, not just mourn the dead. But every delay is another family left to grieve.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power, or someone who looked away. If you live here, you know the streets. You know the danger. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Accountability is lacking.</p><p class=mb3>On December 28, 2023, Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers responded to the death of an 82-year-old cyclist killed by a hit-and-run truck on Northern Boulevard. This incident marked the 29th cyclist fatality in 2023, a grim milestone in a year of rising traffic violence. Brooks-Powers criticized the Adams administration and the Department of Transportation for failing to meet the Streets Plan's legal requirement of 50 miles of protected bike lanes, achieving only about 30 miles. She stated, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Brooks-Powers also condemned the missed bus lane targets and called out DOT's lack of transparency, pledging to hold the agency accountable and push for safer, more equitable streets. The city faces more cars, more crashes, and more injuries, while vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, voiced 'serious concerns about the proposal’s impact on her constituents, especially with the looming arrival of congestion pricing.' She called for an 'equitable and balanced' approach. The plan faces backlash over wider stop spacing and fewer stops, which could force longer walks for riders—many of them elderly or disabled.

The effort, known as daylighting, aims to improve visibility and pedestrian safety. Adams said, 'Protecting New Yorkers is my most sacred responsibility as mayor.' Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers praised daylighting as 'a proven safety measure.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stressed that daylighting must include physical infrastructure to prevent reckless turns. The Department of Transportation will also add raised crosswalks, extended sidewalks, and leading pedestrian signals at 1,000 intersections next year. The city will expand speed restriction technology in its fleet and increase data transparency. Advocates and community boards have long called for these changes. With nearly 47,000 intersections citywide, the plan will take decades to reach every corner.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, quotes Adams: the fee is 'the beginning of the conversation' and exemptions must be considered. Councilmember Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, echoed concerns, saying the toll 'is going to put definitely a hardship on many of my constituents.' Experts Bruce Schaller and Danny Pearlstein criticized Adams, urging him to champion the program’s benefits for transit riders and the environment. The mayor’s office later clarified his comments focused on city workers in city vehicles. The article notes that while a small fraction of Brooks-Powers’s constituents drive into Manhattan, all would benefit from improved transit. Adams’s wavering undermines momentum for a policy proven to reduce traffic and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024.

The street stays dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On November 1, 2023, following the death of 7-year-old Kamari Hughes, Mayor Adams and his administration announced plans to redesign the fatal Brooklyn intersection. The Department of Transportation adjusted signal timing and promised more robust changes, including daylighting and loading zones. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers called daylighting 'a proven safety measure.' Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi said the city will target high-crash and school-adjacent corners, using barriers to keep cars from blocking sightlines. Critics like Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city’s reactive approach, demanding daylighting at every intersection. Officials claim 299 intersections have been daylighted this year, surpassing Council mandates. Despite these steps, advocates argue the city acts only after tragedy, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
