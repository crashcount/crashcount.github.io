Nineteen left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In just over three years, Springfield Gardens (South)-Brookville has seen 1,812 crashes. <strong>One thousand three hundred thirty-eight people hurt in the last three years, and four hundred in the last twelve months alone.</strong> The numbers are not just numbers. They are families, neighbors, children. They are lives cut short or changed forever.

Trucks crush.</strong> In this corner of Queens, every death in the last year came from a car or truck. Not a single cyclist killed. Not a single moped. The violence is relentless and ordinary: a sedan on the Belt Parkway, a truck on the Nassau Expressway, a BMW at the intersection. The machines are different, but the outcome is the same. <strong>People die.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-progress-delay-and-the-cost-of-waiting>Leadership: Progress, Delay, and the Cost of Waiting</h3><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed.</strong> The tools are there. But the clock ticks. <strong>Two people killed so far this year.</strong> Last year, it was one. The year before, four. The trend is not down. It is steady. It is slow. It is not enough.</p><p>Local leaders have the chance to act. They can push for lower speed limits, more cameras, safer crossings. They can fight for the living, not just mourn the dead. But every delay is another family left to grieve.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power, or someone who looked away. If you live here, you know the streets. You know the danger. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash injured three people: a 7-year-old girl with a broken femur and head injury, a 14-year-old girl with leg injuries, and a 58-year-old man with bruises. Police arrested Bah and charged her with 'reckless endangerment, reckless driving and driving without a license.'

At a community meeting, Brooks-Powers said, "We’ve been trying to get [the bike lane] removed for three years. It wasn’t supported by the community. ... In effect it’s not a bike lane quite honestly; no one uses it, they [drivers] park there. We would like to see the hard infrastructure removed." Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that building safe bike lanes requires support from local leaders. DOT spokesperson Will Livingston said the agency remains committed to safety and will explore hardening the lane and increasing enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They warned, 'The limited funding and decreases in funding that have occurred over the years jeopardize the continuity and future of the program—funding pressure is already leading to downsizing and the disappearance of Open Streets programs.' The groups seek $48 million over three years, separate from the city’s $30 million contract with the Horticultural Society. Current grants max out at $20,000 per year, forcing cutbacks. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams are starting budget talks. Council spokesperson Julia Agos called Open Streets 'critical components of our city's public realm.' The Department of Transportation said suggestions will be reviewed.

The resolution demands hard data on traffic, pollution, and social fallout. Sponsors want answers for neighborhoods outside the toll zone, where cars may flood next.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0735-2025 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 13, 2025, it urges the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to conduct 'longitudinal studies on the environmental, economic, and social impacts of congestion pricing throughout New York City.' Council Member Lynn C. Schulman leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Farías, Louis, Riley, Williams, and Banks. The measure responds to fears that congestion pricing could shift traffic and pollution to outer boroughs, especially transit deserts. The sponsors want the MTA to track real-world effects—on air, streets, and people—so the city can adapt the program and protect vulnerable communities. The bill is under committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
