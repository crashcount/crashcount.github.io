Nineteen left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In just over three years, Springfield Gardens (South)-Brookville has seen 1,812 crashes. <strong>One thousand three hundred thirty-eight people hurt in the last three years, and four hundred in the last twelve months alone.</strong> The numbers are not just numbers. They are families, neighbors, children. They are lives cut short or changed forever.

Trucks crush.</strong> In this corner of Queens, every death in the last year came from a car or truck. Not a single cyclist killed. Not a single moped. The violence is relentless and ordinary: a sedan on the Belt Parkway, a truck on the Nassau Expressway, a BMW at the intersection. The machines are different, but the outcome is the same. <strong>People die.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-progress-delay-and-the-cost-of-waiting>Leadership: Progress, Delay, and the Cost of Waiting</h3><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed.</strong> The tools are there. But the clock ticks. <strong>Two people killed so far this year.</strong> Last year, it was one. The year before, four. The trend is not down. It is steady. It is slow. It is not enough.</p><p>Local leaders have the chance to act. They can push for lower speed limits, more cameras, safer crossings. They can fight for the living, not just mourn the dead. But every delay is another family left to grieve.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power, or someone who looked away. If you live here, you know the streets. You know the danger. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

This follows Mayor Adams’s earlier $35 million commitment. The matter centers on whether to build a park or restore rail service—"Its purpose is to derail the train," said Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director. City Hall, represented by spokesperson Charles Lutvak, insists, "The proposed Met Hub does not preclude an MTA project if [MTA officials] determine one is feasible." Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi echoed, "Those two don't directly conflict." State Sen. James Sanders Jr. continues to push for QueensLink funding. The city’s investments so far favor the park, leaving the rail proposal in limbo.
