She has also <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-parents-struggle-to-get-crossing-guards-after-2-students-killed-in-traffic>demanded more crossing guards</a> after two children were killed, saying, &ldquo;You would think that this is one of the most basic ways to protect the safety of our children.

Two new bus routes will replace it. Jessica Ramos cheered the move. The AirTrain’s high price and twisted route drew fire. Buses promise faster, cheaper, cleaner rides for millions. Queens riders win. Cars lose.</p><p class=mb3>""This is the right move. My neighbors who live around LaGuardia deserve transit that is for them, not whatever that boondoggle was. I’m so proud of East Elmhurst for standing up to this bad plan. We still have to look at how to expand transit to those parts of Queens, especially if the proposed football stadium is going to be building what effectively is a new neighborhood in Queens. The 7 alone won’t be able to handle it."" -- Jessica Ramos</p><p class=mb3>On March 13, 2023, Governor Hochul canceled the Cuomo-era LaGuardia AirTrain project after an expert panel review. The panel found the $2-billion monorail would not outperform improved bus service. Instead, two new bus routes will serve the airport: an upgraded Q70 Select Bus Service with a dedicated BQE lane, and a new non-stop bus rapid transit line from Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard using electric buses and transit signal priority. The total cost is about $500 million, far less than any rail option. State Senator Jessica Ramos, district 13, praised the decision, saying, 'My neighbors who live around LaGuardia deserve transit that is for them, not whatever that boondoggle was.' The AirTrain faced mounting opposition for its cost, indirect route, and lack of transparency. The new bus plan aims to serve millions of riders annually and can be implemented within two to five years.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She chose faster, cheaper bus routes instead. The new plan brings electric buses, dedicated lanes, and direct service. Advocates cheered. Queens riders win. The AirTrain dies. Buses roll on.</p><p class=mb3>On March 13, 2023, Governor Hochul and the Port Authority canceled the Cuomo-era LaGuardia AirTrain project. The decision followed an expert panel review, which found the $2 billion monorail would not outperform expanded bus service. Instead, the panel recommended two new bus routes: an upgraded Q70 Select Bus Service with a dedicated BQE lane, and a nonstop bus rapid transit line from Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard to all LaGuardia terminals, using electric buses and transit signal priority. The matter summary states: 'Gov. Hochul and the Port Authority have canceled the controversial Cuomo-era LaGuardia AirTrain project, opting instead for two new, improved bus connections to the airport.' State Senator Jessica Ramos welcomed the move, saying, 'My neighbors who live around LaGuardia deserve transit that is for them, not whatever that boondoggle was.' Advocates and elected officials praised the shift, though some called for even stronger bus priority and further transit expansion in Queens.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jessica Ramos and colleagues sent a letter to city and state DOTs urging action against the 'demonization' of e-bikes and e-scooters. The letter, signed by Ramos and State Sen. Liz Krueger, demanded more education on safe riding and battery use, warning, 'We cannot allow a narrative to build against a vital, green, and growing mode of transportation.' Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries. The senators warned that inaction could lead to blanket bans, hitting delivery workers hardest. The city’s plan for safe charging hubs faces local opposition.

Lawmakers passed Carlos' Law, raising fines for negligent companies to $500,000. State Sen. Jessica Ramos calls it vital as migrants fill non-union jobs. Advocates warn: enforcement and worker awareness still lag.</p><p class=mb3>Carlos' Law, passed in early 2023, raises the maximum penalty for construction companies convicted of criminal negligence leading to worker injury or death from $10,000 to $500,000. The law, named after Carlos Moncayo, aims to curb a surge in construction worker deaths—22 in the past year, the highest in five years. State Sen. Jessica Ramos, representing District 13, called the law 'critically needed' as thousands of migrants enter non-union construction jobs lacking basic safety protections. Ramos and other lawmakers supported the bill, but advocates and union officials warn that without strong enforcement and education for new arrivals, deaths and injuries will persist. The law passed after years of advocacy, but the minimum fine was removed, and nonprofits struggle to train the influx of new workers. As Ramos said, 'Behind every worker is a family expecting them to return home.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Over 20 surpass 2019 numbers. Riders are workers, immigrants, people of color. MTA tweaks service—adds some, cuts some. Waits grow. Calls mount for more funding. Riders need frequent trains. Lives depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2023, Comptroller Tom DiNapoli reported that more than 20 New York City subway stations exceeded pre-pandemic ridership in December 2022. The recovery, strongest in outer boroughs and Upper Manhattan, highlights the reliance of working-class, immigrant, and communities of color on transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber said, 'these New Yorkers deserve the same frequent, safe reliable service that they've come to depend on over time.' State Sen. Jessica Ramos, representing the 7 train corridor, demanded state funding for six-minute off-peak service, noting, 'my neighbors are the ones who do work that they can't do from home.' The MTA has made service adjustments—some lines see more weekend trains, but peak service is trimmed, leading to longer waits. As total ridership lags, agency leaders and advocates warn that cuts hit those who need transit most. The fight for reliable, frequent service continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
