Since 2022, there have been <strong>940 crashes</strong>. <strong>One person is dead. Six are seriously hurt.</strong> The rest carry wounds that do not always heal. In the last year alone, <strong>178 people were injured</strong>—<strong>19 of them children</strong>. One young man, age 18–24, did not make it home.</p><p>The numbers are not just numbers.

In February, a 31-year-old on an e-bike was crushed by a truck at 108th Street. Last summer, a 17-year-old cyclist was thrown from his bike and left semiconscious on the pavement.

She has also <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-parents-struggle-to-get-crossing-guards-after-2-students-killed-in-traffic>demanded more crossing guards</a> after two children were killed, saying, &ldquo;You would think that this is one of the most basic ways to protect the safety of our children. And yet that seems like an insurmountable task.&rdquo;</p><p>But the city moves slow. Promises pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. <strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, protected bike lanes, and real enforcement against reckless drivers.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
