In the past twelve months, <strong>one person died and 155 were injured</strong> in crashes here. Two suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The toll is not numbers. It is a father who will not come home, a teenager with a bandaged head, a cyclist left bleeding on the curb.</p><p><strong>Northern Boulevard is a killing ground.</strong> In February, a 23-year-old man, Justin Diaz, was driving to work. He never made it. An off-duty firefighter, drunk and high, sped through a red light at 83 miles per hour and hit him broadside. Diaz died at Elmhurst Hospital. His mother <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ex-off-duty-firefighter-accused-dwi-speeding-fatal-crash-due-queens-court/16189771/>said, &ldquo;My son&rsquo;s life mattered just like anyone else&rsquo;s. An innocent 23-year-old going to work. It&rsquo;s very, very sad. My heart is broken forever.&rdquo;</a></p><p>The driver, Michael Pena, had <strong>25 school zone speeding tickets</strong> in the past year. He is charged with manslaughter. The system let him keep driving. Justin&rsquo;s brother <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>said, &ldquo;He is a dangerous person who should have never been on these streets,&rdquo;</a>.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie><strong>The Numbers Do Not Lie</strong></h3><p>In three and a half years, North Corona saw <strong>851 crashes, 442 injuries, 5 serious injuries, and 1 death</strong>. The wounded are not just drivers. <strong>45 children under 18</strong> were hurt. Cyclists and pedestrians are struck by cars, SUVs, trucks, and motorcycles. The street is a gauntlet.</p><p>SUVs and sedans are the main weapons. In the last year, they caused the most injuries to pedestrians. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds also left people bleeding. The violence is relentless, the pattern clear.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-action><strong>Leadership: Words, Not Action</strong></h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. But the blood on Northern Boulevard says otherwise. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so here. Speed cameras work, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-now><strong>What Now?</strong></h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that do not kill. Do not wait for another family to grieve. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
