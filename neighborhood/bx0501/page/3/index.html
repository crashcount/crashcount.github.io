Nine left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In the last three and a half years, the streets of University Heights (South)-Morris Heights have not been quiet. There have been <strong>1,051 crashes</strong>. <strong>707 people hurt</strong>. Each number is a body. Each body is a story that ends or changes on the asphalt. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists are not safe here.</strong> In the last year, one person died. Three more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared. Thirteen under 18 were hurt in the last twelve months. One was seriously injured. The old are not spared. The numbers do not care about age.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the damage.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, box trucks. They strike, they crush, they burn. In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed two pedestrians and left dozens more with broken bones and broken lives. Trucks took another life. Motorcycles and mopeds left three more with moderate injuries. Bicycles did not kill anyone. The street is a battlefield, but only one side is armored.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. They say they are redesigning intersections, lowering speed limits, installing cameras. But here, the pace is slow. The carnage is not. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Speed cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. Each day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a failure of will. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.

The moving vehicle's right front bumper struck the left rear bumper of the parked car. The driver of the moving sedan, a 25-year-old male, sustained back injuries and whiplash but was conscious and not ejected. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor, along with slippery pavement conditions. Both vehicles were occupied by a single male driver, each licensed in different states. The collision resulted from the moving driver's failure to maintain attention, leading to impact with the stationary vehicle.
