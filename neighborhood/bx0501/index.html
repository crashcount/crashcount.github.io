Nine left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In the last three and a half years, the streets of University Heights (South)-Morris Heights have not been quiet. There have been <strong>1,051 crashes</strong>. <strong>707 people hurt</strong>. Each number is a body. Each body is a story that ends or changes on the asphalt. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists are not safe here.</strong> In the last year, one person died. Three more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared. Thirteen under 18 were hurt in the last twelve months. One was seriously injured. The old are not spared. The numbers do not care about age.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the damage.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, box trucks. They strike, they crush, they burn. In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed two pedestrians and left dozens more with broken bones and broken lives. Trucks took another life. Motorcycles and mopeds left three more with moderate injuries. Bicycles did not kill anyone. The street is a battlefield, but only one side is armored.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. They say they are redesigning intersections, lowering speed limits, installing cameras. But here, the pace is slow. The carnage is not. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Speed cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. Each day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a failure of will. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep.

Adams admits the plan is 'an idea' needing state approval and a lengthy rulemaking process. Critics like Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives call the proposal 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' arguing it unfairly targets cyclists while drivers face lesser consequences for greater harm. Janet Schroeder of the NYC E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the limit will matter without enforcement: 'The 15 mph speed limit does nothing.' The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor infractions.
