They say every life matters. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired. No replacement yet. <strong>The clock runs out for the living.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.</strong> It is policy. It is delay. It is silence. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home. <strong>Contact your council member. Demand the city lower the speed limit. Demand Albany protect speed cameras.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Fewer cars, more space for people. The numbers demand it.</p><p class=mb3>On June 30, 2023, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced a sweeping policy shift: the new 'Street Code.' The plan, described as giving 'absolute priority for pedestrians,' will remove 70,000 parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, widen sidewalks, and expand bike lanes. Hidalgo rejects harsh measures against e-bikes, focusing instead on reducing car dominance and discouraging SUVs through progressive parking fees. Council Member Gale A. Brewer, District 6, is mentioned in the context of New York’s contrasting approach, where enforcement often targets e-bikes rather than cars. Advocates highlight that cars and trucks cause most pedestrian injuries and deaths. They urge New York to emulate Paris—reclaiming street space from cars, not blaming micromobility. The data is clear: fewer cars mean safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

After three violations in a year, the vehicle would be towed if found in violation again.

In a letter, Hoylman-Sigal wrote, "We urge you to create a unified payment system as expeditiously as possible." The proposal aims to remove barriers for would-be Citi Bike users and address issues like vandalized QR codes. The bill is a policy proposal, not yet in committee or up for a vote. Hoylman-Sigal’s push highlights the fractured nature of New York’s fare systems, with separate payments for subways, bikes, ferries, and regional trains. While OMNY integration could streamline access, technical and financial hurdles remain. The MTA and Cubic, OMNY’s contractor, say they are reviewing expansion opportunities.

The debate underscores a systemic failure: without public investment, bike-share stays out of reach for those who need it most. No formal safety analysis was provided, but advocates stress that lack of access keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The deal keeps the system afloat but relies on private money, not public funds. The matter, described as a debate on public funding for bike-share expansion, highlights the city’s outlier status among major bike-share cities. Council Member Erik Bottcher and others voiced concerns over poor service and limited reach. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called for city funding to expand access and lower prices. Justin Brannan criticized the system’s neglect of outer boroughs. Mayor Adams’s 2021 pledge to fund expansion remains unfulfilled. Advocates and labor leaders say public funding is vital for equity, affordability, and reliability. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
