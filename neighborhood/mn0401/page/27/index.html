Six people killed. Fifteen left with serious injuries. Eight hundred eleven injured since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><p>Just last week, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled, drove onto the sidewalk, and later told police he ran because he did not have a license. The cyclist was left with a broken skull. The driver now faces charges for leaving the scene and driving unlicensed. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>He told police he fled initially because he did not have a license.</a></p><p>On 8th Avenue and West 25th, an 86-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal. The driver was unlicensed. The crash report lists &ldquo;failure to yield&rdquo; and &ldquo;driver inattention.&rdquo; There are no second chances at the curb.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>SUVs and cars did the most harm. They killed one, seriously injured three, and left over 150 hurt. Trucks and buses injured dozens more. Bikes and mopeds added to the toll, but the weight of death rides on four wheels or more.</p><p>The stories repeat. A cyclist crushed by a taxi. A pedestrian struck by a sedan. A box truck rips into a cab. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The bike lane is not safe.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He backed it in committee.</a> Assembly Member Tony Simone co-sponsored bills to expand camera enforcement and hold vehicle owners liable. Council Member Erik Bottcher sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The carnage is not. Every week brings new blood to the street.</p><h2 id=the-words-of-the-street>The Words of the Street</h2><p>A resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> Another called for action: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h2><p>Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets that do not kill.</p><p>The city will not change unless you force it. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The knee-jerk opposition to them has dissipated and now we can build on the success of the 24-hour camera bill to introduce and pass more legislation."" -- Brad Hoylman-Sigal</p><p class=mb3>The 2022 New York State legislative session reviewed transportation and street safety policy, with Council Member Adrienne Adams (District 28) mentioned in coverage. Lawmakers extended New York City's school-zone speed camera program for three years, allowing 24/7 operation—a win for street safety. The bill, however, was watered down. Other measures under the 'Crash Victims Rights and Safety Act' saw mixed results: some passed, like upstate towns setting 25 mph speed limits and increased complete streets funding; others, like 'Sammy's Law' for NYC speed limits and expanded safe passing for cyclists, stalled. The matter title called the session 'historic, yet deeply disappointing.' Adams was not a sponsor but was referenced in the debate. Advocates and senators voiced frustration at the lack of progress on local speed limit control and measures against repeat reckless drivers. The session left vulnerable road users without key protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>The 2022 New York State legislative session ended on June 6, 2022. Lawmakers extended and expanded New York City’s school-zone speed camera program to operate 24/7 for three more years. The bill passed, but was watered down from its original form. Other key street safety bills, including 'Sammy’s Law'—which would let NYC set its own speed limits—did not advance. Senator Andrew Gounardes called the speed camera win 'monumental,' while Senator Brad Hoylman said, 'not as much as any of us would have wanted to see, but for the first time, speed cameras are normalized.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives voiced disappointment over the failure of Sammy’s Law, calling it a top priority for Families for Safe Streets. Several other bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists stalled or died in committee. The session brought some progress, but left many dangers unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to fine drivers $50 for each infraction, targeting those who block or drive in bike lanes. The matter summary states: 'NYC pols propose traffic cameras to deter drivers from using bike lanes.' Mamdani and Hoylman argue that enforcement is critical, with Mamdani stating, 'You consistently see cars driving in the bike lane. We know that these cameras work to deter drivers from breaking the law.' DOT supports the measure, calling it 'life-saving automated enforcement technology.' The bill awaits City Council approval, with Mamdani pledging to advance it through the summer and fall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
