An ambulance killed a man at an intersection. Bikes and e-bikes are not immune. Two serious injuries came from bikes. The violence is steady, relentless, and ordinary.

The city touts new <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>speed cameras</a>, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. <strong>One death is too many. Three is a scandal.</strong></p><p>Local leaders have the tools. They can push for a 20 mph speed limit. They can demand more protected crossings, more daylighting, more enforcement. They can fight for the renewal of programs that hold reckless drivers accountable. Or they can wait, and count the bodies.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>Act now.

Albany holds the key.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0449-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced June 6, 2024, it urges the State Legislature to let cities raise the cap on commercial overnight parking fines. The matter title reads: "Resolution calling on the State legislature to increase the cap on commercial overnight fines for cities." Council Members Eric Dinowitz (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, and Robert F. Holden back the measure. They argue that capped fines are too low—companies absorb them, streets clog with trucks, and residents pay the price. The Council wants authority to set fines that actually deter illegal parking. The resolution points to nearly 27,000 complaints in 2021 and notes that current enforcement tools are weak. The bill is still in committee, awaiting further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Twenty-nine dead last year. Highest ever. Reckless drivers surge post-pandemic. City report demands more cameras—jump from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Officials back the bill. Victims’ families demand action. Cameras cut crashes. But the most dangerous drivers remain loose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2024, the Department of Transportation released a report urging passage of a bill to expand New York City’s red-light camera program. The bill, supported by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and sponsored by State Senator Andrew Goundardes, would boost camera coverage from 150 to 1,325 intersections—about 10% of the city’s 13,700 signals. The report states: “Expanding the number of intersections with red light cameras... could substantially enhance the deterrent effect of the program and return New York City to the consistently downward trend of red light-running behavior we had seen prior to the pandemic.” Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz also supports expansion, calling for cameras at every intersection. The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains. Relatives of crash victims joined the call, demanding the city confront driver negligence and protect the community.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
