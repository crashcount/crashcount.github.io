A bus bears down. The street swallows another life. In the past twelve months, <strong>six people died</strong> on Midtown-Times Square streets. <strong>Nine more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>408 injured, 752 crashes</strong> in a single year. Each one a story cut short, a body broken, a family left waiting for a call that never comes.</p><p><strong>SUVs, taxis, bikes, and buses</strong> all play their part. The old and the young are not spared. A woman, 83, crossing with the signal, struck and killed by an SUV turning left at 58th and Sixth. Two cyclists, both 67, dead after a collision with a parked SUV on Fifth Avenue. A 39-year-old man, not even in the roadway, killed by a bus and a boom lift on East 51st. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=promises-and-delays-from-city-hall>Promises and Delays from City Hall</h3><p>City leaders talk about safety. They promise change. Mayor Eric Adams calls Fifth Avenue a place where &ldquo;more people walk down the street every hour than fill Madison Square Garden during a sold-out Knicks game&rdquo; and says the city is &ldquo;finally making&mldr; a pedestrian paradise by making it more walkable, greener, and safer&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/manhattan/5th-avenue-redesign-2028/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city will spend $400 million to widen sidewalks and plant trees. But the plan skips bus lanes and bike lanes. Riders Alliance calls it out: &ldquo;Two mayors have now disregarded city workers&rsquo; plans for a busway, throwing riders under the bus to favor luxury boutiques&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>said Danny Pearlstein</a>.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians make up 70% of Fifth Avenue traffic but get less than half the space.</strong> Buses crawl. Cyclists dodge doors and trucks. The city claims progress, but the most vulnerable are still left in the street.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down plan, every missing lane is a choice. The dead cannot speak. The living must. <strong>Call your council member. Demand bus lanes, bike lanes, and real protection for people on foot and on wheels.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A 34-year-old male bicyclist traveling east was struck on the center front end of his bike by the left side doors of a parked 2023 Chevrolet sedan. The bicyclist sustained contusions and bruises to his knee, lower leg, and foot but was conscious and not ejected. The report cites 'Passenger Distraction' as a contributing factor, indicating that occupants in the sedan distracted the driver or affected vehicle safety. The sedan was stationary before the crash, suggesting the injury resulted from the opening of the door into the cyclist’s path. No victim behaviors were listed as contributing factors. This incident underscores the systemic danger posed by inattentive vehicle occupants opening doors into active bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Council Member Diana I. Ayala is the primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors including De La Rosa, Banks, Ossé, Marte, and others. The bill was laid over by committee on February 10, 2025. The measure would take effect immediately if passed.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
