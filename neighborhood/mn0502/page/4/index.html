Elected officials representing this area have come out in support of it.

The matter, described as a 'highly-anticipated 34th Street busway,' had support from Council Members Erik Bottcher, Keith Powers, and others. Bottcher called it 'transformative,' promising fewer crashes and faster buses. Powers slammed the last-minute reversal. Safety analysts warn: canceling the busway preserves car dominance, discourages transit, and keeps streets unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. The project’s future is uncertain.

Streets grow less safe for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 7785, titled 'Relates to bus operation-related traffic regulations,' passed the Senate and Assembly in June 2025. The measure, sponsored by Senator Jamaal Bailey, excludes violations in cooperative housing developments with at least 10,000 Mitchell-Lama units from bus operation traffic regulations. The bill advanced through committee and received broad support in both chambers. By exempting these large complexes, the law weakens traffic enforcement where thousands live. This move increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, stripping away protections that save lives. Vulnerable road users lose another layer of safety in dense city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
