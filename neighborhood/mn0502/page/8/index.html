A bus bears down. The street swallows another life. In the past twelve months, <strong>six people died</strong> on Midtown-Times Square streets. <strong>Nine more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>408 injured, 752 crashes</strong> in a single year. Each one a story cut short, a body broken, a family left waiting for a call that never comes.</p><p><strong>SUVs, taxis, bikes, and buses</strong> all play their part. The old and the young are not spared. A woman, 83, crossing with the signal, struck and killed by an SUV turning left at 58th and Sixth. Two cyclists, both 67, dead after a collision with a parked SUV on Fifth Avenue. A 39-year-old man, not even in the roadway, killed by a bus and a boom lift on East 51st. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=promises-and-delays-from-city-hall>Promises and Delays from City Hall</h3><p>City leaders talk about safety. They promise change. Mayor Eric Adams calls Fifth Avenue a place where &ldquo;more people walk down the street every hour than fill Madison Square Garden during a sold-out Knicks game&rdquo; and says the city is &ldquo;finally making&mldr; a pedestrian paradise by making it more walkable, greener, and safer&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/manhattan/5th-avenue-redesign-2028/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city will spend $400 million to widen sidewalks and plant trees. But the plan skips bus lanes and bike lanes. Riders Alliance calls it out: &ldquo;Two mayors have now disregarded city workers&rsquo; plans for a busway, throwing riders under the bus to favor luxury boutiques&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>said Danny Pearlstein</a>.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians make up 70% of Fifth Avenue traffic but get less than half the space.</strong> Buses crawl. Cyclists dodge doors and trucks. The city claims progress, but the most vulnerable are still left in the street.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down plan, every missing lane is a choice. The dead cannot speak. The living must. <strong>Call your council member. Demand bus lanes, bike lanes, and real protection for people on foot and on wheels.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

The bill, debated on December 12, 2024, sits before the City Council. It would require all e-mobility devices not covered by the state DMV to register with the city’s Department of Transportation. The bill’s summary states it aims to increase accountability for e-bike riders after fatal crashes. Holden, the sponsor, cited dangers from unregulated e-vehicles and hit-and-runs. Advocacy groups, including Los Deliveristas Unidos and Open Plans, argue the bill would unfairly criminalize immigrants and delivery workers, and increase police stops for people of color. The NYC Hospitality Alliance warns of new financial and administrative burdens for small businesses.

The event, held during the third annual Fifth Avenue Holiday Open Street, made the avenue car-free between 48th and 57th Streets. The $150 million plan, as described by Madelyn Wils, will reduce traffic lanes from five to three and widen sidewalks between Bryant Park and Central Park. Powers and other officials voiced strong support for prioritizing pedestrians, echoing Levine’s call to 'do better here' and make Fifth Avenue a true pedestrian destination. The redesign aims to reclaim space for people, not cars, and signals a shift toward safer, more vibrant streets for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The council moves to change that.</p><p class=mb3>Bill details: City Council legislative proposal on sidewalk shed reform, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers (District 4) and others. The bill is under council review as of December 10, 2024. The measure seeks to overhaul regulations that force NYCHA to keep up over 400 sidewalk sheds—spanning 25 miles—often long after repairs finish. The matter summary states, 'reforming parts of the city’s broader shedding regulations that are a poor fit for NYCHA and a nuisance citywide.' Powers and co-sponsor Erik Bottcher aim to reduce shed length, extend inspection cycles, and allow more art and color on scaffolds. Jamie Rubin, NYCHA board head, supports the bill, noting that current rules rob residents of sunlight, safety, and outdoor space. The bill promises to remove unnecessary sheds, reclaim millions in wasted funds, and improve daily life for public housing residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike.

The Fifth Avenue Association blamed security around Trump Tower. The matter summary reads: 'City scales back hugely popular Fifth Ave. Holiday Open Street despite sales boosts.' Council Member Keith Powers called the move 'surprising' and urged a full return next year. Advocates called it 'frustrating and disappointing.' Mayor Adams had previously praised the program, which boosted sales by $3 million in 2023. The Department of Transportation now touts sidewalk expansion, but the new redesign drops a planned bike lane and may slow buses. Pedestrians and cyclists lose space.
