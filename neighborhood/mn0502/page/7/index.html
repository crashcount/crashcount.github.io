A bus bears down. The street swallows another life. In the past twelve months, <strong>six people died</strong> on Midtown-Times Square streets. <strong>Nine more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>408 injured, 752 crashes</strong> in a single year. Each one a story cut short, a body broken, a family left waiting for a call that never comes.</p><p><strong>SUVs, taxis, bikes, and buses</strong> all play their part. The old and the young are not spared. A woman, 83, crossing with the signal, struck and killed by an SUV turning left at 58th and Sixth. Two cyclists, both 67, dead after a collision with a parked SUV on Fifth Avenue. A 39-year-old man, not even in the roadway, killed by a bus and a boom lift on East 51st. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=promises-and-delays-from-city-hall>Promises and Delays from City Hall</h3><p>City leaders talk about safety. They promise change. Mayor Eric Adams calls Fifth Avenue a place where &ldquo;more people walk down the street every hour than fill Madison Square Garden during a sold-out Knicks game&rdquo; and says the city is &ldquo;finally making&mldr; a pedestrian paradise by making it more walkable, greener, and safer&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/manhattan/5th-avenue-redesign-2028/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city will spend $400 million to widen sidewalks and plant trees. But the plan skips bus lanes and bike lanes. Riders Alliance calls it out: &ldquo;Two mayors have now disregarded city workers&rsquo; plans for a busway, throwing riders under the bus to favor luxury boutiques&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>said Danny Pearlstein</a>.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians make up 70% of Fifth Avenue traffic but get less than half the space.</strong> Buses crawl. Cyclists dodge doors and trucks. The city claims progress, but the most vulnerable are still left in the street.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down plan, every missing lane is a choice. The dead cannot speak. The living must. <strong>Call your council member. Demand bus lanes, bike lanes, and real protection for people on foot and on wheels.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
