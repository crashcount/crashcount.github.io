Ten dead. Thirty seriously hurt. Over 1,200 injured since 2022. The toll does not slow. It grinds on, day after day, year after year.</p><p>Just last week, a van crashed near 42nd and 10th. Police found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline inside. A woman and a child sat in the parked car the runaway food cart struck. Both went to the hospital. The driver faces charges for reckless endangerment and fire code violations. Firefighters <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers</a>, the report said. The street could have gone up in flames.</p><p>A day later, a city worker fixing a street sign was slashed by a cyclist after a near-miss. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo;</a>. The worker bled in the street. The assailant fled. No arrests.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-rest>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Rest</h3><p>SUVs and cars did the worst. Four killed by SUVs. One by a bus. One by a taxi. The rest by bikes, mopeds, and trucks. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-delays-and-the-cost-of-waiting>Leadership: Votes, Delays, and the Cost of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders have acted. Assembly Member Tony Simone and Senator Liz Krueger both <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">voted to extend school speed zones and back speed cameras</a>. Krueger <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. But the city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. Council Member Keith Powers <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>called for using idle congestion pricing cameras for enforcement</a>, but the equipment sits unused. The city moves slow. The street moves fast.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>Every day of delay is another day of blood. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.

Introduced by Councilman Oswald Feliz (District 15) on November 27, 2022. The measure responds to at least 140 e-bike battery fires in 2022, with six deaths and 140 injuries. Feliz said, 'We must ensure that products sold in our city are safe for New Yorkers.' The bill restricts uncertified batteries and supports FDNY’s education campaign. The bulletin warns tenants about the dangers of charging and storing e-bike batteries at home. State Senator Liz Krueger also pushes for tighter battery regulations. The council’s action targets a growing threat to vulnerable residents—delivery workers and tenants—who face deadly fires in their homes and workplaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The push follows prior years when two crosstown blocks were closed to cars to protect pedestrians. The matter, described as 'NYC pols push Eric Adams to bring back Rockefeller Center holiday street closures,' highlights the risk: 'The crowds are just enormous... it’s frankly unsafe to have tourists pushed off the sidewalk and stepping into traffic.' Powers and Levine sent a letter on November 1 but received no response. Powers said, 'The crowds are crushing and demand is overflowing.' Both officials support making the closures permanent to prevent pedestrians from being forced into traffic during peak tourist season.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
