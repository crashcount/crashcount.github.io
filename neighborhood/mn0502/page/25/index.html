A bus bears down. The street swallows another life. In the past twelve months, <strong>six people died</strong> on Midtown-Times Square streets. <strong>Nine more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>408 injured, 752 crashes</strong> in a single year. Each one a story cut short, a body broken, a family left waiting for a call that never comes.</p><p><strong>SUVs, taxis, bikes, and buses</strong> all play their part. The old and the young are not spared. A woman, 83, crossing with the signal, struck and killed by an SUV turning left at 58th and Sixth. Two cyclists, both 67, dead after a collision with a parked SUV on Fifth Avenue. A 39-year-old man, not even in the roadway, killed by a bus and a boom lift on East 51st. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=promises-and-delays-from-city-hall>Promises and Delays from City Hall</h3><p>City leaders talk about safety. They promise change. Mayor Eric Adams calls Fifth Avenue a place where &ldquo;more people walk down the street every hour than fill Madison Square Garden during a sold-out Knicks game&rdquo; and says the city is &ldquo;finally making&mldr; a pedestrian paradise by making it more walkable, greener, and safer&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/manhattan/5th-avenue-redesign-2028/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city will spend $400 million to widen sidewalks and plant trees. But the plan skips bus lanes and bike lanes. Riders Alliance calls it out: &ldquo;Two mayors have now disregarded city workers&rsquo; plans for a busway, throwing riders under the bus to favor luxury boutiques&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>said Danny Pearlstein</a>.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians make up 70% of Fifth Avenue traffic but get less than half the space.</strong> Buses crawl. Cyclists dodge doors and trucks. The city claims progress, but the most vulnerable are still left in the street.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down plan, every missing lane is a choice. The dead cannot speak. The living must. <strong>Call your council member. Demand bus lanes, bike lanes, and real protection for people on foot and on wheels.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates and officials back the move but call it timid. No wider sidewalks. No hardened protection. Paint and plastic mark the limits. Pedestrians and cyclists still face risk.</p><p class=mb3>On October 18, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation presented a redesign for Third Avenue, reviewed by Community Board 8's Transportation Committee. The plan, echoing a 2010 First Avenue project, repurposes 23 feet for cyclists and bus riders between E. 59th and E. 96th streets. Council Member Keith Powers and Borough President Mark Levine endorsed the proposal, with Levine stating, 'The redesign’s commitment to expanded protected bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes will turn this particularly dangerous stretch of the roadway into a safer, more efficient, and forward-thinking artery.' Still, Levine and advocates like Anna Melendez (Transportation Alternatives) pressed for more: wider sidewalks, hardened pedestrian islands, and real physical protection. The plan uses only paint and plastic, leaving pedestrians exposed. The proposal faces a full board vote on October 19, 2022. The city calls it a start, but the danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in the Board’s Transportation Committee, would convert two of five northbound car lanes into a dedicated bus lane and a parking-protected bike lane, with new pedestrian islands and signal priority. The committee voted 12-1 in favor. Councilmember Keith Powers, representing District 4, supports the overhaul. A spokesperson said, 'This project will expedite commute times, improve pedestrian safety, increase spaces for bikes, and ensure that cars, buses, and bikes can share the road in harmony.' Third Avenue is a Vision Zero priority corridor, scarred by six pedestrian and one cyclist death since 2016. Hundreds of cyclists ride here daily, despite no bike lane. Residents urged swift, bold action. DOT aims to install improvements in 2023.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan marks the Adams administration's first major street project. The current avenue, with seven northbound car lanes, has seen 703 crashes, one pedestrian death, and 198 injuries since 2019. The matter summary calls for 'reallocation of street space, prioritizing cycling, walking, and public transit over cars.' Advocates like Kate Fillin-Yeh (NACTO) and Paul Krikler (Community Board 8) urge protected bike lanes, busways, and wider sidewalks. Krikler says, 'We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely.' Transportation Alternatives and Community Board 6 echo these demands. The redesign aims to shift space from cars to people, following models like Paris's Rue de Rivoli. The panel's response will shape the future of vulnerable road user safety on Third Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Marijuana Regulation & Taxation Act passed in March 2021. The state now faces a gap: 'there are concerns of increased incidences of driving while impaired after cannabis use,' the Department of Health said. Senator Liz Krueger, a key architect, stated, 'Revenue from our legalized system will be used to pay these ongoing costs.' The Department of Health seeks new technology to detect cannabis impairment, as no standard test exists. Nearly 400 officers are trained as drug recognition experts, with thousands more in training. Critics warn DWI issues should have been solved before legalization.

The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition.

The resolution followed the death of 28-year-old cyclist Carling Mott, killed by a truck driver on E. 85th Street. The matter, described as a push to 'bring safe bike routes to the neighborhood,' saw support from councilmembers Keith Powers and Julie Menin, who called on DOT to revisit the 85th Street lane and improve safety infrastructure. Advocates and residents backed the plan, demanding action to prevent more deaths. DOT is reviewing the location for possible upgrades. The board's vote renews a fight stalled since 2016 by political opposition.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Activists from StreetsPAC and Transportation Alternatives criticized the delay, noting that streets near schools are especially dangerous for children, particularly in Black and brown neighborhoods.
