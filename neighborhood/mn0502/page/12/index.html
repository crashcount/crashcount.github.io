Ten dead. Thirty seriously hurt. Over 1,200 injured since 2022. The toll does not slow. It grinds on, day after day, year after year.</p><p>Just last week, a van crashed near 42nd and 10th. Police found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline inside. A woman and a child sat in the parked car the runaway food cart struck. Both went to the hospital. The driver faces charges for reckless endangerment and fire code violations. Firefighters <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers</a>, the report said. The street could have gone up in flames.</p><p>A day later, a city worker fixing a street sign was slashed by a cyclist after a near-miss. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo;</a>. The worker bled in the street. The assailant fled. No arrests.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-rest>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Rest</h3><p>SUVs and cars did the worst. Four killed by SUVs. One by a bus. One by a taxi. The rest by bikes, mopeds, and trucks. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-delays-and-the-cost-of-waiting>Leadership: Votes, Delays, and the Cost of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders have acted. Assembly Member Tony Simone and Senator Liz Krueger both <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">voted to extend school speed zones and back speed cameras</a>. Krueger <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. But the city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. Council Member Keith Powers <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>called for using idle congestion pricing cameras for enforcement</a>, but the equipment sits unused. The city moves slow. The street moves fast.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>Every day of delay is another day of blood. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.

The bill states: “prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.” Council Member Erik D. Bottcher leads, joined by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and over two dozen co-sponsors. The law orders the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections each year, up from 100. The city must also run outreach and education. The bill aims to keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike. No more hiding behind parked cars.

The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when a 2017 Ford SUV traveling north struck her at the center front end. The report cites 'View Obstructed/Limited' as a contributing factor, indicating the driver’s impaired visibility played a critical role. The pedestrian sustained a contusion and injury to her hip and upper leg but remained conscious. The report also notes 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor, but the primary cause centers on the driver’s limited view. The SUV showed no vehicle damage, and the driver was licensed.

Cars return. Pedestrians lose ground. Advocates and lawmakers protest. Sales soared last year. Now, the city cites security. Sidewalks may widen, but bike lanes vanish. Buses slow. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>""This is something we should be doing every year across the month of the December, it’s such an easy win for the area in Midtown,"" -- Keith Powers</p><p class=mb3>On December 4, 2024, the Adams administration cut the Fifth Avenue holiday Open Street program in Midtown from three Sundays to just one, shrinking the car-free zone to December 8 between 48th and 55th streets. The Fifth Avenue Association blamed security around Trump Tower. The matter summary reads: 'City scales back hugely popular Fifth Ave. Holiday Open Street despite sales boosts.' Council Member Keith Powers called the move 'surprising' and urged a full return next year. Advocates called it 'frustrating and disappointing.' Mayor Adams had previously praised the program, which boosted sales by $3 million in 2023. The Department of Transportation now touts sidewalk expansion, but the new redesign drops a planned bike lane and may slow buses. Pedestrians and cyclists lose space. The city’s retreat keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The injured driver was wearing a lap belt and was not ejected from the vehicle. The impact point was the center back end of the struck vehicle and the center front end of the striking vehicle.

The motorcycle had two occupants: a 22-year-old male driver and a 17-year-old female passenger. Both were wearing helmets, as noted under 'safety equipment,' but sustained injuries including abrasions and trauma to the knee, lower leg, foot, and elbow areas. The report explicitly cites 'Pavement Defective' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors, highlighting driver error in speed choice and hazardous road conditions. Neither occupant was ejected, and both remained conscious. The crash caused damage to the motorcycle's center front end.
