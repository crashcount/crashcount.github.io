Since 2022, this small slice of Manhattan logged <strong>10 deaths and 1,397 injuries</strong> in 2,721 crashes. Pedestrians and cyclists carry the pain. SUVs and cars do most of the harm. The hours blur, but the damage peaks through the day and into the night.</p><h3 id=crosswalks-as-crime-scenes>Crosswalks as crime scenes</h3><ul><li>At 7th Avenue and West 36th, a driver going straight hit a 34‑year‑old man in the crosswalk. He died there. The report lists distraction. The SUV had no listed damage. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data records it</a>.</li><li>On Avenue of the Americas at West 58th, a Mazda SUV made a left and struck an 83‑year‑old woman crossing with the signal. She died. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash file shows it</a>.</li></ul><p>Six pedestrians have been killed here since 2022. Another 488 were hurt. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>The rollup is clear</a>. SUVs are tied to four pedestrian deaths.</p><blockquote><p>“Demand for curb space in the city is increasing, from trash collection and bike lanes to truck loading and parking.” <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/new-digital-parking-system-on-the-uws-implemented-in-dead-of-night-DG4954621>NYC DOT said</a>.

These tools match the failure modes listed: left turns, failure to yield, distraction.</li><li>Work the repeat hotspots weekly: Avenue of the Americas, West 51st, West 42nd, 7th Avenue. Keep counters on the ground until the injury numbers drop.</li><li>Trucks and buses cause fewer cases than cars here, but their strikes maim. Tighten turns and give buses protected approaches on the worst blocks.</li></ul><h3 id=the-citywide-brakes-we-still-dont-use>The citywide brakes we still don’t use</h3><p>Albany gave the city the keys to slow streets. The Council and Mayor can set <strong>20 mph</strong> on local roads. They haven’t used it. Our own page lays it out and gives you the numbers to call. <a href=/take_action/>Act on it here</a>.</p><p>The state is moving on repeat speeders. The Senate advanced the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> to force speed limiters on drivers who rack up points or camera tickets. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Committee votes passed</a>. The Assembly has a matching push. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>See A2299</a>. These are the drivers who turn people into names on a sheet.</p><blockquote><p>“We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” the city’s traffic chief said of Canal Street after two people were killed by a car going over 100 mph. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>The quote is here</a>. One street moved after two deaths. Midtown’s list is longer.</p></blockquote><h3 id=use-the-tools>Use the tools</h3><p>Lower the default speed. Install limiters on the worst repeat speeders. Daylight and harden every deadly turn. Then check the numbers. If they don’t fall, do more.</p><p>If you want this to stop, start with one call. <a href=/take_action/>Ask the city to set 20 mph and back the speed‑limiter bill</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, district 35, formally objected to the unfunded capital plan with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. Their joint letter blocked the plan’s January 1 start, forcing negotiations. Governor Hochul, who backs the $68 billion plan, promised no income tax hikes but left other taxes and fees on the table. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called for transparency. The MTA’s future—and the safety of those who rely on it—hangs in the balance.

The bill summary states: 'My legislation will require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years.' Simone urges the use of congestion pricing revenue for these safety upgrades, arguing, 'No priority is higher on any rider's mind, including mine, than safety on the system.'
