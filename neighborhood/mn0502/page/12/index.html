A bus bears down. The street swallows another life. In the past twelve months, <strong>six people died</strong> on Midtown-Times Square streets. <strong>Nine more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>408 injured, 752 crashes</strong> in a single year. Each one a story cut short, a body broken, a family left waiting for a call that never comes.</p><p><strong>SUVs, taxis, bikes, and buses</strong> all play their part. The old and the young are not spared. A woman, 83, crossing with the signal, struck and killed by an SUV turning left at 58th and Sixth. Two cyclists, both 67, dead after a collision with a parked SUV on Fifth Avenue. A 39-year-old man, not even in the roadway, killed by a bus and a boom lift on East 51st. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=promises-and-delays-from-city-hall>Promises and Delays from City Hall</h3><p>City leaders talk about safety.

The city will spend $400 million to widen sidewalks and plant trees. But the plan skips bus lanes and bike lanes.

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.

The event capped years of transformation, turning a block once 'full of cars and trucks' into a car-free space. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, Assembly Member Tony Simone, and Council Member Erik Bottcher attended the ribbon-cutting. Levine recalled, 'I remember the battle over transforming this space and all the people who said that it would clog up traffic all over Midtown if we turned this street over to people and here we are and it's gorgeous.' Vornado Realty Trust funded the $65-million project with the Department of Transportation. The plaza, now permanent, offers 16,000 square feet for pedestrians, with trees, seating, and public programming. The change removes cars from a busy Midtown block, giving vulnerable road users safe, open ground.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bicyclist sustained abrasions to his elbow, lower arm, and hand but was conscious and not ejected. The report lists unspecified contributing factors but does not specify any driver errors or victim behaviors. The driver of the sedan was licensed and operating the vehicle going straight ahead. The crash highlights the danger of vehicle-bike interactions in Manhattan’s busy streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, titled "$500M of taxpayer dough wasted? Hochul, MTA lack Plan B for NYC congestion pricing infrastructure," highlights the lack of contingency plans from the MTA and Governor Hochul. Councilman Keith Powers (District 4), a supporter of congestion pricing, called for repurposing the equipment for red-light, speed, and noise camera enforcement, and tracking vehicles with fake or obscured plates. Critics, including Vito Fosella and Joe Borelli, questioned the process and future use of the equipment. The indefinite pause leaves the MTA’s capital projects unfunded and vulnerable road users exposed, as enforcement tools sit idle and no alternative safety measures are in place.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'

Assembly Member Robert Carroll and business leader Kathy Wylde criticized the governor’s floated payroll tax hike as unfair to city businesses.

The bill’s summary warns: 'No plan B for transit investments should congestion pricing not go through.' Senator Liz Krueger, mentioned in the debate, criticized the lack of alternative funding, saying, 'She is not aware of what she is referring to or where she believes that money will come from.' The delay leaves critical projects—like subway accessibility, new signals, and electric buses—unfunded. Without this money, vulnerable riders face more delays, breakdowns, and unsafe conditions.

Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
