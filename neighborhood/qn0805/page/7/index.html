A six-year-old, her head cut open in the back seat. These are not accidents. They are the price paid for speed, for inaction, for streets built for cars, not people.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit still stands higher on most streets. Intersections have been redesigned, but not enough. The city says one death is too many. The city keeps counting.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> They can push for lower speed limits. They can demand more cameras, more protected crossings, more space for people. They can fight for every inch of safety. Or they can wait for the next crash.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Call your council member.

Borelli (District 51) joined seventeen other lawmakers in a federal lawsuit to block New York City’s $15 congestion pricing toll for Midtown Manhattan. The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation.

Eight new routes. More frequent service for thousands. Stops spaced farther apart. Most riders keep their stops. Councilmember Brooks-Powers doubts gains for her district. Borough President Richards backs the plan. Rollout not before 2025.</p><p class=mb3>The MTA’s Queens Bus Network Redesign, announced December 12, 2023, proposes $30 million in service upgrades and expands local routes from 83 to 91. The plan, under review since 2020, aims to boost 10-minute-or-better service for 200,000 more residents, raising coverage from 60.1% to 68.9%. The official summary states the redesign will 'streamline and speed up service.' Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers voiced 'serious concerns' about disadvantages for her district, especially with congestion pricing. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, once critical, now supports the draft after public outreach. State Senator Leroy Comrie noted Brooks-Powers wants clarity for her community, not outright rejection. The redesign awaits further input and is expected no sooner than 2025. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
