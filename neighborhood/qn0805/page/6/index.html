A six-year-old, her head cut open in the back seat. These are not accidents. They are the price paid for speed, for inaction, for streets built for cars, not people.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit still stands higher on most streets. Intersections have been redesigned, but not enough. The city says one death is too many. The city keeps counting.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> They can push for lower speed limits. They can demand more cameras, more protected crossings, more space for people. They can fight for every inch of safety. Or they can wait for the next crash.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Call your council member.

The matter reads: 'Resolution calling on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to ban e-bikes from the New York City subway system and produce an annual report on the enforcement actions that the MTA takes on e-bikes in the system.' Council Members James F. Gennaro (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, and Farah N. Louis back the measure. The bill responds to a spike in lithium-ion battery fires, but it also blocks a vital route for delivery workers and cyclists.

The bill would require commercial e-bikes to be registered and display visible license information. Employers, not delivery workers, would be fined for violations like sidewalk riding. The council frames this as a way to identify dangerous vehicles and hold companies accountable, aiming to reduce injuries and deaths among pedestrians and cyclists. The measure remains under committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Resolution urges Albany to add e-bikes. The measure targets hit-and-runs that leave victims behind. It sits in the Transportation Committee. Lawmakers want accountability when vulnerable road users are struck.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0231-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced March 7, 2024. The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.1679/S.561. The matter title states it aims to 'increase the penalty for leaving the scene of an accident involving an e-scooter and further calling upon the NYS Legislature to include e-bikes in such legislation.' Council Members James F. Gennaro (primary sponsor, District 24) and Gale A. Brewer (co-sponsor, District 6) put their names to the measure. The bill would raise penalties for fleeing e-scooter crashes from a violation to a Class-A misdemeanor, and for more serious cases, to a Class-E felony. The resolution also urges lawmakers to include e-bikes. The council’s action seeks to close loopholes and ensure drivers who harm vulnerable road users face consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets wait.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0244-2024, sponsored by Council Member James F. Gennaro, was introduced on March 7, 2024, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution urges the New York State Legislature to 'adopt the same exemptions as FMCSA for approved digital mirror systems with respect to operation in intrastate commerce.' The federal FMCSA allows digital mirror systems in place of traditional mirrors for interstate trucks, citing improved field of vision and blind spot elimination. New York State does not yet allow these systems for trucks operating only within the state. Gennaro’s action aims to align state law with federal safety standards, which the FMCSA says may offer equal or greater safety than old mirrors. The measure remains in committee, awaiting further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
