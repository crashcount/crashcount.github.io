A child is struck crossing with the signal. The street does not care. In Port Richmond, the numbers pile up. <strong>Since 2022, one person is dead, three are seriously hurt, and 303 have been injured in 640 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><p>Last year, a sedan hit a man crossing Post Avenue. He died at the intersection. The record shows: chest wounds, severe bleeding, killed while walking with the light. The car kept going. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>No child should be in danger just walking home.</strong> Yet in April, a four-year-old girl riding on a bike was hit by an SUV on Rector Street. She survived. Her scars will last. The driver kept going straight. The city kept talking about safety.</p><p>On May 11, police tried to stop a Nissan SUV for tinted windows. The driver sped off, crashed into a police car, and opened fire. &ldquo;The gunman smashed his Nissan into the police car and then opened fire on the vehicle, striking it but missing the officers inside&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/12/us-news/deranged-gunman-31-opens-fire-on-cops-while-fleeing-traffic-stop-in-nyc/>reported the New York Post</a>). Two officers were cut by glass. Two guns were found in the car. The SUV had 27 violations, five for speeding. The system let it roll.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>No council member, no local leader has stood in Port Richmond to say, “Enough.”</strong> The silence is loud. The laws are slow. The streets are fast.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now? Demand Action</h3><p><strong>The disaster is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put children before cars. If leaders will not act, replace them.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The case, rooted in the MTA’s lawsuit against the feds, remains unresolved. The DOT’s attorney, Dominika Tarczynska, said, "The Department of Transportation maintains the position that New York City should stop charging tolls by April 20." MTA attorney Robert Kaplan countered, "Congestion pricing is in effect, we believe it's working, and ... we don't intend to turn it off unless there's an order from your honor." Governor Hochul and the MTA refuse to comply. The federal government threatens vague consequences but takes no concrete steps. The MTA’s November agreement with the Biden-era DOT did not allow for unilateral federal withdrawal. As the legal fight drags on, congestion pricing continues. Streets south of 60th Street see fewer crashes. Bus speeds rise. Foot traffic grows. Vulnerable road users benefit while politicians bicker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed in the Transportation, Public Safety, Sanitation & Environment Committee, drew strong turnout. The meeting's summary: 'A large number of Lower Manhattan residents turned out to support the Canal Street open street, but organizers reduced the program's operating times in response to complaints from some residents.' Chairperson Vincent Cirrito said, 'This is an open space for our residents, for our kids... where they don’t have to worry about vehicles and cars.' Council Member Chris Marte and some residents pushed for further cutbacks, while others defended the open street as vital for safety, accessibility, and local business. The board sided with vulnerable road users, keeping two blocks of Canal Street open to people, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Shekar Krishnan criticized the mayor’s stance, saying, “It’s deeply misguided to cut funds from the open street program, especially at this moment.” The City Comptroller’s office also faulted the administration for poor planning.

The plan, not a council bill but a DOT action, covers a seven-mile route along Bailey Avenue, Sedgwick Avenue, Depot Place, Exterior Street, E. 135th Street, Lincoln Avenue, and Bruckner Boulevard. The DOT cited access issues with state and private landowners, abandoning Mayor Adams’s earlier promise of a true waterfront path. The official summary states: 'protected bike lanes on streets near the waterfront, rather than a true waterfront greenway.' Advocates like Chauncy Young and Laura Solis welcomed protected lanes but lamented the loss of a car-free riverside route. Mayor Adams claimed the project would help undo highway devastation in the Bronx. Still, the plan leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic, not shielded by water’s edge.

The letter urges, 'Mass transit must be federally funded at a level commensurate to its importance.' Stewart-Cousins, mentioned as a key signatory, previously rejected the capital plan due to a $35 billion shortfall. The group asks for $14 billion in federal support, up from $13 billion in the last plan.

The CBC’s Andrew Rein said, “We have to prioritize state-of-good-repair, basic modernization, and delay some of the system expansions.” The report warns that failing to fund maintenance will gut service, repeating past crises.

The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods.

The report, required by the City Council, reveals the city missed mandates for protected bike lanes (29.3 of 50 miles) and bus lanes (17.9 of 30 miles) for the third year running. The matter summary states: 'New York City has failed to meet legally required benchmarks for redesigning streets for bikes, buses, and pedestrians due to a lack of resources and political interference.' Mayor Eric Adams is named as the main obstacle. The report cites staff shortages, shrinking divisions, and political pushback—especially the mayor’s role in killing the Fordham Road busway. Former DOT commissioner Polly Trottenberg warned the plan needed more funding and a new approach. Advocates and officials say Adams’s lack of support left the city’s most vulnerable road users exposed. The law’s promise is broken. The streets stay deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in both Senate and Assembly one-house budgets, suggests new taxes: fees on online deliveries, higher payroll mobility taxes, and more surcharges on rideshare trips. The matter summary reads: 'Taxes to back the MTA? That is what some New York lawmakers are proposing.' Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key figure. Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie previously rejected the MTA’s $68.4 billion plan last December over funding gaps. The proposal has sparked public anger, with advocates and riders decrying more taxes. MTA chair Janno Lieber insists full funding is essential to keep trains and buses running safely.

The change, reported by Streetsblog NYC, limits car-free hours to Saturdays only from May to September—a 50 percent cut from last year’s already reduced schedule. The program, once a weekend staple from spring to fall, now faces its smallest footprint yet. Alex Morano, a volunteer organizer, called the rollback 'really unfortunate,' stressing the street’s value to the neighborhood. Saskia Haegens, Chair of the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Corporation, urged full city funding, saying the program is 'transformative.' Organizers blame insufficient city support, with less than half the cost covered this year. The Department of Transportation claims $10 million in annual support and promises a permanent redesign, but for now, cars win back space.
