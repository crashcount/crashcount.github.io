He was taken to Richmond University Medical Center in critical condition with a head injury (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><p>Since Jan 1, 2022, Port Richmond has recorded <strong>735 crashes</strong>, with <strong>364 people injured</strong> and <strong>1 person killed</strong>, according to city data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-corner-keeps-taking>The corner keeps taking</h3><p>Castleton Avenue leads the injury count here. City records show <strong>33 injuries</strong> and <strong>one serious injury</strong> on that corridor in the period covered (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The worst outcome in this neighborhood came at 974 Post Avenue on Jul 2, 2023, when a turning Audi sedan struck a man in the crosswalk; he died at the scene (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash record, ID 4642632</a>).</p><p>Injuries spike around the evening rush. The 5 PM hour logged <strong>31 injuries</strong>, with high counts at 6 PM and 9 PM too, a pattern that repeats day after day in the data we reviewed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-the-records-say>What the records say</h3><p>Pedestrians are hit most often by sedans and SUVs in this area. The city’s rollup shows 58 pedestrian injuries and 1 death tied to those vehicle types during the span covered (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Named contributing factors include driver inattention and unsafe speed in the official reports, alongside many entries marked “unspecified.” The April 19, 2025 crash that injured a male pedestrian off Treadwell Avenue lists “unsafe speed” in the file (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash record, ID 4807098</a>).</p><h3 id=the-bus-the-boy-the-paper-trail>The bus, the boy, the paper trail</h3><p>Police said the moped went through a stop sign and hit the bus at Castleton and Park, and that the investigation is ongoing (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>). ABC7 reported the boy’s critical head injury; the bus operator and three passengers were not hurt (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7</a>). We note what is printed. The ledger of harm is larger.</p><h3 id=fix-the-street-slow-the-cars>Fix the street, slow the cars</h3><p>This neighborhood’s map is not a mystery. Castleton Avenue is a corridor of injury. Post Avenue has a death on the books. The fixes are standard: daylight corners, harden turns, give pedestrians a head start, and add real traffic-calming on the injury blocks. Target evening hours when the body count climbs. Enforce yielding and speeding at the known hot spots.</p><p>Citywide, the tools sit on the table. The Senate’s repeat speeder bill — <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a> — advanced in June; State Sen. Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton voted yes in committee (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). On speed cameras around schools, she voted no on reauthorization this summer, while Assembly Member Charles Fall voted yes (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog</a>).</p><h3 id=the-next-move-is-ours>The next move is ours</h3><p>Lowering speeds saves lives.

Politicians split. Riders left stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the MTA Board heard public testimony and political debate on the fallout from Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing, which was set to begin June 30. The meeting focused on the loss of funding for transit accessibility. The matter, described as 'New Yorkers decry loss of congestion pricing money for accessible transit to MTA Board,' drew sharp criticism from disability advocates and riders. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, representing District 23, praised the Governor’s pause, calling congestion pricing 'the wrong plan for my constituents.' The pause leaves a $15 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, halting upgrades like elevators and ramps at dozens of stations. Advocates warned that without this funding, disabled New Yorkers, seniors, and veterans remain shut out of the subway. The MTA faces a federal mandate to make 95% of stations accessible by 2055, but these projects now stall. Riders demanded action. Politicians offered little hope.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in the Municipal Services Committee, would force cars and taxis to turn off, leaving the lane for buses, trucks, and emergency vehicles. The matter summary notes, 'The Bx36 bus, which travels this corridor, is among the slowest in the Bronx, with speeds dropping to as low as 4.5 miles per hour.' Council Members Pierina Sanchez and Oswald Feliz, who represent the area, expressed cautious optimism and called for community engagement. Committee Chair Lucia Deng reported, 'There was zero pushback on the concept of busways or bus lanes.' The committee even pushed for a longer route.

No progress.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul reversed her support for Manhattan congestion pricing, indefinitely delaying tolls below 60th Street. The plan, once set to launch June 30, was halted after pressure from U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who feared electoral fallout. The matter, described as a move to 'indefinitely delay' tolls, drew criticism for its timing and impact. Hochul’s action, punctuated by a speech echoing toll critics, left the policy in limbo. Political consultants and union leaders, including @TwuSamuelsen, noted the decision failed to win votes or resolve the issue. The MTA confirmed the program’s pause in court. With no congestion pricing, New York’s streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. The delay means no reduction in car traffic, no new funding for transit, and no safety gains for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transit funding hangs in limbo. Liz Krueger says the tax lacks support. Riders and workers face uncertainty as lawmakers reject new burdens and demand fairer solutions.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, State Sen. Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hochul’s decision, made without legislative action, drew sharp criticism. Jumaane Williams, NYC Public Advocate, warned of 'irreparable harm to the city.' Natasha Elder of NYPIRG said, 'Gov. Hochul's decision to delay congestion pricing tells subway and bus riders they don't rank.' Advocates like the Tri-State Transportation Campaign called for 'bold, strong leadership.'

They’re falling behind on their Streets Plan [bike lane construction] targets so I would expect them to want to install every bit of protected bike lane they had already committed to."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On June 5, 2024, the Department of Transportation (DOT) reversed course on a two-year-old plan to build protected bike lanes in northeast Queens. The project, once set to connect schools with safe cycling routes, will now feature mostly unprotected lanes and sharrows along 46th Avenue. Only a small segment between Springfield Boulevard and Cloverdale Boulevard will have a protected lane in one direction. DOT cited the need to 'maintain current curbside activities,' meaning parking. Community Board 11 had opposed the original plan, and homeowners rallied with 'NO BIKE LANES' signs and an 800-signature petition. Advocates like Laura Shepard and Elizabeth Adams condemned the rollback, saying, 'We can't let politics get in the way of saving lives.' Ben Turner criticized the prioritization of parking over safety, noting most homes already have driveways.

Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities.

DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.'
