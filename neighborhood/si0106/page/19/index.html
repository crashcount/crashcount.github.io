A child is struck crossing with the signal. The street does not care. In Port Richmond, the numbers pile up. <strong>Since 2022, one person is dead, three are seriously hurt, and 303 have been injured in 640 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><p>Last year, a sedan hit a man crossing Post Avenue. He died at the intersection. The record shows: chest wounds, severe bleeding, killed while walking with the light. The car kept going. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>No child should be in danger just walking home.</strong> Yet in April, a four-year-old girl riding on a bike was hit by an SUV on Rector Street. She survived. Her scars will last. The driver kept going straight. The city kept talking about safety.</p><p>On May 11, police tried to stop a Nissan SUV for tinted windows. The driver sped off, crashed into a police car, and opened fire. &ldquo;The gunman smashed his Nissan into the police car and then opened fire on the vehicle, striking it but missing the officers inside&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/12/us-news/deranged-gunman-31-opens-fire-on-cops-while-fleeing-traffic-stop-in-nyc/>reported the New York Post</a>). Two officers were cut by glass. Two guns were found in the car. The SUV had 27 violations, five for speeding. The system let it roll.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>No council member, no local leader has stood in Port Richmond to say, “Enough.”</strong> The silence is loud. The laws are slow. The streets are fast.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now? Demand Action</h3><p><strong>The disaster is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put children before cars. If leaders will not act, replace them.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

It allocates $369 billion to decarbonize sectors like power plants and HVAC, aiming for a 40% emissions cut by 2030. The bill continues the $7,500 federal EV tax credit and adds a $4,000 credit for used EVs, but omits dedicated funding for electric transit, freight, or e-bikes. Advocates like Yonah Freemark, David Zipper, and Noa Banayan criticize the focus on large electric SUVs and trucks, calling them dangerous for people outside cars. Zipper says, “We’re actually inducing people to buy heavier, more dangerous electric automobiles.” The bill introduces a $3.4 billion Neighborhood Equity and Access Grant, but skips high-speed rail and transit. Advocates urge more action, warning that the bill leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency projects only 74% of pre-pandemic riders will return by 2024, leaving a $4 billion revenue gap through 2026. The matter summary warns, 'Without a new funding stream, the MTA faces a fiscal cliff after 2023.' MTA Chief Financial Officer Kevin Willens urged state legislators to act, saying, 'If we start working together and start solving the deficit by 2023, we can lower the fiscal cliff by a billion dollars a year.' Advocates like Rachael Fauss criticized the state's gas-tax holiday, arguing it incentivized driving over transit funding. State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli warned of looming service changes. The bill is not tied to a specific council number or committee, but the call for recurring, dedicated state revenue is clear. Without intervention, vulnerable transit riders face reduced service and higher fares, deepening the city's transportation divide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DiNapoli opposes service cuts and supports realigning schedules to match shifting demand, especially off-peak and weekends. MTA Chief External Relations John McCarthy echoed the need for a post-COVID plan. The report stresses that mass transit is essential for New Yorkers.

DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, "DOT is proud to build on the success of our Open Streets with proposals to formalize spaces like the Doyers Open Street as a permanent pedestrian plaza." Wellington Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership, praised the move, calling it "healthier and safer for both shopkeepers and customers." The plan includes new plaza features and changes to nearby parking for commercial loading. The effort is part of a broader city push, with BIDs leading similar projects across New York.

The move left cyclists without a key route to upstate destinations and the Empire State Trail. The matter, described as 'an unexpected blow to cyclists statewide,' drew sharp criticism. Senator Tim Kennedy, chair of the state Senate Transportation Committee, urged Amtrak to reverse the decision and expand bike services. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt called the cut symptomatic of a national failure to support sustainable transit. Amtrak cited equipment needs for longer trips but gave no date for restoring service.

The article states: 'New York State residents continued to drive heavily despite high gas prices, with fuel consumption increasing from March to May 2022.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance slams the tax holiday as 'an outrageous windfall for oil profiteers' and warns it deprives New Yorkers of essential services. The article ties increased driving to sprawl and transit neglect, noting, 'Decades of sprawl planning and disinvestment in transit has made it more difficult to get around without a car—at a cost of our lungs, our bodies and our planet.' The surge in driving means more road deaths, more congestion, and more pollution. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—face greater danger as car dependency deepens.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal follows community workshops where residents demanded safer, people-first streets and dedicated loading zones. DOT will close the northern-most block of Underhill to cars, add two-way bike lanes, and install pinch-points to slow drivers. On Vanderbilt, sharrows become painted bike lanes, and new pedestrian islands and turn lanes will protect cyclists and walkers. DOT hopes to begin construction in the fall and is reviewing the neighborhood for further changes.

The project, part of the Streets Master Plan, faces committee review and community outreach through summer and fall, with implementation not expected before 2023. DOT Director of Bus Priority Kyle Gebhart said, “Everything is on the table.” The agency’s data shows slow buses and high rates of pedestrian and cyclist injuries. The plan divides the corridor into three segments for tailored solutions, including curbside and center-running bus lanes, transit signal priority, and busways. Some business groups voiced anger over possible parking loss, but transit advocates countered that most shoppers do not drive. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein said, “Busways are great for business, bringing more customers from more neighborhoods more efficiently and affordably.” The project’s outcome will shape safety for thousands who walk, bike, and ride.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Trash bins take curb space once reserved for cars. Bags move off sidewalks. Pedestrians get room to walk. Rats lose cover. Some drivers grumble. Council Member Bottcher calls it progress. Streets change. Safety follows.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2022, the city launched the Clean Curbs residential pilot on West 45th Street between Ninth and Tenth avenues in Hells Kitchen. The Department of Sanitation will install several dozen rat-proof trash bins for building managers and superintendents to store garbage and recycling, moving bags off sidewalks and into curbside street lanes. The matter summary reads: 'Testing a rat-proof trash container... instead of on the sidewalk.' Council Member Erik Bottcher said he is 'thrilled that our district was the first to be chosen for this exciting advance,' calling it 'another important step.' The pilot takes parking space for bins, sparking complaints from drivers but clearing pedestrian paths. The city plans to expand the $1.3-million program to all five boroughs. Critics note the bins are small and collection methods unchanged, limiting scale. Still, the move marks a shift: less sidewalk trash, more space for people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
