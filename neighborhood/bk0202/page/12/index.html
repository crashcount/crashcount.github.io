The move falls short of the original goal but marks the largest growth since 1994. Advocates say cameras save lives. Debate continues over equity and coverage.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, the City Council passed a resolution urging the state to expand New York City's red light camera program from 150 to 600 intersections. The measure, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows internal debate and negotiation, with some members pushing for 1,325 intersections and others preferring fewer. The final number represents a four-fold increase, covering about 4 percent of city intersections. The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement. The Department of Transportation called the Council's action a critical step.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Eric Adams ordered DOT to scale it back after opposition, leaving only partial improvements. Restler accused the mayor of ignoring traffic experts and thousands of residents. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams called the city’s response 'unacceptable' and 'irresponsible.'

Council members and advocates demand urgency. The mayor and DOT hesitate. Traffic deaths mount. The city faces a choice: act fast or let danger linger on its streets.</p><p class=mb3>On May 3, 2024, the City Council debated a new policy allowing New York City to lower speed limits from 25 mph to 20 mph on most streets, following a recent state budget measure. The measure, discussed in committee, requires a Council vote for citywide changes and a six-month warning period for drivers. Kamillah Hanks (District 49) was mentioned in the debate. Assemblymember Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas stressed urgency, citing recent deaths. Brooklyn Councilmember Lincoln Restler pledged to push the measure forward. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives called for a citywide approach, not piecemeal action. The Department of Transportation thanked lawmakers but did not commit to a timeline. The debate highlights the tension between urgent safety needs and political delays. Vulnerable road users remain at risk until the city acts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A head-on crash between an SUV and a motorcycle. The rider’s lower leg crushed, helmet intact. SUV’s front left mangled. Both vehicles eastbound. Steel and flesh meet, the city absorbs the pain.</p><p class=mb3>A head-on collision between a motorcycle and an SUV unfolded near 181 York Street in Brooklyn at 6:55 p.m., according to the police report. The report states both vehicles were traveling east when they collided. The motorcycle rider, a 40-year-old man, remained conscious but suffered a crushed lower leg. His helmet stayed on. The SUV’s front left quarter panel was severely damaged. Police cite 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as the contributing factor, highlighting a systemic hazard where sudden, unpredictable roadway events can trigger violent impacts. No driver errors beyond this are listed in the report. The focus remains on the chain reaction that left a vulnerable rider injured, underscoring the persistent danger for those outside steel cages on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
