Eighteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past twelve months, 572 crashes tore through Downtown Brooklyn-Dumbo-Boerum Hill. The wounded are not numbers. A four-year-old struck in the crosswalk. A 74-year-old ejected from his e-bike, dead on Tillary Street. A woman, right rear passenger, crushed in a stopped SUV on Flatbush Avenue. The city keeps moving. The bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—42 incidents left pedestrians injured or worse. Buses, trucks, bikes, and motorcycles all played their part. Most of the injured were just crossing with the light. Some never made it to the other side.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-sayand-what-they-do>What Leaders Say—and What They Do</h2><p>After a mother and her two daughters were killed by a driver with a suspended license and a record of violations, State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said</a>, “It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act. The senselessness of this most recent crash is compounded by the fact that this car had dozens of speed and red light violations, and the driver had a suspended license.”</p><p>Assemblymember Emily Gallagher <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>put it plain</a>: “A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.”</p><p>The city has plans—<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/06/dot-proposes-protected-bike-lane-for-court-street-this-summer>protected bike lanes for Court Street</a>, narrower lanes to stop double parking. But the deaths keep coming. The bills stall. The cameras wait for reauthorization. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapses. The law lets the city lower speed limits, but the limit stays high.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, another family breaks. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

The driver’s failure to maintain distance caused the impact, leaving the cyclist bruised and conscious.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a sedan traveling south on Navy Street struck a bicyclist from behind at 9:15 PM. The bicyclist, a 38-year-old, was ejected from their bike and sustained head contusions, classified as injury severity level 3. The report cites the driver’s error as "Following Too Closely," which led to the right front bumper impacting the center back end of the bike. The bicyclist was conscious after the crash and suffered bruising but no further details on safety equipment were provided. No damage was recorded on either vehicle. The report explicitly identifies the driver’s failure to maintain a safe following distance as the primary cause, with no contributing factors attributed to the bicyclist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill aims to 'increase certain penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles,' targeting violations like loud engines, illegal claxons, and air horns. Council Member Sandra Ung leads as primary sponsor, joined by Bottcher, Lee, Brannan, Brewer, Vernikov, Zhuang, Gennaro, Won, Louis, Restler, and the Manhattan Borough President. The bill would raise fines for both light and heavy vehicles. It was referred to committee on the day of introduction. No vote has been held. The measure addresses noise but does not directly tackle the physical dangers cars pose to pedestrians and cyclists. Vulnerable road users still face the same risks from traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT had pledged completion in late 2023, but the project remains stalled with no timeline. Ossé stated, 'They brought this to the community board and there was an outpouring of support for this protected bike lane.' The matter was discussed with Community Boards 3 and 8, and local officials, schools, and businesses support the project. Council Member Lincoln Restler accused Mayor Adams of putting politics over public safety, saying, 'Mayor Adams has decided that he cares more about who he thinks is going to vote for him in 2025 than our lives.' The delay leaves cyclists exposed to ongoing danger, with injuries on the rise. The DOT’s call for more 'community engagement' is seen as a smokescreen for inaction. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'G train summer shutdown: ‘Czar’ will oversee service disruptions amid repairs, MTA says,' focused on the MTA's plan to centralize shutdown management and upgrade the G's ancient signals to modern CBTC technology. Restler pressed for action from the Department of Transportation, which failed to meet legal bus lane construction benchmarks last year, building only 5.2 of the required 30 miles. DOT did not respond. The shutdown will hit Greenpoint and other neighborhoods hard, leaving vulnerable riders at the mercy of slow, crowded buses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler declared, 'We need much stricter oversight of the private sanitation and construction truck companies that are operating in New York City.'
