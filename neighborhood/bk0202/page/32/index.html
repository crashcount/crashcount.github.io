The senselessness of this most recent crash is compounded by the fact that this car had dozens of speed and red light violations, and the driver had a suspended license.”</p><p>Assemblymember Emily Gallagher <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>put it plain</a>: “A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.”</p><p>The city has plans—<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/06/dot-proposes-protected-bike-lane-for-court-street-this-summer>protected bike lanes for Court Street</a>, narrower lanes to stop double parking. But the deaths keep coming. The bills stall. The cameras wait for reauthorization. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapses. The law lets the city lower speed limits, but the limit stays high.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, another family breaks. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

The event, organized by the Department of Transportation, aimed to gather community feedback on the deteriorating structure. The city promised a new concept by spring 2023 and construction by mid-2026. Restler criticized the process, saying, 'this community will not accept a status quo repair of a Robert Moses relic. We need a bold 21st century climate-oriented solution.' Residents echoed his frustration, pushing for innovative ideas like a ground-level roadway covered by parkland or a tunnel for trucks. The meeting lacked a public Q&amp;A, fueling skepticism about genuine engagement. The city pledged more meetings and collaboration as plans develop.

The bill, not yet voted on or assigned a committee, would give informants 25% of each $175 ticket. Restler writes, 'Turning citizens into vigilantes with a profit incentive...is not the right way.' He argues the bill creates perverse incentives, strips due process, and could trap low-income New Yorkers in debt. Restler supports protected bike lanes as a proven safety measure, noting, 'New York City recently installed more protected bike lanes, and subsequently saw a decrease in pedestrian deaths.' He urges the city to keep enforcement out of private hands and focus on systemic fixes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler, the sole sponsor, said, 'Too many parents with strollers, people in wheelchairs and bicyclists face unsafe conditions every day because of sidewalks and bike lanes obstructed by illegal parking.' The bill would empower the Department of Transportation to enlist civilians to flag violators, with a 25% share of fines as reward.
