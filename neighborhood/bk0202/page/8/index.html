Flatbush grinds. Atlantic does not forgive.</p><p>A 74‑year‑old man on an e‑bike died when a bus made a right at Tillary and Jay. The city record lists “E‑Bike” and “Bus.” It lists “Ejected.” It lists “Apparent Death.” The time was 8:15 p.m. on Nov. 6, 2024. The place was here. The turn was right. The man did not get up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash log</a>).</p><p>At Flatbush Avenue and State Street, a 45‑year‑old woman riding in the back seat was killed. The SUV was stopped in traffic. A sedan came straight. She died at 11:04 p.m. on Feb. 28, 2025. The sheet says “Crush Injuries.” It says “Apparent Death” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash log</a>).</p><p>The rest live, but hurt. Since 2022, this area logged 2,231 crashes, 1,005 injuries, and two deaths. Pedestrians: 183 hurt. Cyclists: 166 hurt. People in cars: 616 hurt. Heavy vehicles did their share: trucks and buses are tied to 33 pedestrian injuries in the record, bikes to 18, SUVs and cars to 126 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city rollup</a>).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-spits-you-out>Where the street spits you out</h3><p>Tillary Street leads the injury tally here with 54 injuries and three serious injuries. Flatbush Avenue Extension shows 53 injuries and two serious injuries. Navy Street and Court Street also carry pain (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hotspots</a>).</p><p>Danger peaks in the late afternoon. From 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., injuries stack up hour by hour, hitting an 86‑injury spike at 2 p.m. Two deaths in this span landed at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. The clock does not matter. The body count comes either way (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly pattern</a>).</p><p>Failure to yield shows up in the files. So does inattention. So does improper passing. Unsafe speed appears in the case file where a rider on an e‑bike hit a woman crossing with the signal at Flatbush and Nevins; she suffered severe cuts. The sheet says the rider was unlicensed. It also says “Unsafe Speed” and “Passing or Lane Usage Improper” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>case detail</a>).</p><h3 id=children-in-the-crosswalk>Children in the crosswalk</h3><p>On Atlantic at Court, a 4‑year‑old boy crossing with the signal was hit by a left‑turning 2013 vehicle. The log lists “Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way” and “Passenger Distraction.” He lived. He carries the entry “Crush Injuries” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>intersection case</a>).</p><p>At 501 Atlantic Avenue, a 67‑year‑old woman in the marked crosswalk was struck. The driver’s sheet reads “Driver Inattention/Distraction” and “Failure to Yield.” She suffered severe cuts. She was conscious. She also had the walk (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>intersection case</a>).</p><p>This is not a riddle. Cars turn. People cross. The paint does not stop steel.</p><h3 id=what-city-hall-has-on-paper>What City Hall has on paper</h3><p>At City Hall, Council Member Lincoln Restler put his name on a resolution to let cameras ticket owners for posted parking rules. The stated aim is fewer illegal blockers. It sits in committee. The text calls on Albany to pass A.5440. The Council file is dated Aug. 14, 2025 (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>council record</a>).</p><p>He also co‑sponsored a bill to force DOT to install school‑zone safety devices within 60 days after a study finding. Introduced the same day. Still in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill file</a>).</p><p>In Albany, lawmakers renewed New York City’s school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. One sponsor, Senator Andrew Gounardes, backed it. The city’s own numbers tied cameras to sharp drops in speeding and severe injuries, according to coverage on June 30, 2025 (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog</a>; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>).</p><p>Gounardes also sponsored and voted yes in committee to require speed limiters for repeat violators under S 4045 in June 2025. The summary says it targets drivers who rack up points or repeated camera tickets. It passed committee votes on June 11–12 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file</a>).</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-siren-on-tillary>What would stop the next siren on Tillary</h3><ul><li>Daylight the corners and harden the turns at Tillary, Jay, and the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Flatbush Avenue Extension</a>. These are the injury leaders.</li><li>Give walkers a head start at Atlantic and Court and across Flatbush. The case files list left turns, failed yields, and distraction.</li><li>Target the late‑day hours for enforcement at the known peaks. The city’s clock data points to the 2–6 p.m. window.</li></ul><p>Then tackle the citywide pattern that feeds these corners:</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed limit. Albany already renewed cameras citywide through 2030. The data tied them to fewer severe injuries where placed (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog</a>).</li><li><strong>Pass and enforce speed limiters for repeat offenders.</strong> S 4045 is written for that. It cleared Senate committees with a yes from its sponsor (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file</a>).</li></ul><p>The map of Downtown Brooklyn is a ledger. Tillary. Flatbush. Atlantic. Names we know. Bodies we do not.</p><p>Take one step that counts. Tell City Hall and Albany to act now.

The crash also left a 4-year-old boy in critical condition. Yarimi faces manslaughter, negligent homicide, assault, reckless driving, and more. Her license was suspended. Her car had 99 violations in a year, including 21 speeding and five red-light tickets. Advocates, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, blame Albany’s delay in passing Senator Andrew Gounardes’s bill to require speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders. Furnas said, “If Albany had passed this bill when it was first introduced, this vehicle would already have been speed limited and this crash would never have happened.” The bill remains pending.

"This means no new station elevators for elderly and disabled riders, and no new subway signals to speed up commutes for working New Yorkers."" -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration withdrew federal approval for New York City's congestion pricing program. U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy cited burdens on working-class drivers and questioned the legality of using toll revenue for transit. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit to challenge the move, arguing the program is settled law and already reduces congestion. State Senators Andrew Gounardes and Zellnor Myrie condemned the action, warning, 'Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system.' The withdrawal aligns with New Jersey's opposition and threatens transit upgrades like elevators for elderly and disabled riders. Local officials and advocates say ending congestion pricing will harm vulnerable road users and worsen street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
