He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year.

The matter, highlighted in the annual March (Parking) Madness contest, compared the 84th and 69th Precincts for their illegal parking practices. Restler said, "Placard permit holders and users of fake placards park illegally every day and it's simply the status quo." He noted, "These cars obstruct pedestrian space, endanger cyclists, and undermine safety on our streets." Restler supports legislation to reduce placard issuance and the creation of an independent enforcement unit outside the NYPD. Between January 2017 and February 2022, the 84th Precinct area saw 219 crashes injuring cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists. Police cars often took over sidewalks despite having two parking lots. The statement underscores how unchecked police parking endangers vulnerable road users and blocks safe passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Gale A. Brewer (primary), Justin L. Brannan, Erik D. Bottcher, Kalman Yeger, and Lincoln Restler sponsored the measure. The bill sought to codify an existing city rule (34 RCNY 4-12(j)), making it illegal to operate, stand, or park vehicles for commercial advertising. Violators would face a $500 penalty.

The push follows years of crashes—67 cyclist injuries and 196 total crashes since 2019—despite so-called 'protected' lanes. The matter, titled 'Activists and electeds ask DOT to add better barriers to Grand Street bike lane,' highlights how plastic bollards fail to stop drivers from blocking lanes, forcing cyclists into traffic. Restler, along with Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Julia Salazar, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, signed a letter urging Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriguez to act. The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected. Activists say, 'We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021.' The call is clear: real barriers, not broken promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They want special permits to drop parking. They say parking rules drive up costs, block affordable homes, and fuel car use. The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso linked better buses to less car dependence and climate action. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pledged 150 new miles of busways and lanes.

He tried to ride the Schermerhorn Street bike lane after a snowstorm. The lane was blocked by snow and illegally parked vehicles. Restler took 41 minutes to travel half a mile and was forced to leave the lane. He declared, 'No one should have to bike into traffic because of a row of illegally parked cars.' Restler called for a comprehensive street redesign and protected bike lanes, saying, 'There’s a crisis on Schermerhorn Street.' The Department of Transportation is reportedly working on a proposal. Restler’s action highlights the failure of painted lanes to protect cyclists. Most lanes in Downtown Brooklyn remain unprotected and easily blocked, putting riders at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users wait.</p><p class=mb3>On January 31, 2022, DOT confirmed that weigh-in-motion (WIM) sensors for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) will take a year to install. The pilot program, enabled by a state bill signed December 22, aims to fine illegally overweight trucks. The bill was introduced by State lawmakers Brian Kavanagh and Jo Anne Simon. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, pressed for rapid installation, warning, "There are extremely overweight trucks barreling down the triple cantilever every single day that are a hazard to the health and safety of our community." The matter title states: "Tonnage sensors on the BQE will take a year to set up: DOT." The project is complex, requiring city and state DOT coordination and a 90-day grace period once operational. Vulnerable road users remain exposed while the system is delayed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
