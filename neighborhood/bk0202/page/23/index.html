Some never made it to the other side.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-sayand-what-they-do>What Leaders Say—and What They Do</h2><p>After a mother and her two daughters were killed by a driver with a suspended license and a record of violations, State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said</a>, “It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act. The senselessness of this most recent crash is compounded by the fact that this car had dozens of speed and red light violations, and the driver had a suspended license.”</p><p>Assemblymember Emily Gallagher <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>put it plain</a>: “A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.”</p><p>The city has plans—<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/06/dot-proposes-protected-bike-lane-for-court-street-this-summer>protected bike lanes for Court Street</a>, narrower lanes to stop double parking. But the deaths keep coming. The bills stall. The cameras wait for reauthorization. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapses. The law lets the city lower speed limits, but the limit stays high.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, another family breaks. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

MTA officials, including John McCarthy, defended the environmental review, citing extensive outreach and public hearings. The bill’s status is an official response to legal challenge, not a council vote or committee action. No direct safety impact assessment for vulnerable road users was provided.

The redesign, shaped by months of public meetings, aimed to remove a vehicle lane in each direction to add protected bike lanes. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher backed the safety-focused plan. The mayor’s reversal followed pressure from local businesses and the 'Keep McGuinness Moving' campaign. Over 7,000 people signed a petition for the redesign, while about 4,000 opposed it. The official matter summary states: 'Mayor Eric Adams appears to have ordered the city's Department of Transportation (DOT) to reverse course on a planned redesign of McGuinness Boulevard after powerful locals and influential members of the administration voiced their opposition.' The delay means the street remains dangerous for people walking and biking. Supporters warn that every day without changes puts lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a 'NYC transportation policy dispute: McGuinness Blvd safety redesign reversal,' saw Adams cite opposition from a business-organized town hall, despite over 7,000 residents signing a petition for the redesign. Council Member Lincoln Restler, who supported the plan, criticized Adams, stating, 'We experience a crash per week on McGuinness.' Restler called for renewed efforts to implement the safety measures, highlighting the ongoing danger to pedestrians and cyclists. The mayor’s decision, influenced by his chief adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, leaves vulnerable road users at risk and delays long-promised protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mamdani, at a press conference, said, 'This is an initiative to make our streets safer for our children.' Gounardes added, 'We the public has had to bear the cost of people's decisions to drive these mini-tanks.' The bill earmarks new revenue for street safety projects, aiming to protect vulnerable road users from the growing threat of oversized vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No direct safety impact noted.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1115-2023 was introduced on June 22, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill sought to amend city code by setting penalties for alternate side parking violations at $65 for a first offense and $100 for each subsequent offense within a 12-month period. After three violations in a year, the vehicle would be towed if found in violation again. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing penalties for alternate side parking violations and requiring towing of certain vehicles in violation of alternate side parking rules.' Council Members Erik D. Bottcher (primary sponsor) and Lincoln Restler (co-sponsor) led the effort. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst assessment was provided, and no direct impact on vulnerable road users was noted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Restler and activists stood firm.</p><p class=mb3>On June 16, 2023, a contentious town hall convened over the city’s proposed safety redesign for McGuinness Boulevard. The meeting, billed as an 'awareness town hall,' was dominated by opponents, including Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte-Hermelyn and business leaders like Tony Argento of Broadway Stages. Bichotte-Hermelyn, whose district is far from the site, admitted limited knowledge of the plan but cited business concerns. The session excluded supporters of the redesign, who rallied outside. The Department of Transportation defended its proposal to reduce lanes and add parking-protected bike lanes, citing proven safety benefits. Council Member Lincoln Restler and activists later rallied for the overhaul, insisting that safety for all road users must not be compromised. The event highlighted deep divisions and the influence of business interests over street safety reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
