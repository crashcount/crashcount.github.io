Eighteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past twelve months, 572 crashes tore through Downtown Brooklyn-Dumbo-Boerum Hill. The wounded are not numbers. A four-year-old struck in the crosswalk. A 74-year-old ejected from his e-bike, dead on Tillary Street. A woman, right rear passenger, crushed in a stopped SUV on Flatbush Avenue. The city keeps moving. The bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—42 incidents left pedestrians injured or worse. Buses, trucks, bikes, and motorcycles all played their part. Most of the injured were just crossing with the light. Some never made it to the other side.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-sayand-what-they-do>What Leaders Say—and What They Do</h2><p>After a mother and her two daughters were killed by a driver with a suspended license and a record of violations, State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said</a>, “It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act. The senselessness of this most recent crash is compounded by the fact that this car had dozens of speed and red light violations, and the driver had a suspended license.”</p><p>Assemblymember Emily Gallagher <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>put it plain</a>: “A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.”</p><p>The city has plans—<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/06/dot-proposes-protected-bike-lane-for-court-street-this-summer>protected bike lanes for Court Street</a>, narrower lanes to stop double parking. But the deaths keep coming. The bills stall. The cameras wait for reauthorization. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapses. The law lets the city lower speed limits, but the limit stays high.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, another family breaks. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

Introduced September 26, 2024, it urges passage of S.5008A/A.803A. The measure calls for a 'bicycle lane safety program' using cameras to enforce bike lane rules. Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, and Erik D. Bottcher back the resolution. The text states: 'enforce certain restrictions on the use of bicycle lanes and protected bicycle lanes by means of bicycle lane photo devices.' The council demands Albany act. Cyclists die while drivers block lanes.

The incident, reported by brooklynpaper.com, saw a 74-year-old pedestrian killed while crossing Ridge Boulevard at Bay Ridge Avenue. The matter, titled 'Police seek driver of white SUV after 74-year-old killed in Bay Ridge hit-and-run,' details how the driver fled, leaving the victim and several damaged vehicles behind. Brannan posted: 'This is not the news any of us wanted to wake up to today. One of our neighbors was killed by a driver in a white SUV last night. The driver took off, and all of it was captured on video.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes also voiced outrage and concern. Both officials pledged to support the investigation and seek justice for the victim.

Segundo Reina-Gaon, 74, was killed crossing Ridge Blvd. near Bay Ridge Ave. The incident happened just a block from where State Senator Andrew Gounardes met with Department of Transportation officials to discuss safety issues earlier that week. Gounardes responded, 'Devastated to wake up to the news that a Bay Ridge neighbor was killed by an SUV in a hit-and-run last night. Just two days ago I was discussing safety concerns one block from here with DOT.' The NYPD set up a checkpoint at the crash site, stopping vehicles and checking IDs.
