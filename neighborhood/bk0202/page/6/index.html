Flatbush grinds. Atlantic does not forgive.</p><p>A 74‑year‑old man on an e‑bike died when a bus made a right at Tillary and Jay. The city record lists “E‑Bike” and “Bus.” It lists “Ejected.” It lists “Apparent Death.” The time was 8:15 p.m. on Nov. 6, 2024. The place was here. The turn was right. The man did not get up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash log</a>).</p><p>At Flatbush Avenue and State Street, a 45‑year‑old woman riding in the back seat was killed. The SUV was stopped in traffic. A sedan came straight. She died at 11:04 p.m. on Feb. 28, 2025. The sheet says “Crush Injuries.” It says “Apparent Death” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash log</a>).</p><p>The rest live, but hurt. Since 2022, this area logged 2,231 crashes, 1,005 injuries, and two deaths. Pedestrians: 183 hurt. Cyclists: 166 hurt. People in cars: 616 hurt. Heavy vehicles did their share: trucks and buses are tied to 33 pedestrian injuries in the record, bikes to 18, SUVs and cars to 126 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city rollup</a>).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-spits-you-out>Where the street spits you out</h3><p>Tillary Street leads the injury tally here with 54 injuries and three serious injuries. Flatbush Avenue Extension shows 53 injuries and two serious injuries. Navy Street and Court Street also carry pain (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hotspots</a>).</p><p>Danger peaks in the late afternoon. From 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., injuries stack up hour by hour, hitting an 86‑injury spike at 2 p.m. Two deaths in this span landed at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. The clock does not matter. The body count comes either way (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly pattern</a>).</p><p>Failure to yield shows up in the files. So does inattention. So does improper passing. Unsafe speed appears in the case file where a rider on an e‑bike hit a woman crossing with the signal at Flatbush and Nevins; she suffered severe cuts. The sheet says the rider was unlicensed. It also says “Unsafe Speed” and “Passing or Lane Usage Improper” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>case detail</a>).</p><h3 id=children-in-the-crosswalk>Children in the crosswalk</h3><p>On Atlantic at Court, a 4‑year‑old boy crossing with the signal was hit by a left‑turning 2013 vehicle. The log lists “Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way” and “Passenger Distraction.” He lived. He carries the entry “Crush Injuries” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>intersection case</a>).</p><p>At 501 Atlantic Avenue, a 67‑year‑old woman in the marked crosswalk was struck. The driver’s sheet reads “Driver Inattention/Distraction” and “Failure to Yield.” She suffered severe cuts. She was conscious. She also had the walk (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>intersection case</a>).</p><p>This is not a riddle. Cars turn. People cross. The paint does not stop steel.</p><h3 id=what-city-hall-has-on-paper>What City Hall has on paper</h3><p>At City Hall, Council Member Lincoln Restler put his name on a resolution to let cameras ticket owners for posted parking rules. The stated aim is fewer illegal blockers. It sits in committee. The text calls on Albany to pass A.5440. The Council file is dated Aug. 14, 2025 (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>council record</a>).</p><p>He also co‑sponsored a bill to force DOT to install school‑zone safety devices within 60 days after a study finding. Introduced the same day. Still in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill file</a>).</p><p>In Albany, lawmakers renewed New York City’s school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. One sponsor, Senator Andrew Gounardes, backed it. The city’s own numbers tied cameras to sharp drops in speeding and severe injuries, according to coverage on June 30, 2025 (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog</a>; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>).</p><p>Gounardes also sponsored and voted yes in committee to require speed limiters for repeat violators under S 4045 in June 2025. The summary says it targets drivers who rack up points or repeated camera tickets. It passed committee votes on June 11–12 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file</a>).</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-siren-on-tillary>What would stop the next siren on Tillary</h3><ul><li>Daylight the corners and harden the turns at Tillary, Jay, and the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Flatbush Avenue Extension</a>.

Cyclists keep dying.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee considered S533, a bill to repeal congestion pricing, after a procedural motion by Sen. Jack Martins. Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets. Cyclist deaths keep rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article reports, "Police arrested 44-year-old Laura Cordova... for driving without a license and using a vehicle without ignition interlock." The incident took place near Tillary Street just before 10 p.m. on May 10. The motorcyclist, 27-year-old Sean Johnson, struck Cordova's stopped Honda Accord and later died at Brooklyn Hospital Center. Cordova was required to use an ignition interlock device due to a prior conviction but was not charged with DUI. The NYPD Highway Collision Investigation Squad continues to investigate. The case highlights issues of unlicensed driving and compliance with court-ordered safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Data shows Black drivers face more searches and arrests. NYPD blamed crime patterns. Lawmakers called it an excuse. The city’s history of biased policing loomed large.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2025, the City Council held an oversight hearing on NYPD traffic enforcement and racial bias. Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
