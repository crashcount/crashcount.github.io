A child crosses with the light. A man rides home. In Downtown Brooklyn-Dumbo-Boerum Hill, the street does not forgive. In the last twelve months, two people died. Three more were left with injuries so grave they will not forget. In all, 253 neighbors were hurt. The numbers do not blink. They do not care who you are.</p><p>A four-year-old boy was struck at Atlantic and Court. He was crossing with the signal. The car turned left. The boy was hit in the leg. The cause: failure to yield, passenger distraction. The boy lived. He will carry the mark (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 74-year-old man on an e-bike was killed at Tillary and Jay. A bus turned right. The man was thrown.

The city does. After a mother and her two daughters were killed by a driver with a suspended license and a record of violations, leaders gathered on Borough Hall’s steps. State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>called for action</a>: &ldquo;It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act. The senselessness of this most recent crash is compounded by the fact that this car had dozens of speed and red light violations, and the driver had a suspended license.&rdquo;</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The &ldquo;Stop Super Speeders&rdquo; bill waits in Albany. Assemblymember Emily Gallagher <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>explained</a>, &ldquo;A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Road Ahead: No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. It can bring back the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. It can build streets that do not kill. But it will not act unless you force it.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. The dead do not get a second chance. The living do. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
