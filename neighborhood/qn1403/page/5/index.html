Council Members Robert F. Holden (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The summary reads: 'This bill would prohibit the operation of electric scooters and bicycles with electric assist in any park under the jurisdiction of the department of parks and recreation.' No safety analyst assessed the bill’s impact on vulnerable road users.

The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On September 7, 2023, QueensLink supporters rallied at City Hall, pushing for the reactivation of an old rail line between southeast and central Queens. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted the proposal's promise: 'both new train service and park land.' State Sen. James Sanders led the call, declaring, 'Yes, we want a park and yes we want a light rail. We can have both.' Mike Scala, another advocate, stressed public support for a combined approach. The QueensLink faces competition from the QueensWay, a park-only plan with $35 million in city funding. The MTA has not committed, citing high costs and ongoing needs assessment. No formal council bill or committee action is recorded yet. Supporters remain determined to see transit, park space, and bike paths included in future city plans.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to amend the city code by 'increasing civil penalties for operating a bicycle, bicycle with electric assist, or electric scooter on the sidewalk.' The measure would have raised fines up to $510 for endangering others, with double penalties for repeat violations and extra penalties for physical contact. Council Member Gale A. Brewer sponsored the bill, joined by Gennaro, Lee, Brannan, Yeger, Kagan, Vernikov, and Ariola. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst assessed its impact on vulnerable road users. The bill focused on sidewalk riding, but left the core danger—cars on city streets—untouched.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
