The proposal aims to increase housing near transit, allow mixed-use zoning, and eliminate parking mandates. Council Members Joann Ariola and Vicki Paladino led opposition, calling the plan an 'unmitigated disaster' and disputing housing data. Ariola argued, 'That's what they bought in the suburbs for.' Other Queens officials and residents echoed fears for single-family homeowners and suburban 'character.' In contrast, Borough President Donovan Richards's spokesperson and some residents supported the reforms, citing the city's affordability crisis. The majority of public testimony favored the proposal, but entrenched opposition from Queens officials remains strong. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push.

The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered," would force all e-bikes, e-scooters, and similar vehicles not already covered by DMV rules to register with the Department of Transportation and display a visible plate. Council Member Inna Vernikov led as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Farías, Riley, Brannan, and many others. The bill was laid over in committee on December 11, 2024. The measure aims to track these vehicles, but its impact on vulnerable road users remains unassessed. The city’s debate continues, with no law yet in force.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that the department of transportation maintain curb heights following street construction,' targets a simple failure: after street work, curbs often vanish, water pools, and property owners get fined for city mistakes. Council Member Joann Ariola sponsors, joined by Holden, Paladino, and Vernikov. The bill orders DOT to restore curbs to proper height after any street, sidewalk, or gutter work. The committee has not voted. The bill aims to stop flooding and fines, but leaves the daily hazard for walkers and wheelchair users unaddressed until passed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Private owners are off the hook.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0221-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on February 28, 2024. The bill states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the parks department to repair damage caused by trees owned by the city of New York.' Council Members James F. Gennaro (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and Inna Vernikov back the measure. Their bill requires the Parks Department to repair sidewalks damaged by city-owned trees, removing the burden from homeowners of one-, two-, or three-family homes. Owners must notify the city if tree roots break the walk. If the damage is not tree-related, owners still have ninety days to fix it. The bill aims to clarify responsibility and ensure city action on hazards caused by its own trees.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
