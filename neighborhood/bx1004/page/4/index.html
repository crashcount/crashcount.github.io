Teenagers, faces broken, after a police pursuit ended in a crash. <strong>No one is spared.</strong></p><h3 id=road-rage-gunfire-and-the-price-of-inaction>Road Rage, Gunfire, and the Price of Inaction</h3><p>On a June night, a minor crash. Words. Then gunfire. <strong>Keino Campbell, 27, a Navy veteran, shot dead in his car.</strong> His mother, Suzette Thomas, said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/u-s-navy-veteran-killed-road-rage-arrest-nyc/>&ldquo;I want people to remember my son as a humble person, one to do the best for the world.&rdquo;</a> His father <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-road-rage-arrest-made-navy-veteran-keino-campbell-shot-killed-dispute/16766460/>pleaded</a>, &ldquo;Stop jumping out of car and shooting people, guys. Use your insurance. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for.&rdquo;</p><p>This is not just a story of cars and speed. It is a story of lives ended for nothing. Of families left with empty chairs and words that cannot be unsaid.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. Of lower speed limits. Of cameras that catch the reckless. But in Co-Op City, the grind continues. <strong>No new laws or redesigns have come to these corners.</strong> The numbers do not lie: 477 crashes, 1 death, 242 injuries. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to harden crosswalks and protect the old and the young. <strong>It has not used it here.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The city will not save you unless you force its hand. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution calls for 'purchasers of limited use motorcycles present a driver’s license appropriate for the legal operation... and register such limited use motorcycles, prior to completing a purchase.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer leads, joined by Rivera, Schulman, Krishnan, Won, Bottcher, and others. The bills would require dealers to check licenses and register mopeds at sale. The Council notes that illegal, unregistered mopeds endanger pedestrians, cyclists, and riders. NYPD seized over 8,600 illegal mopeds by September 2023. The resolution presses for safeguards to keep unlicensed, unregistered vehicles off city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian was crossing a marked crosswalk without a signal when the vehicle, traveling in reverse, struck her at the center back end. The impact caused a contusion and bruising to her hip and upper leg. The driver, a licensed male from New York, was the sole occupant of the SUV. The report lists the pre-crash action as backing and the point of impact as the vehicle's center back end. No specific driver errors like failure to yield were noted, but backing without clear visibility was the critical factor.

It called on the State Legislature and Governor to create unlimited transfers within two hours for MTA pay-per-ride users. The resolution was introduced October 19, 2023, and filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation, which would create unlimited transfers within the two-hour period of paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority subway or bus fare for pay-per-ride users.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Jennifer Gutiérrez, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, and Kevin C. Riley. The bill targeted fare burdens on riders with long, complex trips, who now pay more than those with direct routes.
