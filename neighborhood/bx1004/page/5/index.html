Seven were left with serious injuries. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars the city cannot count.</p><p>Pedestrians are struck by trucks, taxis, SUVs. A 76-year-old woman was killed by a dump truck at an intersection. A 59-year-old woman was left bleeding in the road after a taxi hit her.

Of lower speed limits. Of cameras that catch the reckless. But in Co-Op City, the grind continues. <strong>No new laws or redesigns have come to these corners.</strong> The numbers do not lie: 477 crashes, 1 death, 242 injuries. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to harden crosswalks and protect the old and the young. <strong>It has not used it here.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member.

Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.
