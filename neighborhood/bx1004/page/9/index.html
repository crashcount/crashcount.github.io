The deadliest machines are cars and trucks. Pedestrians have been struck most often by sedans, SUVs, and trucks. No bikes or mopeds killed anyone here, but the threat from cars never lets up.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member Kevin Riley has co-sponsored bills for speed humps, curb extensions, and safer crosswalks. He voted to legalize jaywalking and expand crash investigations. But the pace is slow. <strong>No law has yet forced a citywide 20 mph speed limit.</strong></p><p>State Senator Jamaal Bailey voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting tech. Assembly Member Michael Benedetto voted to extend school speed zones. These are steps, not leaps. The street where Stella Nyarko-Dei died is still a speedway.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>One crash. One death. It is enough.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras everywhere. Demand action, not delay. The next crash is waiting at the light.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
