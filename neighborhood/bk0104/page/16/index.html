Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In just the past twelve months, 314 more were hurt. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars the city cannot count.</p><p>The last year saw a man in his twenties kneel to pick up food on Withers Street. A dump truck turned. He did not get up. The driver left the scene. No arrests. No answers. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is still investigating. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Police said the driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene. No arrests have been announced.</a></p><p><strong>Trucks and SUVs crush. Cyclists are thrown. Pedestrians vanish.</strong> The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city says it is working. They talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets. But the trucks keep turning. The bodies keep falling. <strong>&ldquo;Unfortunately, somebody has to die before something gets done,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/28/city-to-fix-dangerous-bushwick-intersection-where-driver-killed-motorcyclist>said Joann Perahia after another fatal crash in Bushwick.</a></p><p>There are new laws. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders, but only if Albany lets them. The city redesigns intersections, but only after the blood dries. Local leaders talk. The street does not listen.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can lower speed limits now. The council can demand more cameras, more daylight, fewer blind corners. But they move only when pushed.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action before the next name is carved in stone.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report calls to 'ensure safe, clean, well-maintained sidewalks with well-lit intersections,' and to 'provide training to MTA bus drivers on working with older riders and riders with disabilities.' Hudson stated, 'We have to do all we can to ensure that our communities are responsive to the needs of our aging population.'

The Department of Transportation delayed environmental review to study both options. Advocates and officials urge investment in mass transit, not highway expansion.

Intro 501 would fine drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants, with civilians able to report violations and receive a portion of the fine. Reynoso said, 'Those are two pieces I’d love to see pushed absolutely.' He also champions protected bike lanes, a comprehensive bike network, and the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway. Reynoso’s stance is clear: streets must be safer for people walking and biking. He wants action after recent traffic violence and supports more open streets.

The bill required the Department of Transportation to study and report on using street design to limit or reduce commercial vehicle use in residential neighborhoods. The matter’s title reads: 'A Local Law in relation to requiring the department of transportation to study street design as a means to limit or reduce the use by commercial vehicles of streets in residential neighborhoods.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsored the bill, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate, and others. The report was due by December 31, 2023. The bill was filed at the end of session with no report issued. The measure aimed to examine street redesign, traffic calming, and camera enforcement to keep trucks out of residential areas, but it stalled before any impact reached the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution urged, in its own words, 'top maritime importers to New York City ports to commit to making the City’s streets greener by reducing truck traffic and using marine vessels for last mile deliveries throughout the boroughs.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsored, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate Williams, and others. The bill cited the city’s reliance on trucks—89% of freight—fueling congestion, pollution, and risk for everyone outside a vehicle. The Council pointed to pilot programs like Blue Highways as a way to clear streets and cut emissions. But the resolution was filed without action. Trucks still rule the road.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
