Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In just the past twelve months, 314 more were hurt. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars the city cannot count.</p><p>The last year saw a man in his twenties kneel to pick up food on Withers Street. A dump truck turned. He did not get up. The driver left the scene. No arrests. No answers. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is still investigating. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Police said the driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene. No arrests have been announced.</a></p><p><strong>Trucks and SUVs crush. Cyclists are thrown. Pedestrians vanish.</strong> The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city says it is working. They talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets. But the trucks keep turning.

Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders, but only if Albany lets them. The city redesigns intersections, but only after the blood dries. Local leaders talk. The street does not listen.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can lower speed limits now. The council can demand more cameras, more daylight, fewer blind corners. But they move only when pushed.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action before the next name is carved in stone.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation's new plan, described as a 'compromised version,' adds protected bike lanes but keeps two car lanes during peak hours from Calyer Street to the Pulaski Bridge. The matter, titled 'Relief in Greenpoint as compromise reached on McGuinness Boulevard redesign,' reflects years of advocacy for safer streets. Restler, along with Borough President Reynoso and others, welcomed the changes and pledged to push for swift implementation. Advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe criticized the compromise as 'less effective and less safe,' blaming business opposition for watering down the original plan. The compromise marks a partial win for vulnerable road users, but falls short of the full road diet advocates demanded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Protected bike lanes will come, but car lanes stay open during peak hours. The plan falls short of full safety measures. The road remains dangerous. Victims still count. No one is satisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, Mayor Adams announced a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious Brooklyn corridor. The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The call is clear: fix McGuinness now.</p><p class=mb3>On August 11, 2023, Council Member Lincoln Restler and other Northern Brooklyn officials responded to a crash on McGuinness Boulevard, where a driver hit and injured a moped rider. The incident happened near Meeker Avenue, one block from where teacher Matthew Jensen was killed in 2021. The matter, titled 'Locals call for mayor to take immediate action after moped rider injured on McGuinness Boulevard,' highlights the urgent need for the Department of Transportation’s proposed safety redesign. Restler, along with U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, and State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, issued a joint statement: 'Lives are being put at risk. We need immediate action by the Mayor's office to implement the Department of Transportation's proposed safety improvements so that everyone in our community can feel confident that McGuinness Boulevard will not cause more tragedies.' The safety plan remains blocked, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, by Edison Properties, would add 95 parking spaces. Dan Garodnick, chair of the City Planning Commission, called the site 'ideal for housing.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, who represents the area, stated he is an unequivocal 'no' on the expansion and wants a use that benefits the community. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso urged the city to discourage private vehicles, citing high pedestrian traffic and strong transit access. City Planning Commissioner Juan Camilo Osorio highlighted policies to cut car use and decarbonize the city. Officials warn that more parking means more cars and more danger for people walking and biking, especially after a major bike lane was added to Schermerhorn Street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
