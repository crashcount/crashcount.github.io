Three deaths.</strong> The bodies keep coming. Just last week, a box truck killed a man crossing Morgan Avenue near Sharon Street. No marked crosswalk. No safe passage. The street is a gauntlet for anyone on foot or bike. Juan Ignacio Serra stood where his friend Daniel Vidal died three years ago and said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>&ldquo;I was sad and angry at the same time because I still feel that these are things that can be prevented. I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>Trucks and heavy vehicles rule these streets.</strong> In the last twelve months, East Williamsburg saw 878 crashes, 3 deaths, and 414 injuries. Seven people were seriously hurt. Trucks killed four pedestrians in recent years. Cyclists and walkers are left to fend for themselves.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-action>Leadership: Words, Not Action</h3><p>Local leaders have written letters. They have held meetings. They have called for protected bike lanes, mid-block crossings, and safer loading zones. State Senator Julia Salazar, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher all back the push. But the city has not acted. The danger remains. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>&ldquo;In areas that were formally industrial—a lot of trucks, lot of heavy construction activity—that are becoming residential where cycling is more popular, we’re unfortunately seeing a lot of collisions with cyclists and trucks,&rdquo;</a> said former DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg.</p><p>Senator Salazar has voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. Assembly Member Davila has co-sponsored speed limiter bills. But the street stays the same. The city delays. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=the-slow-disaster>The Slow Disaster</h3><p><strong>East Williamsburg is bleeding.</strong> Nine killed since 2022. Over 1,350 injured. Trucks, SUVs, and cars do most of the harm. The city knows the danger. The leaders know the danger. Still, the street stays deadly.</p><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more than words.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them: No more deaths on Morgan Avenue. No more waiting. No more excuses. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Push for protected bike lanes, safe crossings, and real change—now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Seabrook allegedly crashed a Kia Sportage into a Toyota Yaris carrying Wallace and friends, then fled the scene on foot. Wallace died; two others were critically injured. The Toyota’s driver was also charged with driving without a license. Seabrook faces charges including manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and leaving the scene. The article quotes Wallace’s aunt: “He lived life to the fullest.

As the truck pulled out, a motorcycle traveling straight ahead collided with its side. The motorcyclist, age 47, was thrown from his vehicle and suffered severe lacerations to his leg, described as 'knee-lower leg foot' injuries, and was partially ejected but remained conscious. The report notes the truck sustained no damage, while the motorcycle's left front bumper took the impact. Both vehicles list 'Other Vehicular' as contributing factors, which, in this context, points to the truck's movement from parking as a critical action preceding the crash. The police narrative underscores the violence of the impact and the aftermath, with blood spreading on the blacktop. No driver errors beyond 'Other Vehicular' are specified, and no victim behavior is cited as a contributing factor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The official matter focused on 'excessive illegal parking—including by the local police precinct.' CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers. The City Council is expected to reject the project, blocking new homes and locking in car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) would not commit to a 'road diet' or redesign for the deadly 13-block Brooklyn stretch, pending a traffic study that could take two years and requires Council funding. Council Members Crystal Hudson and Chi Ossé, along with Borough President Antonio Reynoso, demanded a fully funded redesign, calling Atlantic Avenue 'one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough.' Residents testified about fear and danger from speeding cars and blind turns. From 2021 to 2024, four people died and 473 were injured in 831 crashes. Advocates and lawmakers condemned DOT's reluctance, calling it emblematic of citywide failures.

She wants strong tenant protections, affordable housing, and safer streets. The plan cuts lanes, adds metered parking, and targets deadly intersections. Community boards demand more. Residents fear displacement. The fight for safety and equity continues.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2025, Council Member Crystal Hudson (District 35) expressed support for the Atlantic Avenue Mixed-Use Plan, a rezoning proposal for central Brooklyn. The plan, conditionally endorsed by Community Boards 3 and 8, aims to create 4,600 apartments, protect manufacturing jobs, and improve street safety. The matter summary states the plan 'aims to bring nearly 4,600 new apartments, safeguard manufacturing space, and enhance pedestrian safety and infrastructure.' Hudson praised Borough President Reynoso’s recommendations, emphasizing 'strong manufacturing requirements, affordable housing, tenant protections, street safety, and workforce opportunities.' She called for a 'robust redesign of Atlantic Avenue that incorporates street safety improvements.' The plan includes a 'road diet' to reduce lanes, more metered parking, and safety upgrades at dangerous intersections. Residents and advocates raised concerns about displacement, legal protections, and infrastructure strain. The plan’s fate now rests with the city council and administration.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He calls for a road diet, better bike and pedestrian infrastructure, and metered parking. DOT offers piecemeal fixes, but no bold redesign. Advocates want more.</p><p class=mb3>On January 29, 2025, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso pressed the Department of Transportation to overhaul a six-lane stretch of Atlantic Avenue as part of a rezoning plan. Reynoso’s recommendations—outlined in his official statement—include a road diet, pedestrian and cyclist upgrades, and paid parking. He criticized DOT’s lack of detail, saying, 'Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum.' The Atlantic Avenue Mixed Use Plan, now heading to a Department of City Planning hearing, would rezone 13 blocks and remove parking minimums for new housing. Council Member Crystal Hudson acknowledged the community’s demand for safety but stopped short of backing a road diet. DOT has promised some safety tweaks—painted neckdowns, daylighting, planters, a new bike lane—but not a full redesign. Advocates and Transportation Alternatives call for protected bike lanes and pedestrian plazas. Reynoso’s push highlights the gap between incremental fixes and the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article notes that Gil was the second elderly pedestrian killed in Brooklyn this year, and cites Transportation Alternatives: '46 senior pedestrians were killed in car crashes across the city last year.'
