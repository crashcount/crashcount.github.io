Three deaths.</strong> The bodies keep coming. Just last week, a box truck killed a man crossing Morgan Avenue near Sharon Street. No marked crosswalk. No safe passage. The street is a gauntlet for anyone on foot or bike. Juan Ignacio Serra stood where his friend Daniel Vidal died three years ago and said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>&ldquo;I was sad and angry at the same time because I still feel that these are things that can be prevented. I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>Trucks and heavy vehicles rule these streets.</strong> In the last twelve months, East Williamsburg saw 878 crashes, 3 deaths, and 414 injuries. Seven people were seriously hurt. Trucks killed four pedestrians in recent years. Cyclists and walkers are left to fend for themselves.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-action>Leadership: Words, Not Action</h3><p>Local leaders have written letters. They have held meetings. They have called for protected bike lanes, mid-block crossings, and safer loading zones. State Senator Julia Salazar, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher all back the push. But the city has not acted. The danger remains. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>&ldquo;In areas that were formally industrial—a lot of trucks, lot of heavy construction activity—that are becoming residential where cycling is more popular, we’re unfortunately seeing a lot of collisions with cyclists and trucks,&rdquo;</a> said former DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg.</p><p>Senator Salazar has voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. Assembly Member Davila has co-sponsored speed limiter bills. But the street stays the same. The city delays. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=the-slow-disaster>The Slow Disaster</h3><p><strong>East Williamsburg is bleeding.</strong> Nine killed since 2022. Over 1,350 injured. Trucks, SUVs, and cars do most of the harm. The city knows the danger. The leaders know the danger. Still, the street stays deadly.</p><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more than words.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them: No more deaths on Morgan Avenue. No more waiting. No more excuses. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Push for protected bike lanes, safe crossings, and real change—now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A dump truck’s left turn ended his life as he crossed with the signal. The street held him, still and broken, beneath the right bumper’s crush.</p><p class=mb3>At the corner of Woodpoint Road and Withers Street in Brooklyn, a dump truck making a left turn struck and killed a baby boy who was crossing the intersection with the signal. According to the police report, 'a dump truck turned left. Its right bumper struck a baby boy crossing with the signal. He died there, crushed beneath steel and weight.' The report states the point of impact was the right front bumper of the truck. The child, a pedestrian, suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. The police narrative explicitly notes the victim was 'crossing with the signal.' The driver’s actions—executing a left turn in a large vehicle—placed the most vulnerable road user in mortal danger. The report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the victim, but the sequence of events centers the dump truck’s left turn and the resulting impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

He struck pedestrian Katherine Harris, 31, killing her instantly, then rear-ended another car and crashed into an outdoor dining shed. Trujillo's blood alcohol level was .17, more than twice the legal limit.

More parking means more cars, more danger for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>On February 18, 2025, Brooklyn Community Board 15 rejected a rezoning proposal at 2510 Coney Island Ave. The board’s vote came after the developer slashed housing units and promised a one-to-one parking ratio. The official matter focused on 'excessive illegal parking—including by the local police precinct.' CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers. The City Council is expected to reject the project, blocking new homes and locking in car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On February 6, 2025, the City Council held a hearing on the safety of Atlantic Avenue. The Department of Transportation (DOT) would not commit to a 'road diet' or redesign for the deadly 13-block Brooklyn stretch, pending a traffic study that could take two years and requires Council funding. Council Members Crystal Hudson and Chi Ossé, along with Borough President Antonio Reynoso, demanded a fully funded redesign, calling Atlantic Avenue 'one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough.' Residents testified about fear and danger from speeding cars and blind turns. From 2021 to 2024, four people died and 473 were injured in 831 crashes. Advocates and lawmakers condemned DOT's reluctance, calling it emblematic of citywide failures. The rezoning plan, which could add thousands of residents, now moves to the full Council.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, conditionally endorsed by Community Boards 3 and 8, aims to create 4,600 apartments, protect manufacturing jobs, and improve street safety. The matter summary states the plan 'aims to bring nearly 4,600 new apartments, safeguard manufacturing space, and enhance pedestrian safety and infrastructure.' Hudson praised Borough President Reynoso’s recommendations, emphasizing 'strong manufacturing requirements, affordable housing, tenant protections, street safety, and workforce opportunities.' She called for a 'robust redesign of Atlantic Avenue that incorporates street safety improvements.' The plan includes a 'road diet' to reduce lanes, more metered parking, and safety upgrades at dangerous intersections. Residents and advocates raised concerns about displacement, legal protections, and infrastructure strain. The plan’s fate now rests with the city council and administration.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
