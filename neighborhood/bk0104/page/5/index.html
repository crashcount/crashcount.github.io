The street is a gauntlet for anyone on foot or bike. Juan Ignacio Serra stood where his friend Daniel Vidal died three years ago and said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>&ldquo;I was sad and angry at the same time because I still feel that these are things that can be prevented. I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>Trucks and heavy vehicles rule these streets.</strong> In the last twelve months, East Williamsburg saw 878 crashes, 3 deaths, and 414 injuries. Seven people were seriously hurt. Trucks killed four pedestrians in recent years. Cyclists and walkers are left to fend for themselves.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-action>Leadership: Words, Not Action</h3><p>Local leaders have written letters. They have held meetings. They have called for protected bike lanes, mid-block crossings, and safer loading zones. State Senator Julia Salazar, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher all back the push. But the city has not acted. The danger remains. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>&ldquo;In areas that were formally industrial—a lot of trucks, lot of heavy construction activity—that are becoming residential where cycling is more popular, we’re unfortunately seeing a lot of collisions with cyclists and trucks,&rdquo;</a> said former DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg.</p><p>Senator Salazar has voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. Assembly Member Davila has co-sponsored speed limiter bills. But the street stays the same. The city delays. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=the-slow-disaster>The Slow Disaster</h3><p><strong>East Williamsburg is bleeding.</strong> Nine killed since 2022. Over 1,350 injured. Trucks, SUVs, and cars do most of the harm. The city knows the danger. The leaders know the danger. Still, the street stays deadly.</p><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more than words.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them: No more deaths on Morgan Avenue. No more waiting. No more excuses. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Push for protected bike lanes, safe crossings, and real change—now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He claims police issue red-light summonses to cyclists who cross intersections with the white pedestrian walk signal, despite a 2019 law permitting this. The article quotes Transportation Alternatives: “That 5-7 second head start can mean the difference between being hit by a turning car and being seen by a turning car.” Esparza says officers ignore the rule, issuing criminal summonses instead of traffic tickets.

The old highway’s days are numbered.

The project follows urgent requests in 2023 from Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch. The public process begins in June and may run into 2026. The redesign aims to end decades of danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
