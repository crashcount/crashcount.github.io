Three deaths.</strong> The bodies keep coming. Just last week, a box truck killed a man crossing Morgan Avenue near Sharon Street. No marked crosswalk. No safe passage. The street is a gauntlet for anyone on foot or bike. Juan Ignacio Serra stood where his friend Daniel Vidal died three years ago and said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>&ldquo;I was sad and angry at the same time because I still feel that these are things that can be prevented. I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>Trucks and heavy vehicles rule these streets.</strong> In the last twelve months, East Williamsburg saw 878 crashes, 3 deaths, and 414 injuries. Seven people were seriously hurt. Trucks killed four pedestrians in recent years. Cyclists and walkers are left to fend for themselves.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-action>Leadership: Words, Not Action</h3><p>Local leaders have written letters. They have held meetings. They have called for protected bike lanes, mid-block crossings, and safer loading zones. State Senator Julia Salazar, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher all back the push. But the city has not acted.

Nydia Velázquez, and Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez urged state officials to join the city in seeking federal funding for the BQGreen park proposal. The plan would cap a stretch of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in south Williamsburg, creating 3.5 acres of new parkland. Reynoso called on Governor Kathy Hochul to act as a co-applicant for funds, stating, "We're calling on Gov. Kathy Hochul to be a co-applicant alongside the City of New York for federal funding to finally deck the BQE." Velázquez said, "We are fighting to reimagine the way to reconnect neighborhoods, improve traffic and reduce toxic pollution." Gutierrez stressed the urgent need for open space and clean air. The proposal, estimated at $100-200 million, is framed as an environmental justice effort to heal a community long divided and harmed by the highway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, managed by the Department of Transportation, will run on five Saturdays in July and August, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., covering 17 miles. Borough presidents Antonio Reynoso (Brooklyn) and Donovan Richards (Queens) pushed for this expansion, with Reynoso praising the use of major corridors like Eastern Parkway. Mayor Adams said, “This is a five-borough city and we are now saying the Summer Streets program is going be a five-borough initiative. Everyone deserves to enjoy that.” Adams expressed interest in longer hours but cited public safety and NYPD staffing costs as barriers. Advocates want more hours and connected car-free routes. The city will spend $1.5 million, not including staffing. The expansion marks a step forward, but the early end time leaves advocates wanting more.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
