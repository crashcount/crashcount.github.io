The injured carry scars the city cannot count.</p><p>The last year saw a man in his twenties kneel to pick up food on Withers Street. A dump truck turned. He did not get up.

The city can lower speed limits now. The council can demand more cameras, more daylight, fewer blind corners. But they move only when pushed.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings.
