If DOT cannot meet the deadline, it must post a public notice and alert the community board. Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The measure responds to the hazard of prolonged, uneven streets, which put pedestrians, cyclists, and people with mobility devices at risk. The law’s timeline and notice rules take effect in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report lists aggressive driving and road rage as the sole contributing factors. The sedan struck the left rear quarter panel of one SUV and the left front of another. Two 20-year-old female occupants in one SUV—the driver and front passenger—were injured, suffering whiplash and injuries to their entire bodies. Both were conscious and restrained by lap belts and harnesses. No victim actions contributed to the crash.

The city’s parking chaos left concrete cracked and nerves frayed.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on January 17, 2025, that a BxM1 MTA bus partially drove off the Henry Hudson Parkway overpass near Kappock Street after the driver swerved to avoid a double-parked car. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz stated, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz highlighted the broader issue: "We’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced." The incident underscores the risks posed by illegal parking and the need for stricter enforcement and infrastructure checks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the rider was not wearing a helmet and was traveling straight ahead when the crash occurred. The narrative describes, 'Blood ran from his face. He stayed awake. The pavement did not move.' Police classified the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' No other vehicles or persons were involved, and there is no indication of driver error by another party. The report notes the rider's lack of helmet use, but lists this detail only after describing the incident and does not attribute it as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the physical consequences and the environment, with no blame assigned to the injured rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
