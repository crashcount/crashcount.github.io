Five left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In the last three years, the streets of Soundview-Clason Point have not been quiet. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>697 crashes, 334 injuries, 3 deaths</strong>—all in a place where children walk to school and elders cross to the bodega. No one is spared. In the last year alone, 89 people were hurt, 3 of them seriously. The youngest, under 18, took 13 of those blows. The oldest, over 75, were not safe either.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A car slams into parked cars on Seward Avenue. Metal screams. People are thrown. Robert Perez is pushed six feet by the force. He says, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/driver-stolen-vehicle-slams-parked-cars-bronx-fleeing-police/16181891/>&ldquo;It pushed me six feet. I hit my leg and my back. So, I don&rsquo;t even know what to do. I panicked. And the lady behind me, I think she fainted.&rdquo;</a> The driver runs. The pain stays. The shock lingers. The street is never the same.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> Cars and SUVs are the main weapons. In the last three years, they killed two and seriously injured one. Trucks and buses added another serious injury. Bikes and mopeds are not spared, but they do not kill here. The street is a gauntlet for the unprotected.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passes laws. But in Soundview-Clason Point, the blood dries slow. <strong>No local leader has stood up in public to demand more.</strong> No new protections. No bold redesigns. The silence is heavy. The danger is not.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings. Demand cameras that never sleep. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Aging trains, tracks, and tunnels wait for repairs. Riders and advocates demand action. Uncertainty grows as leaders debate how to fund essential transit upgrades. Vulnerable users remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the MTA capital plan funding debate as of July 30, 2024. The MTA’s 2025-29 capital program, discussed at the Capital Program Committee meeting, remains unfunded after Governor Hochul’s indefinite delay of congestion pricing. The matter centers on the need for new rail cars, power stations, and repairs to tracks and tunnels. MTA President of Construction and Development Jamie Torres-Springer stressed, 'We need to achieve 100 percent state-of-good-repair.' State Senator Jeremy Cooney challenged the governor to restore funding or implement congestion pricing within 100 days. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein urged, 'Gov. Hochul must start congestion pricing now to rebuild trust.' The MTA is $15 billion short on its 2020-24 plan, with no clear path forward. Transit advocates warn that underfunding public transit puts riders—especially those on foot or bike—at continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Additionally, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' was noted for the bicyclist, but the primary driver error was the failure to yield. The bicyclist was not wearing any safety equipment. Vehicle damage was minimal, indicating the severity of injury came from the impact and ejection rather than vehicle deformation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the rider was 'unlicensed, no helmet, ran the light on a moped.' The collision resulted in the teenager being ejected from the moped, suffering severe facial lacerations, and remaining conscious at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors. The driver was unlicensed and wore no safety equipment, as documented in the report. These failures—disregarding a traffic signal and operating at unsafe speed—are central to the crash. The report does not list any victim behaviors as contributing factors beyond those already attributed to the driver’s actions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
