Councilmember Amanda Farías called double-parking chronic and dangerous. The city seeks data to target problem spots. No cash reward, just a shot at safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>On May 3, 2023, the NYC Department of Transportation launched a public reporting portal for double-parking and blocked lanes. The initiative, not tied to a specific bill number, follows a 2021 law requiring DOT to consider public feedback when creating new loading zones. The portal lets users pinpoint and describe street obstructions. Councilmember Amanda Farías of District 18, who is mentioned in connection with the launch, stated, 'Double-parking is a chronic issue throughout our city, and is one of the largest quality of life issues facing my district everyday.' She added, 'It is not only illegal to double-park your car, but it puts others in danger when neighbors are unable to cross traffic safely, congestion is added to our streets, crossways and bike lanes are blocked, and emergency vehicles cannot respond in time.' The portal aims to collect data on dangerous spots, focusing city attention on hazards that threaten pedestrians, cyclists, and emergency response.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
