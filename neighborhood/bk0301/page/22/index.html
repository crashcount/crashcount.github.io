Twenty suffered injuries so grave they will never walk the same. Most were on foot. Some were riding bikes. Some were just crossing the street.</p><p><strong>Just last October, a 49-year-old man was killed at Bedford and Lafayette.</strong> He died at the intersection, struck by a driver who kept going straight. No name in the record. Only a body, a street, a time. Weeks later, a 37-year-old man was crushed and killed while working in the road on Myrtle Avenue. The machine that killed him was a truck. The record says “crush injuries.”</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> Since 2022, cars and SUVs have killed three people and hurt 220 more. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 23. Bikes and mopeds hurt a handful, but none killed. The numbers do not lie. The bigger the machine, the deeper the wound.</p><h2 id=promises-delays-and-silence>Promises, Delays, and Silence</h2><p><strong>The city promised protection. Then it took it away.</strong> Just days ago, crews began tearing out the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, leaving cyclists exposed again. The city will replace it with paint. No steel, no barrier. The <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/07/31/city-begins-removing-stretch-of-bedford-avenue-s-protected-bike-lane>city has begun removing a stretch of Bedford Avenue&rsquo;s protected bike lane, with plans to replace it with an unprotected one.</a> The work started at night. The danger will last all day.</p><p>Council Member Chi Ossé once called the delays &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and demanded a real timeline for safety. The <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/02/council-member-chi-osse-blasts-dot-for-delaying-and-maybe-killing-bedford-ave-bike-lane>Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.</a> The promise is broken. The street is still dangerous.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street remembers.
