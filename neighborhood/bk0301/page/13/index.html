A woman, 79, was crushed at Herkimer and New York. A 63-year-old man, crossing with the signal, was killed by a turning truck at Flushing and Bedford. In three and a half years, six people lost their lives to traffic violence in Bedford-Stuyvesant (West). Seventeen suffered serious injuries. Over 1,200 were hurt. Each number is a wound that does not heal.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and trucks do most of the damage. In the last 12 months, SUVs killed three. Trucks killed one. Bikes and mopeds injured, but did not kill. The street is a gauntlet. The biggest machines win. The smallest bodies lose.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The horror does not pause. In December, two cars were pinned between a box truck and an MTA bus at Nostrand and Park. A 9-year-old girl was among the injured. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/17/two-cars-pinned-by-box-truck-mta-bus-after-chaotic-crash-in-brooklyn/>Daily News wrote</a>: “Three people were injured, including an MTA bus driver and a young girl, in a collision that pinned two cars between a box truck and a city bus.”</p><p>Last month, an NYPD cruiser collided with a Nissan at Willoughby and Walworth. The officer was left in critical condition. The <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-officer-critically-injured-crash-responding-911-call-bedford-stuyvesant-brooklyn/16353099/>ABC7 report</a> was blunt: “A marked NYPD vehicle was traveling eastbound on Willoughby Avenue when it collided with a white Nissan Rogue traveling northbound on Walworth Street.”</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p>The city has tools: speed cameras, lower speed limits, intersection redesigns. But the pace is slow. The city can now set 20 mph limits under Sammy’s Law. It has not done so here. Cameras work, but need Albany’s blessing to stay on. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next? Demand Action</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to keep the cameras running. Tell them to fix the streets before another child is pinned between steel and glass. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
