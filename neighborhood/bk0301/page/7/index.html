Twenty suffered injuries so grave they will never walk the same. Most were on foot. Some were riding bikes. Some were just crossing the street.</p><p><strong>Just last October, a 49-year-old man was killed at Bedford and Lafayette.</strong> He died at the intersection, struck by a driver who kept going straight. No name in the record. Only a body, a street, a time. Weeks later, a 37-year-old man was crushed and killed while working in the road on Myrtle Avenue. The machine that killed him was a truck. The record says “crush injuries.”</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> Since 2022, cars and SUVs have killed three people and hurt 220 more. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 23. Bikes and mopeds hurt a handful, but none killed. The numbers do not lie. The bigger the machine, the deeper the wound.</p><h2 id=promises-delays-and-silence>Promises, Delays, and Silence</h2><p><strong>The city promised protection. Then it took it away.</strong> Just days ago, crews began tearing out the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, leaving cyclists exposed again. The city will replace it with paint. No steel, no barrier. The <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/07/31/city-begins-removing-stretch-of-bedford-avenue-s-protected-bike-lane>city has begun removing a stretch of Bedford Avenue&rsquo;s protected bike lane, with plans to replace it with an unprotected one.</a> The work started at night. The danger will last all day.</p><p>Council Member Chi Ossé once called the delays &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and demanded a real timeline for safety. The <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/02/council-member-chi-osse-blasts-dot-for-delaying-and-maybe-killing-bedford-ave-bike-lane>Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.</a> The promise is broken. The street is still dangerous.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street remembers.

DOT delays a promised bike lane. Elected officials and residents demand action. Private interests block progress. Cyclists face crashes and fear. The city shrugs. The gap remains. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2025, a coalition of Brooklyn officials—including Council Members Crystal Hudson, Shahana Hanif, Lincoln Restler, Assembly Members Andrew Gounardes, Jo Anne Simon, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso—sent a letter urging DOT to finish the protected bike lane on Ashland Place. The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.
