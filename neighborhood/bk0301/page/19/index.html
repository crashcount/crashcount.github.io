But after a child darted from a double-parked car and collided with an e-bike, the city caved. Mayor Adams said he was &ldquo;listening to community concerns&rdquo; and ordered the lane ripped out. &ldquo;We decided to adjust the current design to better reflect community feedback,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/adams-orders-removal-of-bike-lane-protection-along-stretch-of-brooklyns-bedford-avenue>said Adams</a>.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler called it what it is: &ldquo;This is just pure politics. That is not how safety decisions on our streets should be made&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-removal/>Restler told CBS</a>. The city will paint a line where there was once a barrier. The cars will keep parking. The children will keep running. The blood will keep flowing.</p><h3 id=who-gets-protected>Who Gets Protected?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and trucks did most of the killing.</strong> The city blames the victims, not the drivers or the street. The protected lane is gone. The illegal parking stays. The mayor calls it safety. The council calls it politics. The dead stay dead.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more-than-paint>What Next? Demand More Than Paint</h3><p><strong>Contact your council member. Demand real protection.</strong> Tell the mayor: paint is not a barrier. Tell the DOT: children need more than prayers. Tell your neighbors: silence is complicity. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to "prohibit the issuance of private vehicle parking permits and revoke such existing permits," with exceptions for people with disabilities and collective bargaining agreements. Council Member Christopher Marte led as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Brewer, Joseph, Nurse, Cabán, Avilés, Bottcher, Won, Ossé, and Richardson Jordan, plus the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aimed to end a system that let private cars claim curb space, fueling illegal parking and danger for those on foot or bike. It was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. The status quo remains: permits still shield drivers, while vulnerable road users face the risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
