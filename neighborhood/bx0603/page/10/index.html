They only count the bodies and the broken bones.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In the last twelve months, 149 people were hurt in 254 crashes.

Bullets flew. A car slammed into a stop sign. The wounded man called a cab to the hospital. He died. A deli worker watched it all. &ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy.

No arrests. The street stayed open for business.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They talk about safety.</strong> But in Belmont, the blood keeps coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half where installed, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring. The city redesigns intersections, but the work is slow. The dead do not wait for ribbon cuttings.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-belongs-to-you>The Next Step Belongs to You</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the speed limit drop to 20 mph. Demand the cameras stay on. Demand streets where children can cross without fear.

Their letter to the Department of Transportation warned, 'Closing any portion of Fordham Road to vehicular traffic will result in many negative consequences to our community.' They argued it would push cars onto residential streets, creating 'endless gridlock and danger for pedestrians.' The Fordham Road Business Improvement District and Feliz led the opposition. Despite their stance, city data shows 86 percent of corridor visitors arrive by walking or transit. DOT polling revealed strong support among residents for improved bus lanes and a car-free busway. Most locals do not own cars and rely on public transit. Transit advocates and DOT officials back the busway, citing better bus speeds and retail sales elsewhere. The proposal remains contested, with vulnerable road users caught in the middle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as an 'existential threat' by Bronx business leaders, questions the impact of restricting car traffic on the busy corridor. Feliz, in a letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, acknowledged slow bus speeds but echoed concerns about diverted traffic and business access. The statement reads: 'Closing any portion of Fordham Road to vehicular traffic will result in many negative consequences... creating endless gridlock and danger for pedestrians.' DOT proposals include full or partial busways, but local surveys show 86% of visitors already arrive by walking, bus, or train. Feliz called for a balanced plan, reflecting ongoing tension between business interests and safer, faster transit for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

Louis, Kalman Yeger, Sandy Nurse, Shahana K. Hanif, and Althea V. Stevens. The bill mandated a four-week comment window and a two-week response period, plus annual reporting and advance notice for temporary changes.
