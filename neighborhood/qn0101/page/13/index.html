Repeat hotspots need repeat fixes.</p><h3 id=citywide-political-solutions>Citywide Political Solutions</h3><p>Local fixes matter. So do citywide rules. Use Sammy’s Law to set a 20 mph default across New York City. Require intelligent speed‑assistance (speed‑limiters) for habitual speeders — the state S4045 proposals move in this direction. Push for both: slower default speeds plus tech that prevents repeat offenders from killing.</p><h3 id=act-now>Act Now</h3><p>Call your council member and state senator.
