They are neighbors, children, parents.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. The council can now lower speed limits to 20 mph.

He is the 11th cyclist killed this year. The street lacks protected bike lanes. Politicians and advocates demand urgent action. City failed to meet legal safety mandates.</p><p class=mb3>On April 11, 2023, a hit-and-run driver killed Jaydan McLaurin, a teenage cyclist, on 21st Street in Astoria, Queens. This corridor is a Vision Zero priority but only has an unprotected bike lane. The crash marks the 11th cyclist death in New York City this year, a record high for this point in the year. Council Member Tiffany Cabán called the loss 'wave after wave of grief and heartbreak' and demanded safer streets for pedestrians and cyclists. Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Danny Harris urged Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez to invest in safe streets and fulfill the NYC Streets Plan’s legal requirements. Advocates noted the Department of Transportation failed to expand bike and bus lanes as required last year. The call is clear: the city must act now to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Michael Gianaris, who said, 'I am glad the city is installing a traffic signal at the site of Naadhun's tragic death, in accordance with her family’s wishes.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'No loss of life on our streets is acceptable.' The DOT has already added curb extensions and new crosswalks. Community members, including Alex Duncan, argue that one signal is not enough and demand systemic safety changes along the corridor.

The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt.

The bill’s summary states: “The department shall conduct and submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council and post conspicuously on the department's website an annual study on bicycle activity.” Council Members Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, Tiffany Cabán, Crystal Hudson, Kevin C. Riley, and Lynn C. Schulman sponsored the measure. The bill would have identified the most biked streets and bridges, noted which lacked protected lanes, and demanded safety recommendations. The council filed the bill at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The bill’s failure leaves cyclists exposed, with no citywide data push to guide urgent fixes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
