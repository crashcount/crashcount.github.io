They are neighbors, children, parents.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. The council can now lower speed limits to 20 mph.

Police found him unconscious on the tracks at 2:45 a.m. and said he was 'either riding the top of a No. 7 train entering the station or attempting to get onto the top.' The article notes six people, mostly teens, died subway surfing last year. This year, three have died. The MTA and NYPD have launched campaigns and drone patrols to deter such incidents, but the deaths continue.
