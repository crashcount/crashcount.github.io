In the last three years, two people lost their lives to traffic violence here. One was a 73-year-old woman, struck by a turning bus in a crosswalk. Another was a 58-year-old man, killed on his e-bike by an SUV. In the same period, five others suffered serious injuries. Four hundred and two people were hurt. These are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, parents, workers.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-broken-bodies>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Broken Bodies</h3><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and trucks.</strong> In Ozone Park, sedans and SUVs caused the most pain—over a dozen serious or moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed and maimed too. Motorcycles and mopeds added to the toll. Not a single cyclist killed anyone. The street is a gauntlet for the vulnerable. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about safety.</strong> The city touts new speed cameras and lower speed limits. But in Ozone Park, the carnage continues. The council and mayor have the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it. Cameras that save lives are at risk if Albany does not act. Each delay is another risk, another family shattered.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a failure of will. The city can act. The state can act. But they move only when pushed.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The MTA demanded $4 billion from the city—a 33% jump from the last plan—warning of major subway disruptions if denied. The matter, titled 'MTA threatens another ‘Summer of Hell’ of subway disruptions if NYC doesn’t cough up billions,' drew sharp words. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Queens) blasted the agency: 'Instead of insulting us with baseless threats, the agency that spends $30 million on a staircase should find ways to cut its wasteful spending and bloated payroll before asking for more taxpayer money.' Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility. Despite heated criticism, council members did not strongly oppose the request in session. The hearing left the city’s most vulnerable riders—those who rely on safe, reliable transit—caught between political fights and crumbling infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and refused a breath test. His blood-alcohol content was 0.156 percent. Surveillance footage confirmed Diaz had the right-of-way. The article notes, 'The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light, prosecutors say.' Pena was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. His license was suspended.

Primary sponsor Luis R. Sepúlveda (District 32) and co-sponsor Joseph P. Addabbo Jr. (District 15) back the measure. S 5801 would require e-scooter riders in New York City to pass a safety manual, obtain a license, and buy insurance. It also bans sales to unlicensed, uninsured buyers.

The bill, not yet numbered, would raise fines from $115 to $1,000 and allow 311 video submissions for automatic summonses. Ariola said, 'We have seen two fires in the past week that have resulted in fatalities where the firefighters were unable to access the closest fire hydrant.' The measure responds to a surge in complaints—over 134,000 in 2023—about blocked hydrants. Ariola’s office blamed lost parking to DOT bike lanes and racks, but the DOT countered, calling protected bike lanes a proven safety tool. FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker said blocked hydrants slowed firefighting in a recent fatal fire.
