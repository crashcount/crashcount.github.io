The call: fund safety now.</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2022, more than a dozen City Council members and advocates gathered at City Hall to demand full funding for the Streets Master Plan. The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began. The mayor’s proposed $98.5-billion budget did not allocate significant funds for the plan. Advocates say the city must act now to stem the bloodshed on its streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Richards</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2022, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced it will add 60 electric buses to its 6,000-bus fleet by the end of the year. The new vehicles will be deployed to six depots across all five boroughs, focusing on 'environmental justice communities' with high asthma rates. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said, 'Fully electrifying our bus fleet is a critical step forward to preserving our environment and protecting our families.' MTA Chairman Janno Lieber called mass transit 'the antidote to climate change.' The rollout, however, is slow. High electricity costs and limited charging infrastructure stall progress. New York State has budgeted $1.1 billion for 500 electric buses in its 2020-2024 capital plan. The MTA aims for a zero-emissions fleet by 2040, but today’s step is small—just 1% of the fleet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New bus lanes, bike upgrades, and a linear park are coming. Officials say it will speed buses and protect walkers and cyclists. But construction lags. Riders and residents wait. Danger persists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a plan to move Q60 buses from the service road to a dedicated mainline lane along Queens Boulevard, between Roosevelt Avenue and Union Turnpike. The project, under the 'Great Streets' program, is split into four phases, with construction for later phases delayed until at least 2024. The matter summary states: 'transform the currently barren median into a linear park to create a safe and easy way of traversing neighborhoods.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards pledged $1 million to the first phase, stating, 'it really creates an unsafe scenario, especially for pedestrians and cyclists.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone said the redesign 'greatly improv[es] pedestrian safety while also drawing a huge number of new cyclists.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives called the delays 'unacceptable.' The plan includes upgraded bike lanes, bus stops, and bus-only lanes, but also adds curbside parking, which could increase congestion. Vulnerable road users remain at risk until the city acts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The violations occurred between May 2020 and April 2022. Brooks-Powers represents Southeast Queens, an area plagued by pedestrian and motorist fatalities. The matter surfaced in April 2022, with Brooks-Powers admitting responsibility for most tickets. She stated, 'public safety is very important to me,' and pledged to improve. Under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, she must complete a safety course or risk car impoundment. Her tickets have been paid, so her car was not towed.

They want double the protected lanes and more pedestrian space. Advocates cheer. The mayor reviews. The fight is over money, but the stakes are lives.</p><p class=mb3>On April 4, 2022, the City Council called on Mayor Adams to add $3.1 billion to the Streets Master Plan. The plan, passed in 2019, aims for 250 protected bike lanes and 150 bus lanes. The Council wants to double these targets: 500 miles each of protected bike and bus lanes, plus 38 million square feet of new pedestrian plazas. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said the goal is 'to make our thoroughfares safer and more accessible, while increasing New York's pedestrian plazas footprint.' The Council’s proposal comes as the mayor’s $98.5-billion budget lacks dedicated funding for these safety upgrades. Advocates for bus and bike infrastructure support the Council’s push. The mayor says he is reviewing the proposal and remains committed to street safety and transit improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Richards</p><p class=mb3>On March 30, 2022, the MTA released a second draft of its Queens bus network redesign. The plan, not tied to a bill number, is a policy proposal under review. It follows backlash to the 2019 draft and pandemic delays. The redesign boosts routes from 77 to 85, adds 20 new lines, and drops the revenue-neutral rule. Hundreds of stops will be cut to speed service. The MTA and NYC DOT picked 49 corridors for upgrades like bus lanes. The official summary states the plan 'incorporates feedback from over 11,000 customer comments and aims to address previous criticisms.' MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'We know we need to get it right this time.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and advocates like Riders Alliance back the effort but call for more equity and engagement.

Riders wait.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2022, Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) joined transit advocates at a rally demanding urgent improvements to New York City's bus system. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the Bus Turnaround coalition's renewed push for dedicated busways, more bus lanes, and increased funding. Restler said, 'We need a real busway on Jay Street,' citing rampant illegal driving and slow service. The rally criticized City Hall for ambitious targets but no concrete plans. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez promised 150 new miles of bus lanes, but advocates noted delays and lack of enforcement. The recommendations aim to speed up buses for vulnerable riders—working-class, immigrant, and communities of color—who rely on slow, unreliable service. The rally underscored the urgent need for action to protect and prioritize those most at risk on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Only 5.5 miles get upgrades now. The rest will wait until late 2023. Advocates and officials praise the move but slam the slow pace. Cyclists remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On February 18, 2022, the Department of Transportation announced a delay in its plan to bolster protected bike lanes. The Adams administration had promised to harden 20 miles of bike lanes within its first 100 days. Now, DOT says the work will finish by the end of 2023. The first phase covers just 5.5 miles in Manhattan and Queens. DOT Commissioner Rodriguez said, “We have an actionable, concrete plan to protect cyclists and we are going to deliver on this work to keep our lanes clear.” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the upgrades, calling for safe biking citywide. Community Board 3’s Michelle Kuppersmith highlighted the need for political will. Still, the delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as the city also postponed pedestrian space on the Queensboro Bridge. The slow rollout means danger lingers for cyclists and walkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Wilfredo Florentino, Brooklyn Community Board 5, says, “Just placing cameras ain't gonna cut it.” The analysis shows that dangerous, wide arterials in communities of color drive up traffic violence.

The report, not tied to a specific bill, reviewed automated enforcement and street design. It found speed cameras are evenly distributed and reduce crashes, but dangerous road design still puts lives at risk. Adams and other leaders called for more cameras and urgent street redesigns, echoing the article’s summary: 'Cameras have led to fewer crashes, injuries, and fatalities, but high numbers of tickets in some neighborhoods are attributed to unsafe road design, not camera placement.' Community voices stressed that automated enforcement helps, but cannot replace permanent fixes to deadly streets. The Department of Transportation’s lack of transparency on camera locations remains a concern.
