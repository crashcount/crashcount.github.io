Five hundred two injured.</strong> That is the ledger for Far Rockaway-Bayswater since 2022. Three people suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. The dead include a child, elders, and working-age adults. The living carry scars—broken bones, lost work, empty chairs at dinner. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses took one more. Motorcycles and bikes left their own marks, but the big machines do the worst damage.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-change>Patterns That Do Not Change</h3><p><strong>Crashes do not slow down.</strong> In the last year, 376 crashes tore through these streets. One person died. One was seriously hurt. Children, teens, and elders are all in the count. The violence is not random. It is relentless.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians pay the highest price.</strong> They die at intersections, on sidewalks, in crosswalks. They are hit by drivers going straight, turning, or just not looking. The numbers do not lie. The street is not safe for those on foot.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. Street redesigns. But in Far Rockaway-Bayswater, the pace of change is slow. The law now allows the city to drop speed limits to 20 mph. It has not happened here. Cameras work, but only where they are installed. The silence from local leaders is loud. Each delay means another family risks loss.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is policy. It is choice. Residents can call their council member, demand lower speed limits, demand more cameras, demand streets built for people, not just cars. Every day of delay is another day the numbers grow.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders.

An opinion from a Transportation Alternatives staffer urged the Council to 'transform impervious driving lanes into green climate solutions.' The piece calls for bioswales and greenspace in place of parking, citing the deadly floods after Hurricane Ida. It highlights that 72 percent of city land is impervious, worsening flash floods. The author presses city leaders, including Mayor Eric Adams, to repurpose street space for climate resilience, referencing the NYC 25x25 challenge. The message is clear: 'Our streets can become the solution to climate change and flooding.'

The bill aimed to 'establish priority for sidewalk repairs at developments operated by the New York City Housing Authority,' giving first priority to senior-only NYCHA buildings, then to other NYCHA sites. Emergencies at non-NYCHA properties could override this order, with required notification to local officials. The bill required DOT to report on completed and pending NYCHA sidewalk repairs by June 30, 2023. Council Member Alexa Avilés sponsored the bill, joined by Abreu, Brooks-Powers, Restler, Hanif, Won, Nurse, Gutiérrez, and Sanchez. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without enactment.

They want trains running where weeds grow. They reject inflated costs. They say transit equity matters. They press for action, not delay. Riders wait. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On August 5, 2022, fifteen elected officials and two community board chairs from Queens signed a letter demanding Governor Hochul and Mayor Adams fund an environmental impact study (EIS) for the QueensLink subway expansion. The proposal, discussed in the City Council’s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, seeks to restore service on the abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch, connecting Rego Park and Ozone Park. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, committee chair, emphasized, 'Transportation equity is a major issue in our city that must be confronted.' The letter criticizes the MTA’s previous cost estimates and compares QueensLink’s need to the state-backed Interborough Express. Supporters argue that if the state can spend $1 billion widening the Van Wyck Expressway, it can fund a study for transit. The EIS would include community engagement to address local concerns. The push is clear: more transit, fewer cars, safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers, Transportation Chair, joined Councilmember Ari Kagan and DOT officials at Surf Avenue and West 37th Street. The matter: 'Surf Avenue gets new crosswalk and four-way stop sign, creating a safer intersection for seniors.' Kagan’s office led the push, with Brooks-Powers elevating the issue. Kagan said, 'It was one of the most dangerous intersections in Coney Island, not just for pedestrians but for drivers as well.' The crossing serves the Scheuer House senior facility. Community Board 13 and local groups demanded action. Brooks-Powers praised the advocacy: 'Now, your residents will be able to cross the street safely!' The intersection, once life-threatening, now offers basic protection for the city’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) launched the one-year, 24/7 busway pilot to speed up commutes for over 250,000 daily bus riders. Williams called her district a 'car community' and argued, 'there's only one metric of success for the bus lane and not looking comprehensively at how it's actually impacting the community.' Brooks-Powers claimed, 'People cannot access our local businesses.' Both members urged the city to end or shorten the pilot, citing business and driver complaints. DOT and transit advocates countered that bus speeds improved. The DOT plans to continue the pilot and survey businesses and riders at its end.

The resolution calls on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to remediate any transportation structure, primarily elevated train lines, with extremely high levels of lead. Council Member Sandy Nurse led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Cabán, Hanif, Abreu, Louis, Holden, Gutiérrez, Joseph, Won, Brewer, and Lee. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The resolution cites studies showing lead levels in paint chips from elevated tracks far above legal limits. The council demands action to protect New Yorkers from toxic exposure. The MTA, a state-run agency, holds the power to act. The bill’s filing leaves the hazard unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets still wait for real protection.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2022, the City Council and Mayor Adams reached a budget agreement, allocating $53 million in operating funds for the Department of Transportation for the fiscal year starting July 1. This is a down payment on the mayor's promised $904 million for the Streets Master Plan, but falls short of the Council's $3.1 billion ask to double the plan's targets. The plan mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes, 150 miles of dedicated bus lanes, and new public plazas. The official matter summary notes, 'the agreement provided far less for street safety projects than the Council originally sought.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams announced the deal, but neither mentioned street safety in their press conference. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, did not comment. Advocates praised the funding as a significant step, but stressed the need for strong implementation to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
