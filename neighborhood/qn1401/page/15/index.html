Five hundred two injured.</strong> That is the ledger for Far Rockaway-Bayswater since 2022. Three people suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. The dead include a child, elders, and working-age adults. The living carry scars—broken bones, lost work, empty chairs at dinner. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses took one more. Motorcycles and bikes left their own marks, but the big machines do the worst damage.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-change>Patterns That Do Not Change</h3><p><strong>Crashes do not slow down.</strong> In the last year, 376 crashes tore through these streets. One person died. One was seriously hurt. Children, teens, and elders are all in the count. The violence is not random. It is relentless.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians pay the highest price.</strong> They die at intersections, on sidewalks, in crosswalks. They are hit by drivers going straight, turning, or just not looking. The numbers do not lie. The street is not safe for those on foot.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. Street redesigns. But in Far Rockaway-Bayswater, the pace of change is slow. The law now allows the city to drop speed limits to 20 mph. It has not happened here. Cameras work, but only where they are installed. The silence from local leaders is loud. Each delay means another family risks loss.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is policy. It is choice. Residents can call their council member, demand lower speed limits, demand more cameras, demand streets built for people, not just cars. Every day of delay is another day the numbers grow.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Royster later clarified she referred only to tickets for driving in bike lanes, a small slice of total enforcement. Combined, bike lane enforcement was still down over 4 percent. Brooks-Powers questioned enforcement against illegally parked tractor-trailers. Royster cited fine amounts but gave no enforcement numbers. Data showed code 78 and code 6 violations both dropped sharply. Royster's answers were vague, lacking specifics on enforcement or safety.

Few students get lessons now. The Department of Education drags its feet. Advocates want more: protected lanes, safe routes. Drivers hold the real power. Kids need more than lessons. They need safe streets.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2022, Council Members Erik Bottcher, Rita Joseph, and Selvena Brooks-Powers introduced a resolution urging the Department of Education to teach bicycle safety in all New York City public schools. The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.' The council’s action highlights a gap between policy and real safety for children on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began. The mayor’s proposed $98.5-billion budget did not allocate significant funds for the plan.
