Five hundred two injured.</strong> That is the ledger for Far Rockaway-Bayswater since 2022. Three people suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. The dead include a child, elders, and working-age adults. The living carry scars—broken bones, lost work, empty chairs at dinner. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses took one more. Motorcycles and bikes left their own marks, but the big machines do the worst damage.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-change>Patterns That Do Not Change</h3><p><strong>Crashes do not slow down.</strong> In the last year, 376 crashes tore through these streets. One person died. One was seriously hurt. Children, teens, and elders are all in the count. The violence is not random. It is relentless.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians pay the highest price.</strong> They die at intersections, on sidewalks, in crosswalks. They are hit by drivers going straight, turning, or just not looking. The numbers do not lie. The street is not safe for those on foot.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. Street redesigns. But in Far Rockaway-Bayswater, the pace of change is slow. The law now allows the city to drop speed limits to 20 mph. It has not happened here. Cameras work, but only where they are installed. The silence from local leaders is loud. Each delay means another family risks loss.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is policy. It is choice. Residents can call their council member, demand lower speed limits, demand more cameras, demand streets built for people, not just cars. Every day of delay is another day the numbers grow.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The victim died on June 11. The crash happened in Council District 31, represented by Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers. The intersection lacks stop signs or a traffic light. A speed camera there issued over 600 tickets in 2021. Transportation Alternatives calls the district the city’s deadliest: six road deaths in early 2023, more than 10 percent of city fatalities, and the highest fatality rate per resident. The driver stayed at the scene. Police gave no details. No charges were filed. The street’s design and lack of enforcement leave pedestrians exposed and unprotected.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest.

Lives depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0854-2022, now enacted as Local Law 66 of 2023, passed the City Council on April 27, 2023, after review by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The law requires the Department of Transportation to 'implement daylighting at a minimum of 100 intersections a year,' meaning no parking within 15 feet of corners. High-crash intersections must be prioritized unless deemed infeasible. DOT must also install physical daylighting features, such as planters or bike corrals, where possible. Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hudson, Ossé, and others. The law took effect 90 days after enactment. DOT must report annually on locations and reasons for any exceptions. This measure targets the blind spots that kill and injure pedestrians and cyclists at intersections. The city’s streets will see more open corners and fewer hiding places for danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill amends the administrative code to require the Department of Transportation to conduct a comprehensive study of all pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries every three years, instead of every five.

It now covers more area near schools. The NYPD, represented by Director of Legislative Affairs Michael Clarke, opposed the bill, warning of possible assaults and harassment. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said his agency is open to talks after earlier resistance. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, committee chair, voiced concerns about public conflict. Restler insisted, 'People are dying on our streets. This will save lives.' Advocates remain divided.

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a reckless driver in 2013, has stalled in Albany despite mounting pressure. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, co-sponsored by Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler. Adams, however, said, 'We’re going to let the state do what the state does in response to Sammy’s Law,' and focused on other budget priorities. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.
