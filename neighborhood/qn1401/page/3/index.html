Five hundred two injured.</strong> That is the ledger for Far Rockaway-Bayswater since 2022. Three people suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. The dead include a child, elders, and working-age adults. The living carry scars—broken bones, lost work, empty chairs at dinner. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses took one more. Motorcycles and bikes left their own marks, but the big machines do the worst damage.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-change>Patterns That Do Not Change</h3><p><strong>Crashes do not slow down.</strong> In the last year, 376 crashes tore through these streets. One person died. One was seriously hurt. Children, teens, and elders are all in the count. The violence is not random. It is relentless.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians pay the highest price.</strong> They die at intersections, on sidewalks, in crosswalks. They are hit by drivers going straight, turning, or just not looking. The numbers do not lie. The street is not safe for those on foot.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. Street redesigns. But in Far Rockaway-Bayswater, the pace of change is slow. The law now allows the city to drop speed limits to 20 mph. It has not happened here. Cameras work, but only where they are installed. The silence from local leaders is loud. Each delay means another family risks loss.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is policy. It is choice. Residents can call their council member, demand lower speed limits, demand more cameras, demand streets built for people, not just cars. Every day of delay is another day the numbers grow.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders.

DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione objected, claiming the tracker would add paperwork and reduce community engagement. Brooks-Powers countered, "DOT needs to be more transparent about its project pipeline so we can identify bottlenecks." The committee signaled intent to advance the bill.
