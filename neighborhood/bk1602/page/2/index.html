Eleven seriously hurt. A thousand injured.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Brownsville since 2022. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A 72-year-old man, Larry Maxwell, was killed crossing Sutter Avenue on his way to a family cookout. The driver who hit him kept going. His son, Larnce Vargas, stood at the scene and <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>asked why, with so many cameras, the driver is still at large</a>. The city’s eyes are everywhere, but justice is not.</p><p>A few months earlier, 26-year-old Imani Vance died in the front seat of a Mercedes. The driver ran a stop sign, hit a school bus, and left her behind. Brooklyn’s District Attorney called it a <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/driver-charged-east-new-york-hit-and-run/>&ldquo;shocking disregard for human life and safety, made worse by his attempt to flee the scene instead of helping the victim.&rdquo;</a> The bus driver survived. Vance did not.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-speed-disregard-and-delay>The Pattern: Speed, Disregard, and Delay</h3><p><strong>Crashes are not random.</strong> In the last year, Brownsville saw 231 crashes, 154 injuries, and 2 deaths. Most victims were young adults. Pedestrians crossing with the signal were struck. Cyclists were hit by SUVs. Children were hurt on their way to school. Cars and trucks caused the most harm, but mopeds and buses played their part. The streets do not forgive mistakes.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They praise new laws and cameras. But the cameras did not stop the driver who killed Larry Maxwell. The laws did not save Imani Vance. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word on renewal. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Residents can call their council member. They can demand a 20 mph speed limit. They can push for speed cameras that work, for streets that protect the people who walk and bike. The dead cannot speak. The living must. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article states, “After the crash, Epps hopped in a taxi and took off, leaving his 26-year-old passenger, Imani Vance, in the front seat suffering severe head trauma.” Epps faces charges of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, leaving the scene, and unlicensed driving. The bus driver survived. The crash exposes ongoing risks from unlicensed, reckless drivers and the persistent danger at city intersections.

Metal screamed. The front passenger, a 26-year-old woman, died in her seat. Head wounds ended everything. She never saw it coming. The driver had no license.</p><p class=mb3>A deadly crash unfolded on Van Sinderen Avenue near Blake Avenue in Brooklyn when, according to the police report, a sedan traveling at 'unsafe speed' collided with a bus and then struck a parked box truck. The report states the sedan's front passenger, a 26-year-old woman, suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The sedan's driver was unlicensed, as documented in the official vehicle records. The police report attributes the primary contributing factor to 'Unsafe Speed.' The narrative describes the sedan as 'slammed into a bus, then a parked box truck,' underscoring the violent sequence. No contributing factors related to the victim's behavior are cited in the report. The focus remains on the unlicensed driver’s excessive speed and the systemic danger posed by unqualified motorists operating vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bicyclist, who was not wearing safety equipment, was injured with knee, lower leg, and foot trauma and was reported to be in shock with complaints of pain or nausea. The report lists unspecified contributing factors but highlights the sedan’s left turn maneuver as the critical action preceding the collision. No driver errors such as failure to yield are explicitly cited, but the turning vehicle’s movement directly caused the crash. The bicyclist was not ejected and sustained moderate injuries. This crash underscores the dangers posed by turning vehicles to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
