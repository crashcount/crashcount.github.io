Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last three and a half years, Brownsville’s streets have not been quiet. The numbers do not flinch: 4 killed, 12 seriously injured, and 1,005 hurt in 1,720 crashes since 2022, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Children are not spared. In the past year alone, 20 kids were injured in crashes. The deadliest wounds are not always visible.</p><p><strong>The faces behind the numbers are not forgotten.</strong> In May, Larry Maxwell, 72, was struck and killed on Sutter Avenue. He was on his way to a family cookout. The driver fled. His son, Larnce Vargas, stood at the scene and asked, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>“There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large?”</a> The city’s eyes are everywhere, but justice is not.</p><p>In February, a Mercedes driver with no license ran a stop sign, slammed into a school bus, and left his passenger, Imani Vance, dying in the front seat. The driver ran. Brooklyn’s District Attorney called it <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-driver-indicted-accused-of-deadly-hit-and-run-school-bus-crash>“a shocking disregard for human life and safety, made worse by his attempt to flee the scene instead of helping the victim.”</a></p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p><strong>Laws have changed. Streets have not.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But in Brownsville, the pace of change is slow. Speed cameras work, but only where they are installed. Enforcement is uneven. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. The driver who killed Larry Maxwell is still free.</p><p>Local leaders have words. They promise safer streets. But the bodies keep coming. The city’s own data shows the carnage is not random. It is routine.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every loophole, every missing camera is a choice. The city can lower speed limits. It can harden crosswalks. It can demand real accountability for reckless drivers. But it will not move unless pushed.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand speed cameras on every block. Demand justice for every family left waiting.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Most accept crashes and pollution as normal. The same harms spark outrage elsewhere. This double standard leaves pedestrians and cyclists in the crosshairs. The culture shields drivers, not victims.</p><p class=mb3>On January 19, 2023, researchers published a report in the Journal of Environment and Health, dissecting public attitudes toward driving dangers. The study, led by environmental psychologist Ian Walker, surveyed over 2,000 British adults. It found that 61 percent of respondents accepted driving risks as natural, while far fewer tolerated similar hazards at work or from smoking. The article, titled 'The Dangers of Driving Are Way More Normalized Than We Think,' highlights what Walker calls 'motonormativity'—a cultural blind spot that excuses harm from cars. Walker urges policy changes: 'Build a street where people can't speed... you won't have speeding.' The research shows that society’s deep-rooted car bias endangers vulnerable road users and blocks reforms that could save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous.

The mayor returned it unsigned.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0291-2022, now Local Law 115 of 2022, was enacted by the City Council on November 27, 2022. The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to require every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter, and other legal motorized vehicle to be registered with the Department of Transportation and display a visible license plate. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.' Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections. The streets stayed dangerous. The cars kept their edge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
