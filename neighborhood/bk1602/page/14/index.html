Fifteen seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the count in Brownsville since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or habit. They only rise. In the past twelve months, four people lost their lives here. Three were between 25 and 34. One was over 65. <strong>Children are not spared:</strong> 37 injured in the last year alone.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was crushed at Newport Street and Rockaway Avenue. A 40-year-old man, hip and leg broken, pinned by a car. The week before, a child was hit on Herzl Street. The driver was distracted. The child bled on the pavement. <strong>Every week, another family waits in the ER.</strong></p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed one person and injured 169 more on Brownsville’s streets. Trucks and buses hit 14. Motorcycles and mopeds, two. Bikes, three. The numbers are plain. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. Council Member Darlene Mealy co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. It could save lives, if enforced. State Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes to extend school speed zones. He also backed a bill to force repeat speeders to install limiters on their cars (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>File S 4045</a>). But the streets are still not safe. <strong>The deaths keep coming.</strong></p><p>Neighbors see it. After a hit-and-run killed two men in Brooklyn, a local said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>&ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</a> The city knows. The numbers do not lie.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. <strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras. Demand streets for people, not just cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill creates first responder safety zones. It sets speed limits in these zones. Lawmakers act after crashes and close calls. The vote is strong. The danger is real. The streets demand change.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 6808, titled 'Relates to establishing first responder safety zones and setting speed limits in such safety zones,' moved through committee and passed multiple Senate votes between May 2023 and March 2024. Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way. The bill targets that risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
