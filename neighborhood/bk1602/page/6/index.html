Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last three and a half years, Brownsville’s streets have not been quiet. The numbers do not flinch: 4 killed, 12 seriously injured, and 1,005 hurt in 1,720 crashes since 2022, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Children are not spared. In the past year alone, 20 kids were injured in crashes. The deadliest wounds are not always visible.</p><p><strong>The faces behind the numbers are not forgotten.</strong> In May, Larry Maxwell, 72, was struck and killed on Sutter Avenue. He was on his way to a family cookout. The driver fled. His son, Larnce Vargas, stood at the scene and asked, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>“There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large?”</a> The city’s eyes are everywhere, but justice is not.</p><p>In February, a Mercedes driver with no license ran a stop sign, slammed into a school bus, and left his passenger, Imani Vance, dying in the front seat. The driver ran. Brooklyn’s District Attorney called it <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-driver-indicted-accused-of-deadly-hit-and-run-school-bus-crash>“a shocking disregard for human life and safety, made worse by his attempt to flee the scene instead of helping the victim.”</a></p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p><strong>Laws have changed. Streets have not.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But in Brownsville, the pace of change is slow. Speed cameras work, but only where they are installed. Enforcement is uneven. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. The driver who killed Larry Maxwell is still free.</p><p>Local leaders have words. They promise safer streets. But the bodies keep coming. The city’s own data shows the carnage is not random. It is routine.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every loophole, every missing camera is a choice. The city can lower speed limits. It can harden crosswalks. It can demand real accountability for reckless drivers. But it will not move unless pushed.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand speed cameras on every block. Demand justice for every family left waiting.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They protested Governor Kathy Hochul’s June 5 decision to suspend congestion pricing, a move that froze $16.5 billion in MTA upgrades, including elevators for Bed-Stuy’s busy station. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the urgent need for accessibility: 'We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now,' said State Sen. Jabari Brisport. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible.

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.
