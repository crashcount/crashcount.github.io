Eight seriously hurt.</strong> In East Flushing, from 2022 through early June 2025, the numbers keep coming. They do not stop. They do not care. In 514 crashes, 272 people were injured. Two did not come home. Eight carry wounds that will not heal. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, workers, and neighbors. In the last year alone, 84 people were hurt on these streets. Three were left with life-changing injuries. Not one death, but the luck will not last. The next siren is always coming.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs hit most often. Trucks and buses do their share. One bike, one bus, one taxi—each leaves a mark. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. The street does not care if you are young or old. It does not care if you are careful.</p><p><strong>The stories repeat.</strong> A sedan making a left turn hits a woman in the crosswalk. A distracted driver strikes a child on a bike. A truck backs up and a pedestrian goes down. The details change. The outcome does not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>recent crashes</a></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new laws. They point to speed cameras and lower limits. But the blood on the street says more. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so here. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are placed. The rest of the street is left to chance.</p><p><strong>No bold action. No end to the toll.</strong> The council, the mayor, the state—they all have a hand. They can act. They have not done enough. The numbers prove it.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every delay is another family at risk. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The message: don’t drink and drive.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2023, Queens State Senator John Liu, representing District 16, publicly supported a bill in the State Legislature to lower the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for drivers from 0.08 to 0.05. The bill’s summary states, 'The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.' Liu, as the bill’s primary sponsor, emphasized that anyone found with a BAC over 0.05 would be charged with DWI. City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez joined the push, warning, 'Whether they are at 0.06 or 0.12 or 0.20, the consequences can be deadly.' Drunk driving caused 307 deaths in New York State in 2019, nearly a third of all fatal crashes. Utah’s adoption of a 0.05 BAC limit led to a 20% drop in fatal crashes in its first year. The bill is part of a broader effort to protect pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
