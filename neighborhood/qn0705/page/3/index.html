Eight seriously hurt.</strong> In East Flushing, from 2022 through early June 2025, the numbers keep coming. They do not stop. They do not care. In 514 crashes, 272 people were injured. Two did not come home. Eight carry wounds that will not heal. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, workers, and neighbors. In the last year alone, 84 people were hurt on these streets. Three were left with life-changing injuries. Not one death, but the luck will not last. The next siren is always coming.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs hit most often. Trucks and buses do their share. One bike, one bus, one taxi—each leaves a mark. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. The street does not care if you are young or old. It does not care if you are careful.</p><p><strong>The stories repeat.</strong> A sedan making a left turn hits a woman in the crosswalk. A distracted driver strikes a child on a bike. A truck backs up and a pedestrian goes down. The details change. The outcome does not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>recent crashes</a></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new laws. They point to speed cameras and lower limits. But the blood on the street says more. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so here. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are placed. The rest of the street is left to chance.</p><p><strong>No bold action. No end to the toll.</strong> The council, the mayor, the state—they all have a hand. They can act. They have not done enough.

The white Toyota sedan hit an underpass near 225th Street around 3:50 a.m. Both occupants were found outside the wreck when police arrived. Investigators are unsure who was driving at the time of impact: 'Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven't figured out who was driving, police said.' The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive. The article highlights ongoing uncertainty about driver identity and underscores the persistent risks on city highways, especially where loss of vehicle control leads to deadly outcomes.

Riders and vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On February 2, 2025, NYC officials responded to reports of a federal move to repeal congestion pricing, just weeks after its January 5 launch. At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff. This is basic transit maintenance.” Liu said losing congestion pricing would erase a billion dollars in annual MTA revenue, threatening $15 billion in planned upgrades. The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily. Both officials opposed the repeal, highlighting the risk to the city’s transit backbone. The bill is not numbered, but the threat is clear: without congestion pricing, the city’s streets and subways grow more dangerous for everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill summary states it will 'establish clear guidelines and help ensure that our local publications get to maintain their newsracks while also helping to alleviate sidewalk congestion.' Bottcher’s action brings new requirements: owners must display contact information, and the Department of Transportation gains authority to set size, shape, and material standards.

Rozic said, 'Affordability is really the most important thing that voters, that constituents, that people on the street, talk to us about... keep the pause.' Opponents argue the toll will worsen economic pain in areas with high storefront vacancy. Despite the uproar, the policy’s impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety remains unaddressed in this debate.

It limits parking for tractor-trailer combinations, tractors, truck trailers, and semi-trailers to 90 minutes, down from three hours. Council Member Kevin C. Riley leads as primary sponsor, joined by Nantasha M. Williams, Darlene Mealy, Sandy Nurse, and others. The bill was referred to committee the day it was introduced. No safety analyst has yet assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the measure aims to keep large trucks from blocking curbs and crosswalks, where they threaten pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Two station wagons/SUVs were involved. One driver was backing with impact at the center back end, while the other was traveling south going straight ahead, hitting with the right front bumper. The contributing factor cited was unsafe speed. A 38-year-old female passenger in one of the vehicles was injured, sustaining chest injuries and experiencing shock. She was not ejected but complained of pain or nausea. Both drivers were licensed in New York.

The bill was introduced on September 12, 2024, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure the same day. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the operation of shared electric scooter systems on certain streets in the Borough of Queens.' Council Members Lynn C. Schulman (District 29, primary sponsor) and Sandra Ung (District 20, co-sponsor) back the measure. The bill would stop shared e-scooter organizations from operating in a dense, contested part of Queens. No safety analysis was provided. The legislation draws a hard line on who can move—and how—on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
