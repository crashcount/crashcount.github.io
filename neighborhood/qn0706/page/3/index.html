Five left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In Queensboro Hill, from January 2022 to June 2025, the numbers do not lie. There have been <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>656 crashes</a>, 383 injuries, and 2 deaths. Five people suffered injuries so severe they are counted as serious. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in their bodies.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are not spared. <strong>One woman, 68, was killed crossing Main Street.</strong> A sedan, moving too fast, struck her down. Another man, 82, was hit in a crosswalk. He lived, but not without pain. A cyclist, 49, thrown from his bike, face bloodied, after a crash on Peck Avenue. The details are in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>records</a>.

They have power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the right to lower speed limits. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But in Queensboro Hill, the speed remains the same. The law sits unused. The clock ticks. <a href=../../take_action/>Speed cameras</a> work, but their future is always in question. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p>No public statements. No bold redesigns. No new protections for the most vulnerable. The silence is loud. The numbers keep rising.</p><h3 id=the-road-forward>The Road Forward</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made somewhere—by a driver, by a planner, by a lawmaker who did not act. The tools exist. Lower the speed. Harden the crossings. Protect the people who walk and ride.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Riders and vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On February 2, 2025, NYC officials responded to reports of a federal move to repeal congestion pricing, just weeks after its January 5 launch. At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff. This is basic transit maintenance.” Liu said losing congestion pricing would erase a billion dollars in annual MTA revenue, threatening $15 billion in planned upgrades. The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily. Both officials opposed the repeal, highlighting the risk to the city’s transit backbone. The bill is not numbered, but the threat is clear: without congestion pricing, the city’s streets and subways grow more dangerous for everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bottcher’s action brings new requirements: owners must display contact information, and the Department of Transportation gains authority to set size, shape, and material standards.

The matter, described as 'NYC congestion toll would hit neighborhoods with some of worst vacancy rates in city,' has drawn fire from both Republicans and Democrats. Rozic said, 'Affordability is really the most important thing that voters, that constituents, that people on the street, talk to us about... keep the pause.'

The report identifies driver inattention and distraction as the primary contributing factors, along with following too closely. The sedan's driver failed to maintain proper attention and distance, resulting in the collision. The bicyclist's safety equipment status is unknown, and no contributing factors related to the victim were noted.

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers. Streets belong to people again.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now Local Law 98 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 26, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
