Five more are seriously hurt.</strong> Since 2022, there have been <strong>693 crashes</strong>—each one a story of pain, each one a warning ignored. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. A sedan killed a 68-year-old woman crossing Main Street. The record shows the cause: <strong>&ldquo;Unsafe Speed&rdquo;</strong> and a body broken, &ldquo;Apparent Death&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just this spring, an 82-year-old man was hit in a crosswalk. The driver failed to yield. The man survived, but not without injury. <strong>&ldquo;Crush Injuries&rdquo;</strong> is all the record says. No comfort in the details.</p><h2 id=buses-bikes-and-broken-promises>Buses, Bikes, and Broken Promises</h2><p>The danger is not just from cars. In July, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb, smashing a pole and injuring eight. One rider <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>described the chaos</a>: <strong>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb&mldr; I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus&rdquo;</strong>. The driver, new to the job, may have fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation drags on.</p><p>Bikes and e-bikes are not spared. A 49-year-old cyclist was thrown from his e-bike on Peck Avenue. The cause: <strong>&ldquo;Unsafe Speed&rdquo;</strong>. The injury: &ldquo;Severe Bleeding&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The street does not care who bleeds.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-what-comes-next>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and What Comes Next</h2><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Senator John Liu <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to curb repeat speeders</a>, backing a bill to require speed-limiting tech for drivers with a record of violations. Assembly Member Nily Rozic <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored the same bill</a>. But the deaths keep coming.</p><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, bodies broken, families left to pick up the pieces.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A 45-year-old female pedestrian was crossing with the signal when a 2013 Kia sedan, driven southbound by an unlicensed male driver, made an improper left turn. The driver failed to yield right-of-way and struck the pedestrian at the intersection, impacting her head and causing abrasions. The vehicle sustained damage to its left front bumper. The report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Turning Improperly' as contributing factors. The pedestrian was conscious and injured but no fault is attributed to her actions.
