Five left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In Queensboro Hill, from January 2022 to June 2025, the numbers do not lie. There have been <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>656 crashes</a>, 383 injuries, and 2 deaths. Five people suffered injuries so severe they are counted as serious. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in their bodies.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are not spared. <strong>One woman, 68, was killed crossing Main Street.</strong> A sedan, moving too fast, struck her down. Another man, 82, was hit in a crosswalk. He lived, but not without pain. A cyclist, 49, thrown from his bike, face bloodied, after a crash on Peck Avenue. The details are in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>records</a>.

They have power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the right to lower speed limits. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But in Queensboro Hill, the speed remains the same. The law sits unused. The clock ticks. <a href=../../take_action/>Speed cameras</a> work, but their future is always in question. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p>No public statements. No bold redesigns. No new protections for the most vulnerable. The silence is loud. The numbers keep rising.</p><h3 id=the-road-forward>The Road Forward</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made somewhere—by a driver, by a planner, by a lawmaker who did not act. The tools exist. Lower the speed. Harden the crossings. Protect the people who walk and ride.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and NYPD’s Kim Royster also spoke, focusing on enforcement and urging drivers to avoid drinking before driving. Advocates like Alisa McMorris of Mothers Against Drunk Driving called for stronger messaging: 'We want people to make choices before they leave their home.' Despite evidence that lowering the threshold could cut traffic deaths by 10%, city messaging still stops short of telling people not to drive to events where they plan to drink.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

John Liu and Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, seeks to lower New York’s drunk driving threshold from 0.08 to 0.05 percent BAC. Announced at a December 22, 2022 press conference, the bill has stalled in committee for years. The matter aims to redefine DWI: 'driving while intoxicated would be defined as anything above a blood-alcohol content of 0.05 percent.' Simon and Liu back the measure; city DOT and NYPD leaders joined them. DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' In 2021, 42 people died in drunk driving crashes, up 60 percent from previous years. Officials promise enforcement and education, but their messaging targets drinking, not the act of driving.

The bill required agencies to notify council members, community boards, and business districts before removing a traffic lane or parking for 500 feet or three blocks for at least a week. The matter summary reads: 'providing notice and an opportunity for comment before implementing a major traffic change.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor), Francisco P. Moya, Sandra Ung, and Pierina Ana Sanchez backed the bill. It was filed at the end of session, never enacted. The bill would have given local officials ten days to respond to proposed changes, but exempted urgent safety actions. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s fate leaves the status quo: agencies can still act without local input.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislative session nears its end with no clear action. State Sen. Jabari Brisport supports the bill, calling for round-the-clock enforcement. Sen. John Liu backs maintaining cameras but won’t commit to S5602. Some City Council members demand that camera revenue fund local road improvements. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried doubts the Council will send the required home rule message in time, while Assembly Member William Magnarelli promises to advance the bill if they do. Mayor Adams’ team claims safety was discussed in Albany, but the mayor himself stayed silent. The bill faces opposition over increased penalties and insurance notifications. Without action, the city’s speed cameras—and the safety of its streets—are at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Traffic camera renewal hangs by a thread. Lawmakers cite weak outreach. Speed and red light cameras may go dark. Vulnerable New Yorkers face rising danger. The mayor’s team scrambles, but time runs out.</p><p class=mb3>On May 10, 2022, critics blasted Mayor Eric Adams’ Albany efforts to secure key NYC priorities, including the renewal and expansion of speed and red light camera programs. The matter, covered in the article 'Critics slam Eric Adams’ Albany efforts on NYC priorities,' highlights City Hall’s inconsistent lobbying as the legislative session neared its end. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez was sent to push for stalled camera legislation, but lawmakers like State Sen. John Liu said the mayor’s direct engagement was lacking. Andrea Stewart-Cousins, mentioned in the coverage, is a key Albany figure. The bill’s fate remains uncertain. If the cameras expire, enforcement near schools vanishes, exposing pedestrians and cyclists to greater risk. The city’s last-minute push may not be enough to protect its most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
