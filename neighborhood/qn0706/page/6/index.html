Five left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In Queensboro Hill, from January 2022 to June 2025, the numbers do not lie. There have been <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>656 crashes</a>, 383 injuries, and 2 deaths. Five people suffered injuries so severe they are counted as serious. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in their bodies.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are not spared. <strong>One woman, 68, was killed crossing Main Street.</strong> A sedan, moving too fast, struck her down. Another man, 82, was hit in a crosswalk. He lived, but not without pain. A cyclist, 49, thrown from his bike, face bloodied, after a crash on Peck Avenue. The details are in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>records</a>.

They have power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the right to lower speed limits. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But in Queensboro Hill, the speed remains the same. The law sits unused. The clock ticks. <a href=../../take_action/>Speed cameras</a> work, but their future is always in question. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p>No public statements. No bold redesigns. No new protections for the most vulnerable. The silence is loud. The numbers keep rising.</p><h3 id=the-road-forward>The Road Forward</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made somewhere—by a driver, by a planner, by a lawmaker who did not act. The tools exist. Lower the speed. Harden the crossings. Protect the people who walk and ride.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.
