Five more are seriously hurt.</strong> Since 2022, there have been <strong>693 crashes</strong>—each one a story of pain, each one a warning ignored. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. A sedan killed a 68-year-old woman crossing Main Street. The record shows the cause: <strong>&ldquo;Unsafe Speed&rdquo;</strong> and a body broken, &ldquo;Apparent Death&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just this spring, an 82-year-old man was hit in a crosswalk. The driver failed to yield. The man survived, but not without injury. <strong>&ldquo;Crush Injuries&rdquo;</strong> is all the record says. No comfort in the details.</p><h2 id=buses-bikes-and-broken-promises>Buses, Bikes, and Broken Promises</h2><p>The danger is not just from cars. In July, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb, smashing a pole and injuring eight. One rider <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>described the chaos</a>: <strong>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb&mldr; I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus&rdquo;</strong>. The driver, new to the job, may have fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation drags on.</p><p>Bikes and e-bikes are not spared. A 49-year-old cyclist was thrown from his e-bike on Peck Avenue. The cause: <strong>&ldquo;Unsafe Speed&rdquo;</strong>. The injury: &ldquo;Severe Bleeding&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The street does not care who bleeds.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-what-comes-next>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and What Comes Next</h2><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Senator John Liu <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to curb repeat speeders</a>, backing a bill to require speed-limiting tech for drivers with a record of violations. Assembly Member Nily Rozic <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored the same bill</a>. But the deaths keep coming.</p><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, bodies broken, families left to pick up the pieces.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
