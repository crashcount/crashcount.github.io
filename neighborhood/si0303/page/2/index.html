Two suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, bodies broken, families left with empty chairs.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians do not stand a chance against steel.</strong> SUVs and sedans have struck down walkers at intersections and in the open street. One woman, 69, was crossing with no signal. She left the scene with her head bleeding, the SUV that hit her turning left, the driver distracted and failing to yield. Another, just 20, was hit by a sedan making a right turn. The data does not say if she screamed. It only says she was left with severe lacerations. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>The carnage is not fate.

Their names are listed among those who chose to let the cameras go dark.</p><p>When asked, the city says it is investigating. After an 80-year-old man was killed crossing Hylan Boulevard, police said they were &ldquo;still investigating how fast the woman was driving and what the traffic signals at the intersection were displaying at the time.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>Gothamist</a> The dead man cannot answer.</p><h3 id=the-silence-of-power>The Silence of Power</h3><p><strong>Bills have been introduced.</strong> Some would lower e-bike speeds, others would force operators to display safety rules. But the bills that matter most—the ones that would slow cars, redesign streets, and keep repeat speeders off the road—stall or die. The silence is loud.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed an 80-year-old man who was walking across a busy Staten Island street a block from his home, police said Monday.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>Gothamist</a></p><p><strong>&ldquo;Police officials said the man, neighborhood resident Chaosheng Wu, was crossing the boulevard from the east when a 65-year-old woman driving north in a 2008 Ford Edge hit him.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>Gothamist</a></p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not an accident.

Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031. The move targets driver speed, a key factor in crash severity, and signals a shift toward automated enforcement on major city crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The officers 'lost control of their marked cruiser and slammed into the front of a Mexican restaurant' after swerving to avoid a car making a U-turn. Both officers sustained minor injuries. Hours earlier in Manhattan, a Dodge Charger 'spinning out of control' struck a police officer, pinning him against his patrol vehicle. Witness Abi Aguirre described, 'He crashed into a sanitation car... then he's doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car.' Both the officer and the driver were hospitalized.

The rear vehicle, driven by a distracted driver speeding, struck the front vehicle’s center back end. A rear passenger suffered neck injuries and shock, restrained by a lap belt and harness.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred at 12:36 a.m. on Arden Ave involving two SUVs traveling south. The front vehicle was stopped in traffic when the rear vehicle, driven by a licensed female driver, struck it at the center back end. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors for the rear driver. A 46-year-old female rear passenger in the front vehicle was injured, suffering neck injuries consistent with whiplash and experiencing shock. She was restrained by a lap belt and harness and was not ejected. The collision caused center front end damage to the rear vehicle and center back end damage to the front vehicle. The police report highlights driver errors—distraction and unsafe speed—as the cause, with no contributing factors attributed to the passenger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
