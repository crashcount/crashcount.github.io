Fifty injured. Two left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> This is Arden Heights-Rossville since 2022. These numbers are not just statistics. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at dawn and the empty seat at a table.</p><p><strong>Crashes do not slow down.</strong> In the last twelve months, there were 108 crashes. One person died. Fifty were hurt. Children were not spared—seven under eighteen were injured. The old were not spared—three over seventy-five were hurt. The road does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians bleed most.</strong> A 69-year-old woman, crossing at Yucca Drive and Dogwood Drive, was struck by an SUV making a left turn. Severe bleeding. A 20-year-old woman, not at an intersection, was hit by a sedan. Severe lacerations. These are not rare stories. They are routine. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and sedans caused most pedestrian injuries. Trucks and motorcycles are not far behind. Bikes caused none. The danger is heavy, fast, and steel.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Sammy’s Law passed. The city can set 20 mph limits. But the limit in Arden Heights-Rossville is not yet 20. The city has built more protected bike lanes and redesigned intersections elsewhere. But here, the pace is slow. The silence is loud.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras save lives.</strong> But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Each year, Albany must act or the cameras go dark. Each year, the risk returns.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act—or do not. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras.

The study, led by HDR, will look at expanding the bridge’s narrow lanes to meet federal standards and possibly adding more lanes. The matter summary states the goal is to 'relieve congestion and improve traffic flow.' State Senator Andrew Lanza pushed for the study, calling the bridge 'very narrow therefore very dangerous.' Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton acknowledged induced demand and said the study will consider all options, including a shared-use path for cyclists and pedestrians. Former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz opposed widening, urging investment in public transit instead. The study’s outcome could shape the future safety of vulnerable road users crossing between Staten Island and New Jersey.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The system failed to shift blame from drivers.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0758-2022 was introduced in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on October 12, 2022. The bill aimed to require every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter, and other legal motorized vehicle to be registered with the Department of Transportation and display a visible license plate. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.' Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections. The streets stayed dangerous. The cars kept their edge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
