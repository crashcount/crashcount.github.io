Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19. Enrique Martinez, 21. Police say a 21‑year‑old in a 2019 Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck the riders. Both were thrown and died. Prosecutors charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. “He had a strong odor of alcohol,” a complaint says. He refused a chemical test. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist reported it</a>. A sister stood outside court and said, “Two people were killed.

The southbound lanes closed. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/2-killed-1-taken-into-custody-in-multivehicle-bronx-river-parkway-crash-nypd-says>Police said</a> both riders were ejected. The numbers for this neighborhood say nights are brutal: injuries spike around midnight, 1 a.m., and again late evening. In the last three years here, the hours around 12 a.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m. carry the worst death counts. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data show it</a>.</p><p>This is Williamsbridge–Olinville. Since 2022, ten people are dead. Six were walking. One was on a bike. Three were inside cars. Parkways and wide roads come up again and again. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bronx River Parkway</a> shows two deaths and 126 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>White Plains Road</a> shows two deaths and 27 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bronxwood Avenue</a> shows three deaths.</p><p>On East 229th at Bronxwood, a 64‑year‑old man crossed with the signal. A left‑turning flatbed truck hit him and killed him. The factor on the report reads: failure to yield. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The record is here</a>. On East 233rd at Webster, a 24‑year‑old bicyclist was crushed between a sedan and an SUV. He died in the road. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>That report is here</a>.</p><p>Street by street, the city ledger fills with blunt causes: failure to yield. Inattention. Aggressive driving. A bucket labeled “other” covers most of the deaths. Pedestrians take the worst of it: six dead, 178 hurt. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The neighborhood roll‑up shows this</a>.</p><h3 id=nights-are-long-sirens-carry>Nights are long; sirens carry</h3><p>The midnight hour in this map bleeds. Two deaths, 40 injuries around 12 a.m. Another death at 9 p.m. Two more at 10 p.m. The after‑work rush hurts too: injuries stack up from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The hourly breakdown shows the peaks</a>.</p><p>Parkways encourage speed.

Eleven injuries at E 216th, including four serious. Three deaths tied to Bronxwood. The patterns point to turning cars and blocked sightlines. Failure to yield is named in fatal files. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the crash records</a>.</p><p>Fixes are not mysteries. Daylight the corners. Give walkers a few seconds head start at lights. Harden left turns so trucks must take them slow. Calming Bronxwood and White Plains with less width and lower speeds would save lives. Target nights.
