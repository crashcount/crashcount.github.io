Lawmakers in Albany have a bill to stop them. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force repeat violators to install speed‑limiters after a pattern of tickets or points. Senator Jamaal Bailey voted yes in committee. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>The bill file is here</a>. The Senate moved it on June 11 and 12. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Vote records show the yes votes</a>.</p><p>Speed itself is policy. New York now has the power to set lower limits, block by block or citywide. Advocates say use it. A 20 mph default would blunt the edge of crashes like the ones on Bronxwood and White Plains. The law to allow this passed after years of delay. The choice to act sits at City Hall.</p><p>The sister’s question still hangs in the air at the Bronx courthouse steps. “Two people were killed.

The MTA’s $68-billion plan faces a $33-billion gap. State leaders stalled, leaving riders and infrastructure in limbo. Advocates demand reliable, timely funding.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2025, MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber addressed state legislators, pressing for stable, recurring state funding for the MTA’s 2025-2029 capital plan. The $68-billion plan, approved by the MTA Board, has only $35 billion secured. State leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, rejected the plan’s funding gap, insisting it be resolved in the state budget. Lieber argued, 'the MTA capital budget is totally predictable... no different than Medicaid and education.' He called for the state to treat transit infrastructure as a core, recurring expense. Advocates like Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany echoed this, demanding the state guarantee timely payments and accountability. Governor Hochul and legislative leaders voiced support but offered no concrete solutions. The debate leaves the city’s transit riders waiting for action and exposes them to the risks of delayed repairs and unreliable service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hochul’s budget proposes $3 billion each from the state and city, less than the $4 billion the MTA expected. Hochul stated, "The MTA is developing an updated capital plan to propose to me and the legislature, and once we receive it, we will determine the best way to fund it." Advocates, including Reinvent Albany, called this an abdication of responsibility, warning it puts millions of transit riders at risk.

The lawmakers, joined by Senators Steven Rhoads and Bill Weber, criticized Lieber for 'losing the trust of commuters' and downplaying subway crime. They condemned the new $9 congestion pricing toll for Midtown, with Weber calling it 'tone deaf' and demanding repeal. The event summary reads: 'GOP pols push MTA boss to resign after brushing off transit crime as New York braces for even more taxes, fees.' The lawmakers oppose further taxes and fees to close the MTA’s $33 billion gap. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, district 35, formally objected to the unfunded capital plan with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. Their joint letter blocked the plan’s January 1 start, forcing negotiations. Governor Hochul, who backs the $68 billion plan, promised no income tax hikes but left other taxes and fees on the table.

Hochul is the face of the MTA’s congestion-toll madness: Don’t let her fool you,' blasted the $9 toll and warned that the agency’s legal power to raise prices remains. Stewart-Cousins and Heastie’s last-minute action signals deeper political games, not reform. The article quotes Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli: 'Consolidation, efficiency, and savings in this area was promised years ago, but has yet to be fully realized.' No safety analyst weighed in, but the capital plan’s collapse means no new investment in safer streets or transit. Vulnerable road users remain at risk.
