She did not make it. The SUV hit her at E. 216th Street. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. There were no charges. The street was quiet again, but a family was not. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a Bronx SUV driver, police said Sunday.</a></p><p>She was not alone. In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> on these streets. <strong>195 more were hurt. Seven were left with serious injuries.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none were spared. The numbers do not stop. They do not care.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-death-by-car-death-by-truck>The Pattern: Death by Car, Death by Truck</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed two. Trucks killed one. A bike, another.</strong> Cars and trucks did most of the hurting—<strong>39 injuries and 2 deaths</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds left two more bleeding. A single bike crash took a life. The machines are heavy. The bodies are not.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They count the dead. They promise to do better. They pass laws with names—Sammy’s Law, speed cameras, lower limits. But the streets in Williamsbridge-Olinville stay wide, fast, and deadly. Cameras and laws mean nothing if the speed does not drop, if the crossings do not change, if the drivers do not slow.</p><p><strong>No local leader has stood in the crosswalk and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</strong> No council member has called for a redesign of White Plains Road. No one has demanded the city use its new power to lower the speed to 20 mph here. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand cameras that never sleep. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

It also mandated the DOT to publish this information online, searchable by street. Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor, District 44) and Kevin C. Riley (co-sponsor, District 12) led the effort. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without passage. No safety analyst reviewed its impact on vulnerable road users.
