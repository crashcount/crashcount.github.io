She did not make it. The SUV hit her at E. 216th Street. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. There were no charges. The street was quiet again, but a family was not. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a Bronx SUV driver, police said Sunday.</a></p><p>She was not alone.

Seven were left with serious injuries.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none were spared. The numbers do not stop. They do not care.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-death-by-car-death-by-truck>The Pattern: Death by Car, Death by Truck</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed two. Trucks killed one. A bike, another.</strong> Cars and trucks did most of the hurting—<strong>39 injuries and 2 deaths</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds left two more bleeding. A single bike crash took a life. The machines are heavy. The bodies are not.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They count the dead. They promise to do better. They pass laws with names—Sammy’s Law, speed cameras, lower limits. But the streets in Williamsbridge-Olinville stay wide, fast, and deadly. Cameras and laws mean nothing if the speed does not drop, if the crossings do not change, if the drivers do not slow.</p><p><strong>No local leader has stood in the crosswalk and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</strong> No council member has called for a redesign of White Plains Road. No one has demanded the city use its new power to lower the speed to 20 mph here. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand cameras that never sleep.
