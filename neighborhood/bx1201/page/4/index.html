They promise to do better. They pass laws with names—Sammy’s Law, speed cameras, lower limits. But the streets in Williamsbridge-Olinville stay wide, fast, and deadly. Cameras and laws mean nothing if the speed does not drop, if the crossings do not change, if the drivers do not slow.</p><p><strong>No local leader has stood in the crosswalk and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</strong> No council member has called for a redesign of White Plains Road.

The action came via a Christmas Eve letter to MTA CEO Janno Leiber, rejecting the plan and stalling critical transit improvements. The plan, as described, funds 'essential work'—new trains, accessibility, power, and station repairs. Riders Alliance called on Albany to 'fix the subway.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance warned, 'the least-visible projects are the most vulnerable to cuts – but also often the most essential, like new signals and upgrades to power systems and structures.' Neither Heastie nor Stewart-Cousins responded to requests for comment. The rejection delays contract awards for new electric rail cars and locomotives, leaving millions of riders—and vulnerable road users—at risk from crumbling infrastructure and unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, reviewed by the Capital Plan Review Board, aimed to restore and upgrade New York’s aging mass transit. Stewart-Cousins and Carl Heastie cited a $33 billion funding gap, stating, 'The proposed program currently faces a significant funding deficit... which is a specific concern that needs to be addressed before we can approve the program.' The rejection halts contracts for new train cars and electrical upgrades. The MTA now has ten days to respond. This move follows delays from Governor Hochul’s congestion pricing pause.

Slick pavement, harsh lights. His body broken, the bike destroyed. Three vehicles kept moving. He did not.</p><p class=mb3>A 24-year-old man riding an e-bike was killed on Webster Avenue near East 233rd Street in the Bronx. According to the police report, the crash occurred when the e-bike rider was struck and crushed beneath two southbound vehicles—a 2018 Audi sedan and a 2023 Honda SUV. The report describes the pavement as 'slippery' and the lighting as 'harsh.' The police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, as well as the hazardous road surface. The e-bike was demolished, and the cyclist suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. The police report notes that all involved vehicles were traveling straight ahead at the time of the crash. No contributing factors are attributed to the victim. The report underscores the lethal consequences of driver inattention and dangerous road conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The Zoning Subcommittee, chaired by Council Member Kevin Riley, exempted single-family districts from new transit-oriented development rules. The matter summary reads: 'Urban Banning: Single-Family Districts Exempted from Transit-Oriented Development.' Council Members David Carr and Kamillah Hanks of Staten Island voted against the modified plan, defending suburban-style zoning. Riley argued, 'One-family zoned districts represent less than 15 percent of the city's land area... they are valuable.' The exemption means fewer apartments near transit, locking in car dependence. Moses Gates of the Regional Plan Association called the move senseless from a planning perspective. Lawmakers in affected neighborhoods hailed the change, but advocates warn it blocks safer, less car-centric housing near transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Crystal Hudson voted yes, urging all neighborhoods to share the housing burden. Council Member Kevin Riley defended single-family zones.

The impact occurred between a 2018 Dodge SUV traveling east and a 2016 Ford SUV traveling south. The driver of the Dodge SUV, a 39-year-old male occupant, was injured with an abrasion to his elbow and lower arm but remained conscious and was wearing a lap belt and harness. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'View Obstructed/Limited' as contributing factors to the crash. The Dodge driver’s limited view likely played a role in the collision, which involved impact to the right front bumper and right front quarter panel of the vehicles. No pedestrian or cyclist was involved, and no victim behaviors were noted as contributing factors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Hochul may slash the $68.4-billion MTA capital plan. Transit advocates rage. Riders face crumbling subways, broken promises. The governor holds the knife. The future of safe, reliable transit hangs in the balance. The buck stops with her.</p><p class=mb3>On September 30, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul announced she might not fill a $33-billion gap in the proposed 2025-2029 MTA capital plan, threatening to shrink the $68.4-billion package approved by the MTA Board. The plan now awaits review by the Capital Plan Review Board, which has 90 days to approve or reject it. The matter centers on whether the governor will force cuts to desperately needed repairs and upgrades. Advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance demand Hochul fund 'the reliable, accessible, resilient service we've long been denied but that we need and deserve.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls out Hochul’s record, urging her to cut her own Interborough Express project first if reductions come. The MTA declined comment. The fate of New York’s transit—and the safety of millions who rely on it—rests on this decision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Diana I. Ayala is the primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors including De La Rosa, Banks, Ossé, Marte, and others. The bill was laid over by committee on February 10, 2025. The measure would take effect immediately if passed. By capping required coverage, the bill may leave crash victims with less compensation after collisions involving TLC-licensed vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
