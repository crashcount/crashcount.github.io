Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19. Enrique Martinez, 21. Police say a 21‑year‑old in a 2019 Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck the riders. Both were thrown and died. Prosecutors charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. “He had a strong odor of alcohol,” a complaint says. He refused a chemical test. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist reported it</a>. A sister stood outside court and said, “Two people were killed. He was drunk.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>The Daily News had her words</a>.</p><p>It happened near Gun Hill Road in the dark hour after midnight. The southbound lanes closed. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/2-killed-1-taken-into-custody-in-multivehicle-bronx-river-parkway-crash-nypd-says>Police said</a> both riders were ejected. The numbers for this neighborhood say nights are brutal: injuries spike around midnight, 1 a.m., and again late evening. In the last three years here, the hours around 12 a.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m. carry the worst death counts. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data show it</a>.</p><p>This is Williamsbridge–Olinville. Since 2022, ten people are dead. Six were walking. One was on a bike. Three were inside cars. Parkways and wide roads come up again and again. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bronx River Parkway</a> shows two deaths and 126 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>White Plains Road</a> shows two deaths and 27 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bronxwood Avenue</a> shows three deaths.</p><p>On East 229th at Bronxwood, a 64‑year‑old man crossed with the signal. A left‑turning flatbed truck hit him and killed him. The factor on the report reads: failure to yield. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The record is here</a>. On East 233rd at Webster, a 24‑year‑old bicyclist was crushed between a sedan and an SUV. He died in the road. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>That report is here</a>.</p><p>Street by street, the city ledger fills with blunt causes: failure to yield. Inattention. Aggressive driving. A bucket labeled “other” covers most of the deaths. Pedestrians take the worst of it: six dead, 178 hurt. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The neighborhood roll‑up shows this</a>.</p><h3 id=nights-are-long-sirens-carry>Nights are long; sirens carry</h3><p>The midnight hour in this map bleeds. Two deaths, 40 injuries around 12 a.m. Another death at 9 p.m. Two more at 10 p.m. The after‑work rush hurts too: injuries stack up from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The hourly breakdown shows the peaks</a>.</p><p>Parkways encourage speed.

People outside cars lose.</p><h3 id=corners-that-dont-forgive>Corners that don’t forgive</h3><p>Two places top the danger list here: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>E 216th Street</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bronxwood Avenue</a>. Eleven injuries at E 216th, including four serious. Three deaths tied to Bronxwood. The patterns point to turning cars and blocked sightlines. Failure to yield is named in fatal files. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the crash records</a>.</p><p>Fixes are not mysteries. Daylight the corners. Give walkers a few seconds head start at lights. Harden left turns so trucks must take them slow. Calming Bronxwood and White Plains with less width and lower speeds would save lives. Target nights. The city’s own intervention notes say it: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>nighttime conditions</a> and repeat hotspots.</p><h3 id=the-worst-drivers-keep-finding-us>The worst drivers keep finding us</h3><p>A small slice of drivers do outsized harm. Lawmakers in Albany have a bill to stop them. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force repeat violators to install speed‑limiters after a pattern of tickets or points. Senator Jamaal Bailey voted yes in committee. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>The bill file is here</a>. The Senate moved it on June 11 and 12. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Vote records show the yes votes</a>.</p><p>Speed itself is policy. New York now has the power to set lower limits, block by block or citywide. Advocates say use it. A 20 mph default would blunt the edge of crashes like the ones on Bronxwood and White Plains. The law to allow this passed after years of delay. The choice to act sits at City Hall.</p><p>The sister’s question still hangs in the air at the Bronx courthouse steps. “Two people were killed. He was drunk.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Her quote lives here</a>. The rest is on the city to answer.</p><h3 id=what-can-end-the-pattern>What can end the pattern</h3><ul><li>Daylight and protected crossings at Bronxwood, White Plains, and E 216th.

No new transit money. No tougher penalties. Riders left waiting. Drivers keep blocking. The city’s slowest buses stay slow. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 15, 2022, the New York State Assembly and Senate released one-house budget proposals. Both left out Governor Hochul’s measures to increase fines for blocking bus lanes, raise penalties for toll evasion and defaced plates, and boost transit funding. The matter: 'State legislators used their budget proposals to prioritize drivers blocking bus lanes and evading tolls, omitting Gov. Hochul's proposals to raise fines for blocking bus lanes and increase penalties for toll evasion and defaced license plates.' Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie defended stripping policy from the budget. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein slammed the move: 'No increase in subway or bus service for millions of riders, no enhanced enforcement in the city with the slowest buses in the country.' The Senate promised to revisit bus lane enforcement later. Advocates doubted action would follow. The legislature’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed, with no relief from blocked bus lanes or reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
