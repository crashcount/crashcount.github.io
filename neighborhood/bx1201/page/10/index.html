A bike, another.</strong> Cars and trucks did most of the hurting—<strong>39 injuries and 2 deaths</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds left two more bleeding. A single bike crash took a life. The machines are heavy. The bodies are not.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They count the dead. They promise to do better. They pass laws with names—Sammy’s Law, speed cameras, lower limits. But the streets in Williamsbridge-Olinville stay wide, fast, and deadly. Cameras and laws mean nothing if the speed does not drop, if the crossings do not change, if the drivers do not slow.</p><p><strong>No local leader has stood in the crosswalk and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</strong> No council member has called for a redesign of White Plains Road. No one has demanded the city use its new power to lower the speed to 20 mph here. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand cameras that never sleep. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The program, part of the state budget, begins September 24 and will last six to twelve months. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, representing District 83, highlighted the benefit to thousands who rely on buses for work, school, and medical needs. The pilot waives fares to expand access and improve transit equity, as stated: 'By establishing these fare-free bus pilot routes, we are expanding access to public transportation across the city and improving transit equity to better serve all New Yorkers.' Advocates wanted all buses free, but the plan was scaled back in budget talks. The MTA will review impacts on ridership, service, and costs after six months.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The official statement read, 'Every community is different, and some members have significant concerns with moving forward with Sammy's Law at this time.'

Pedestrians pay.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill 'Sammy’s Law' remains stalled in the New York State Assembly. Speaker Carl Heastie (District 83) has not called a floor vote as of June 9, 2023, despite the bill passing the State Senate. The bill, championed by advocates, would let New York City set 20-mile-per-hour speed limits on some streets. The matter summary states, 'Heastie has not called a floor vote on Sammy’s Law, which would allow New York City to set a 20-mile-per-hour speed limit on some streets.' Heastie’s state vehicle was caught speeding 12 times in school zones. He claims staffers were driving. Transportation Chair Bill Magnarelli suggested the bill’s fate might have changed if the City Council had acted sooner, a claim the Council disputes. Heastie’s spokesman said, 'He reminded them that the reason we passed the speed-camera legislation was to ensure the safety of students and the public, and that these violations are unacceptable.' No formal safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Gutierrez led the charge. Brooks-Powers joined. Streets scarred by crashes and deaths. Lower speeds mean fewer bodies broken. The city waits. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, debated by the NYC Council and State Legislature, seeks home rule for New York City to lower speed limits from 25 to 20 mph on dangerous streets. Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest. The council’s action centers the lives of pedestrians and cyclists, demanding the city act before more are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Invited by Assembly Member Carroll, they were barred as 'lobbyists.' Sammy's Law, which would let New York City set speed limits, remains stalled. Grief meets bureaucracy.</p><p class=mb3>On June 8, 2023, advocates staged a hunger strike in Albany to protest the Assembly's inaction on Sammy's Law. The bill would allow New York City to control its own speed limits. Despite support from Governor Hochul, Mayor Adams, the City Council, and the state Senate, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie has not brought the bill to a vote. The matter summary states: 'On day three of a hunger strike... two mothers, Amy Cohen and Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, who lost children to reckless drivers, were labeled as lobbyists and threatened with removal from the Capitol.' Assembly Member Bobby Carroll invited the mothers, but they were told to stay outside. Cohen said, 'It’s outrageous that we couldn't be recognized.' Mendieta-Cuapio called the hunger strike necessary. The protest highlights the personal cost of advocacy and the political barriers blocking action on street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
