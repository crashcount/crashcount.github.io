But the blood did not stop. In twelve months, 199 people were hurt in 363 crashes. Three were left with serious injuries. Children were among the wounded—twenty under eighteen, their lives changed by a driver’s mistake (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not rare. Since 2022, Ridgewood has seen 1,399 crashes. Two people died. Seven suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger>The Shape of Danger</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. They killed one person and left twenty-two with moderate or serious injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left their mark. No one is safe when the street is built for speed and steel.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. A 74-year-old man was killed crossing Myrtle Avenue. A 64-year-old woman was crushed at Fresh Pond Road and 68th Avenue. A 23-year-old cyclist was thrown and battered on Gates Avenue. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the work is slow. The streets do not wait (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The law now allows a 20 mph limit. Yet Ridgewood waits. Each day without action is a day someone else may not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents.

The project, first announced under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced delays after Mayor Eric Adams took office. The north outer roadway is now for cyclists, the south for pedestrians. State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, District 12, praised the completion, saying, 'After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [the city's Department of Transportation] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge.'

The system failed them again.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, during New York State’s $254-million budget negotiations, lawmakers rejected Governor Hochul’s proposed street safety measures. The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions. Peña faces manslaughter and other charges, with a possible 15-year sentence if convicted.

Scott Avenue becomes a pedestrian plaza. DOT aims to cut crashes and deaths. Advocates and officials back the plan. The site saw 39 crashes in four years. Change comes after a fatality.</p><p class=mb3>On April 28, 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a street redesign for Scott Avenue in Bushwick, Brooklyn, following a fatal crash that killed motorcyclist Philippe Haussmann last August. The plan, supported by Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez and Transportation Alternatives, bans cars on a short stretch between Flushing and Johnson Avenues and removes parking at several corners for better visibility—a process known as daylighting. DOT will also narrow Scott Avenue further south and build a concrete pedestrian peninsula at Troutman Street, banning right turns onto Scott. The intersection, described as a 'crash hotspot' with 39 incidents since 2020, will see expanded pedestrian space and improved safety. Gutierrez noted increased foot traffic and little negative feedback. DOT claims the redesign can reduce deaths and serious injuries by up to 45 percent for pedestrians. Advocates say the changes will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year.
