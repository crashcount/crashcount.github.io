But the blood did not stop. In twelve months, 199 people were hurt in 363 crashes. Three were left with serious injuries. Children were among the wounded—twenty under eighteen, their lives changed by a driver’s mistake (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not rare. Since 2022, Ridgewood has seen 1,399 crashes. Two people died. Seven suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger>The Shape of Danger</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. They killed one person and left twenty-two with moderate or serious injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left their mark. No one is safe when the street is built for speed and steel.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. A 74-year-old man was killed crossing Myrtle Avenue. A 64-year-old woman was crushed at Fresh Pond Road and 68th Avenue. A 23-year-old cyclist was thrown and battered on Gates Avenue. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the work is slow. The streets do not wait (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The law now allows a 20 mph limit. Yet Ridgewood waits. Each day without action is a day someone else may not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents.

Holden sponsored the measure, which was referred to committee the same day. The bill would make it illegal to use a car to hold a parking spot and would bar leaving a car in one spot for more than five days. The Department of Transportation must alert drivers and stakeholders to these new rules.

Brooks-Powers (District 31), chair of the City Council’s Transportation Committee, came under fire after media reports revealed her family car received 25 traffic tickets in 16 months, including 20 for speeding near schools. The controversy centers on officials’ personal compliance with traffic laws while publicly supporting measures like speed cameras and congestion pricing. Brooks-Powers, who has promoted speed cameras and legislation to reward reporting hit-and-run drivers, claims her husband was responsible for the violations and that she has not used the car in over a year. Councilman Robert Holden called her a 'hypocrite,' while safe streets advocate Adam White stressed, 'Public officials and their families need to abide by speed cameras and red lights... people’s lives are at risk.' The incident highlights the gap between public safety advocacy and personal conduct, raising questions about accountability and public trust.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their proposal seeks $45 million in this year’s budget to boost bus frequency, with another $45 million to triple free buses citywide. The lawmakers’ push follows a successful fare-free pilot, which Mamdani says increased ridership by over 20%. Gianaris admitted, 'It should have been done sooner.' Critics argue the move is too late, as congestion pricing was approved in 2019. Some unions warn of possible driver shortages, but Mamdani insists existing buses and operators can handle the expansion. The funding proposal comes as the congestion toll faces lawsuits and could launch by mid-June.
