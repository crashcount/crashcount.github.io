The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.

The bill, led by Andrea Stewart-Cousins and mentioned in the Assembly and Senate one-house budgets, calls for $90 million to increase bus frequency and expand the MTA's free bus pilot. The matter summary states: 'State lawmakers proposed spending $90 million this year to improve bus service frequency and expand the scope of the MTA's free bus pilot.' The proposal, supported by Sen. Michael Gianaris and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, also adopts the FARES Act, extending half-price MetroCards to commuter rail, and funds new discounts for seniors and people with disabilities. Lawmakers back the QueensLink rail project and recommend subway improvements. They reject tougher toll enforcement, instead supporting the Toll Payer Protection Act.

They propose $90 million for frequent service and 15 new free routes. The plan targets gridlock and aims to boost ridership before congestion pricing hits. Riders in every borough stand to gain.</p><p class=mb3>Bill proposals in the New York State Assembly and Senate, introduced in February 2024 by State Sen. Michael Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, seek $90 million for increased bus service and 15 more free bus routes. These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The proposals now enter negotiations with Governor Hochul.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure promises $45 million for better bus reliability and frequency, targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities.

Introduced February 28, 2024, by Council Members Louis (primary), Carr, Ung, Holden, Ariola, Paladino, and Morano. The bill orders DOT to assess at least 100 speed camera locations each year for raised speed reducer feasibility. If feasible, DOT must install the bump within a year. The law demands annual reports on these checks and on shifts in dangerous driving at treated sites. The bill summary reads: 'requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' Council aims to force physical changes where cameras alone fail.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
