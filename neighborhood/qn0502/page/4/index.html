But the blood did not stop. In twelve months, 199 people were hurt in 363 crashes. Three were left with serious injuries. Children were among the wounded—twenty under eighteen, their lives changed by a driver’s mistake (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not rare. Since 2022, Ridgewood has seen 1,399 crashes. Two people died. Seven suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger>The Shape of Danger</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. They killed one person and left twenty-two with moderate or serious injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left their mark. No one is safe when the street is built for speed and steel.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. A 74-year-old man was killed crossing Myrtle Avenue. A 64-year-old woman was crushed at Fresh Pond Road and 68th Avenue. A 23-year-old cyclist was thrown and battered on Gates Avenue. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the work is slow. The streets do not wait (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The law now allows a 20 mph limit. Yet Ridgewood waits. Each day without action is a day someone else may not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by planners, by leaders who delay.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.

The MTA demanded $4 billion from the city—a 33% jump from the last plan—warning of major subway disruptions if denied. The matter, titled 'MTA threatens another ‘Summer of Hell’ of subway disruptions if NYC doesn’t cough up billions,' drew sharp words. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Queens) blasted the agency: 'Instead of insulting us with baseless threats, the agency that spends $30 million on a staircase should find ways to cut its wasteful spending and bloated payroll before asking for more taxpayer money.' Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility. Despite heated criticism, council members did not strongly oppose the request in session.

The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds.
