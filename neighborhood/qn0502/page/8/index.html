But the blood did not stop. In twelve months, 199 people were hurt in 363 crashes. Three were left with serious injuries. Children were among the wounded—twenty under eighteen, their lives changed by a driver’s mistake (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not rare. Since 2022, Ridgewood has seen 1,399 crashes. Two people died. Seven suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger>The Shape of Danger</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. They killed one person and left twenty-two with moderate or serious injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left their mark. No one is safe when the street is built for speed and steel.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. A 74-year-old man was killed crossing Myrtle Avenue. A 64-year-old woman was crushed at Fresh Pond Road and 68th Avenue. A 23-year-old cyclist was thrown and battered on Gates Avenue. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the work is slow. The streets do not wait (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The law now allows a 20 mph limit. Yet Ridgewood waits. Each day without action is a day someone else may not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents.

The article, published October 28, 2024, details community outrage after a cyclist’s death and repeated injuries. NYPD policy says chases should end when risk outweighs reward, but enforcement fails. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. Comptroller Brad Lander says, 'Drivers who are repeatedly caught by speed and red-light cameras currently face no consequences other than a fine in the mail. Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.' State Senator Michael Gianaris calls for stronger penalties, including suspending registrations. The NYPD has not adopted reforms. Residents and advocates demand legislative action and transparency. Without it, vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece, titled 'Eliminating ‘parking minimums’ in NYC can help ease the housing crisis,' argues that required parking spaces in new developments block affordable housing and favor cars over people. Bottcher writes, 'By eliminating parking minimums, we can unlock the potential for more housing units in buildings across the city.' He highlights that parking mandates raise construction costs, limit design, and disrupt street life. Bottcher’s call joins a national trend: cities like Minneapolis and Buffalo have already scrapped these rules. The op-ed claims that ending parking minimums will promote walking, cycling, and transit, making streets safer and more welcoming for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pause threatens subway and bus service. Advocates demand any replacement funds boost operations, not highways. Riders need frequent, affordable transit—not more gridlock and pollution.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published October 1, 2024, addresses Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing and seek alternative funding for the MTA’s $15-billion capital plan. The article states: “If the governor wants to do the MTA and riders a favor, she should use the money she finds to instead boost MTA operations.” Author Samuel Santaella criticizes Hochul’s move, arguing it jeopardizes service for working-class New Yorkers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris are cited as proponents of fare-free buses, while Riders Alliance pushes for six-minute service. The piece urges Hochul to reject highway expansions and instead invest in frequent, affordable transit. The editorial frames this as a fight for clean air, equity, and safety for all New Yorkers who rely on public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The tow truck was traveling west, going straight ahead, with no reported damage, while the bicycle suffered damage to its left rear quarter panel. The bicyclist was not wearing any safety equipment. The collision's point of impact was the left rear bumper of the bicycle and the right rear quarter panel of the tow truck.

The report lists "Driver Inattention/Distraction" as the contributing factor. Six women—drivers and passengers—were injured, all conscious, all suffering whiplash and full-body pain. All were restrained and none were ejected.

Jersey barriers will shield cyclists from highway traffic. Pedestrians and riders get a safer shot at Highland Park. The stretch has seen nearly 100 injuries in three years. Danger meets concrete.</p><p class=mb3>On August 23, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a project to install protected bike lanes and new sidewalks along Cypress Avenue, connecting to Ridgewood Reservoir. The plan, presented to Queens Community Board 5 in June, calls for a two-way cycle path protected by jersey barriers and sidewalk expansions between Cooper Avenue and Cypress Hills Street. The matter summary states: 'Protected bike lanes and built-out sidewalks are coming to Cypress Avenue to provide a safe connection to Highland Park.' Council Member Bob Holden, usually a cycling skeptic, supports the project. His spokesperson said, 'This particular lane benefits those biking to and from the Ridgewood Reservoir and addresses a broader quality of life issue along Cypress Avenue.' Advocates like Bree Mobley of Ridgewood Riders back the plan, citing the area's crash history—166 crashes, 99 injuries in three years. The project targets a corridor marked by high injury and death rates, aiming to shield vulnerable road users from relentless traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
