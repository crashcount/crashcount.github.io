The incident highlights ongoing failures in city safety policy. The intersection is described as 'very dangerous,' with fast turns and drivers not yielding. Only 27 percent of the city’s 5,860 heavy garbage trucks have side guards, despite a 2019 city deal requiring them by 2024. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, then a Council Member, said, 'side rails should be installed sooner.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives called for 'bold action' and criticized city officials for delaying redesigns and safety steps.

Advocacy groups, including Bike New York, are preparing testimony to stall the bill before it reaches the Senate floor or Assembly Cities Committee. Critics argue the DOT already must notify community boards under the 'Fidler rule,' and that this bill would gum up the process, delaying life-saving bike infrastructure.

The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver.

Hochul backs a new train line linking Queens and Brooklyn. The Interborough Express uses old tracks for new rapid transit. Borough presidents Richards and Reynoso support it. The plan faces cost, freight, and construction hurdles. Public review comes next.</p><p class=mb3>On January 21, 2022, Gov. Hochul announced the Interborough Express (IBX) project, a new train line connecting Bay Ridge in Brooklyn to Jackson Heights in Queens. The project is in early stages, with environmental review and public input ahead. The MTA’s feasibility study considered light rail, commuter rail, and bus rapid transit, aiming for a 45-minute end-to-end trip. The matter summary states: 'New York City is getting a new train line, the Interborough Express (IBX), thanks to Gov. Hochul's support for passenger service on the rail right of way connecting Queens and Brooklyn.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso voiced support at the announcement. The project uses existing right-of-way, avoiding eminent domain, but faces challenges with freight integration, track upgrades, and uncertain costs. Modular station designs aim to keep expenses down. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users has been published.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move aims to curb double parking and ease delivery chaos. The original plan was bigger, but politics cut it down. DOT faces pushback from drivers and boards. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. Passed by the City Council in late 2021, this law requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create at least 500 loading zones annually. The measure, authored by then-Council Member Antonio Reynoso, instructs DOT to use neighborhood density and public requests to guide placement. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, 'We’re expanding our loading zone program to meet the increasing demands of deliveries and cut down on unsafe double parking.' The original bill sought 25% of curb space for loading in dense areas, but the de Blasio administration opposed it. The final law was a compromise. DOT has struggled to site zones in residential neighborhoods due to driver and community board resistance. Transportation Alternatives backed the bill, calling current street use 'inequitable' and harmful to public health, safety, and city goals. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
