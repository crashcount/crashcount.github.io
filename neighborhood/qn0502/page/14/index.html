But the blood did not stop. In twelve months, 199 people were hurt in 363 crashes. Three were left with serious injuries. Children were among the wounded—twenty under eighteen, their lives changed by a driver’s mistake (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not rare. Since 2022, Ridgewood has seen 1,399 crashes. Two people died. Seven suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger>The Shape of Danger</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. They killed one person and left twenty-two with moderate or serious injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left their mark. No one is safe when the street is built for speed and steel.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. A 74-year-old man was killed crossing Myrtle Avenue. A 64-year-old woman was crushed at Fresh Pond Road and 68th Avenue. A 23-year-old cyclist was thrown and battered on Gates Avenue. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the work is slow. The streets do not wait (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The law now allows a 20 mph limit. Yet Ridgewood waits. Each day without action is a day someone else may not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents.

The bill, before the Transportation Committee, would require licensing and visible plates for all e-bikes, scooters, and legal motorized vehicles not already registered with the DMV. The board opposed the measure, passing a resolution 21-15 (with five abstentions), calling it 'overly broad and ineffective at addressing safety concerns.' The matter summary reads: 'Require registration and licensing for all e-bikes and legal motorized vehicles.' Board members Brian Van Nieuwenhoven and Jason Froimowitz criticized the bill as incomplete and unrealistic, noting it would not solve dangerous operation or enforcement issues. Holden dismissed the board’s opposition as unrepresentative.

The proposal, discussed on October 20, 2023, awaits state approval and has no active Albany bill yet. The measure, as described, would let sanitation staff review footage and issue tickets to cars blocking sweepers. The matter summary: 'New York's street sweepers should have cameras to ticket car owners who flout the city's alternate-side parking rules.' Holden said, 'Our goal is not to punish. Our goal is obviously to have cleaner streets.' The bill aims to clear blocked routes and improve sanitation. The proposal faces pushback from drivers but has support from city officials seeking cleaner, safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, backed by a council majority, aims to regulate e-bikes but, as the article notes, 'does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden’s action—pushing for licensing—was met with calls for wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes, and fairer delivery work standards instead. The piece warns that Holden’s approach would create a bureaucratic burden for riders while failing to protect pedestrians. It urges the council to focus on infrastructure, not over-policing or flat fines, and highlights the need for equitable, safe streets for all vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy.

The bill, now backed by a Council majority, would require all legal e-bikes and scooters to be registered and display license plates. The meeting opened with a standing ovation for Holden, but tensions rose when NYPD Deputy Inspector Erik Worobey praised deliveristas for safer riding. The crowd booed, voicing fear of fast e-vehicles. The E-VSA’s nine-point plan calls for reclassifying e-bikes as mopeds, ending a park e-bike pilot, and NYPD confiscation of e-vehicles on sidewalks, with a $500 retrieval fine. The group frames itself as victims of 'rogue' riders, though city statistics show drivers of larger vehicles cause far more injuries. The bill does not address mopeds or provide funding, and critics say it ignores the dangers faced by delivery workers, 26 of whom died between 2020 and 2022.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal.

One person vanished into a taxi. The streets outside Brooklyn Mirage stay dark and crowded. Concertgoers demand better lighting, safer taxis, and real security. Councilmember Gutiérrez calls for investment. The city and venue face pressure. Danger lingers in the shadows.</p><p class=mb3>On August 15, 2023, Councilmember Jennifer Gutiérrez (District 34) responded to public calls for safety improvements outside Brooklyn Mirage, an East Williamsburg concert venue. The matter, titled 'Concertgoers demand changes outside Brooklyn Mirage after recent deaths, kidnapping,' follows two deaths and a reported kidnapping near the venue. Gutiérrez acknowledged the need for 'more investment' and called for better lighting, signage, phone/data connectivity, and accessible public transportation. Patrons cited 'serious concerns regarding the safety of concert attendees,' accusing the venue of 'extreme negligence.' The area suffers from poor lighting and unreliable cell service, especially during crowded events. Gutiérrez and other officials support stronger security, a crackdown on unlicensed taxis, and improved infrastructure. The venue claims cooperation with authorities. The city faces mounting pressure to address systemic dangers for pedestrians and concertgoers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
