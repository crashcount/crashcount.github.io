But the blood did not stop. In twelve months, 199 people were hurt in 363 crashes. Three were left with serious injuries. Children were among the wounded—twenty under eighteen, their lives changed by a driver’s mistake (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not rare. Since 2022, Ridgewood has seen 1,399 crashes. Two people died. Seven suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger>The Shape of Danger</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. They killed one person and left twenty-two with moderate or serious injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left their mark. No one is safe when the street is built for speed and steel.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. A 74-year-old man was killed crossing Myrtle Avenue. A 64-year-old woman was crushed at Fresh Pond Road and 68th Avenue. A 23-year-old cyclist was thrown and battered on Gates Avenue. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the work is slow. The streets do not wait (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The law now allows a 20 mph limit. Yet Ridgewood waits. Each day without action is a day someone else may not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents.

The matter, titled 'MTA plans fare hike as it OKs $1.27B train car purchase weeks before new congestion toll: ‘Keep the grift alive’,' drew fire from Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who called the fare and toll hikes a 'scam' and accused the MTA of mismanagement. Holden’s comments echo broader council criticism of the MTA’s spending and question the effectiveness of congestion pricing. MTA officials defend the investment, citing improved reliability and safety with the new R211 cars. No independent safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the measure, stating, 'The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal [cycling] behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.' Rodriguez cited data: 105 pedestrians killed by cars this year, versus six by e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters combined. He argued that street redesigns, not new bureaucracy, cut deaths and injuries. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams echoed this, noting that registration backers often resist proven safety fixes like protected bike lanes. Rodriguez warned the bill would waste $19 million and slow adoption of sustainable transport.

The committee reviewed the proposal, which aims to regulate these vehicles and address their growing presence. The bill summary states: 'A bill requiring electric bikes, scooters, and other motorized vehicles to have license plates and be registered.' Holden, who sponsored the bill, argued it would help identify riders and discourage hit-and-runs. Critics countered that the measure diverts attention from drivers, who cause most injuries and deaths. Danny Harris, former Transportation Alternatives director, called for a holistic safety approach, including holding delivery apps accountable. The hearing also addressed battery fire risks, with 250 lithium-ion battery fires reported this year. The debate centers on whether registration improves safety for vulnerable road users or simply shifts blame.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary calls this a 'common sense way to address concerns about e-bike rider behavior.' Holden leads the charge, but critics, including Shabazz Stuart, call the bill 'flawed, impossible to enforce, unnecessary, and regressive.' They warn it will hit low-income and minority communities hardest, discourage e-bike use, and fail to improve safety. Stuart notes, 'Registration mandates are notoriously difficult to enforce at almost every level of government.' He argues that real safety comes from proven measures: protected bike lanes, road diets, and consistent enforcement of existing laws.

Bureaucracy grows, safety gains vanish.</p><p class=mb3>On December 10, 2024, the City Council held a hearing on a bill requiring the Department of Transportation to register all electric bikes, including pedal-assist Citi Bikes. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Robert Holden, claims to address e-bike rider behavior. The matter summary reads: 'require the city Department of Transportation to create a registration system, and a newly created license plate, for all electric bikes.' Shabazz Stuart, writing in Streetsblog NYC, calls the bill 'flawed, impossible to enforce, unnecessary, and will not work.' He warns it will be expensive, difficult to implement, and lead to selective policing, especially against poorer and minority communities. Stuart notes registration schemes have failed elsewhere and that police already have tools to address reckless cycling. He concludes the bill would not improve safety, but instead create bureaucracy and enforcement challenges, with no benefit for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law would require all e-mobility devices to be registered with the city’s Department of Transportation and carry license plates. Holden criticizes delivery apps and calls for companies to be held responsible for repeat offenders. He cites the 2023 death of Priscilla Loke as a catalyst.
