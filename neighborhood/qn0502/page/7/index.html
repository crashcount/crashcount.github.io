But the blood did not stop. In twelve months, 199 people were hurt in 363 crashes. Three were left with serious injuries. Children were among the wounded—twenty under eighteen, their lives changed by a driver’s mistake (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not rare. Since 2022, Ridgewood has seen 1,399 crashes. Two people died. Seven suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger>The Shape of Danger</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. They killed one person and left twenty-two with moderate or serious injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left their mark. No one is safe when the street is built for speed and steel.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. A 74-year-old man was killed crossing Myrtle Avenue. A 64-year-old woman was crushed at Fresh Pond Road and 68th Avenue. A 23-year-old cyclist was thrown and battered on Gates Avenue. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the work is slow. The streets do not wait (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The law now allows a 20 mph limit. Yet Ridgewood waits. Each day without action is a day someone else may not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by planners, by leaders who delay.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT, NYPD, and Finance join forces. One year to study, then report. Aim: expose the scale, recommend fixes. Vulnerable road users wait for action. Systemic risk remains unchecked.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 0765-2024 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after introduction on April 11, 2024. The bill, titled "A Local Law in relation to establishing a task force on vehicles registered out-of-state," calls for an interagency group—DOT, NYPD, Finance, plus mayoral and council appointees—to study the prevalence of out-of-state vehicle registrations in New York City. Sponsors include Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Robert F. Holden, Gale A. Brewer, Amanda Farías, James F. Gennaro, and Lincoln Restler. The task force has one year to investigate and report to the Mayor and Council Speaker. The bill aims to expose registration loopholes and recommend solutions, but for now, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—remain at risk as enforcement and accountability lag.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He warns the Upper West Side is turning into a commuter parking lot. Critics say the $15 toll will push traffic and pollution into outer neighborhoods. Residents and officials voice anger and frustration.</p><p class=mb3>On April 6, 2024, Councilman Robert F. Holden (District 30) criticized New York City’s congestion pricing plan, which will charge drivers $15 to enter below 60th Street. The matter, titled 'NYC’s Upper West Side already becoming commuter parking lot for congestion-pricing evaders,' highlights growing concern that the plan will shift traffic and pollution to neighborhoods like the Upper West Side, Kew Gardens, Staten Island, and Brooklyn. Holden said, 'You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out: if you are going to charge people $15 to go below 60th, those people will look for alternatives.' Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, a supporter, admitted, 'It’s going to get worse once there’s a charge at 60th Street—no doubt about it.' Councilwoman Lynn Shulman backs a residential permit parking pilot to address spillover. Community leaders say residents were not consulted. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, underscoring the moped driver's dangerous actions.

The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street.

The move targets long, complex trips that force riders to pay extra.

Introduced March 7, 2024, it urges Albany to pass and sign a law creating unlimited subway and bus transfers within two hours for pay-per-ride users. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation, which would create unlimited transfers within the two-hour period of paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority subway or bus fare for pay-per-ride users.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez leads as primary sponsor, joined by Riley, Stevens, Hanif, Won, Feliz, Salaam, Hanks, Farías, De La Rosa, Cabán, Williams, Hudson, Ung, Ossé, Banks, and Holden. The sponsors argue the current one-transfer rule hits hardest for riders with long, complex trips, often in transit deserts. They demand fare equity for all, not just those with short, easy rides.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders want speed, reliability, and access.</p><p class=mb3>Senator Michael Gianaris introduced the 'Congestion Pricing Done Right' bill on March 4, 2024. The bill, now before the legislature, seeks to expand New York City's fare-free bus pilot from five to fifteen lines, with three in each borough. The measure promises $45 million for better bus reliability and frequency, targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities. The bill summary states: 'expand and extend New York City's fare-free bus pilot program.' Gianaris, as sponsor, aims to boost mass transit before congestion pricing takes effect. Supporters, including Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Riders Alliance, and the Transport Workers Union, stress that affordable, frequent buses are vital for safety and equity. MTA Chair Janno Lieber backs more service but warns that bus lanes lag behind. The bill focuses on routes that can handle more buses without new infrastructure, aiming to make public transit a real alternative to cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
