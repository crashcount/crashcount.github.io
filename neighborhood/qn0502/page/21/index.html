But the blood did not stop. In twelve months, 199 people were hurt in 363 crashes. Three were left with serious injuries. Children were among the wounded—twenty under eighteen, their lives changed by a driver’s mistake (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not rare. Since 2022, Ridgewood has seen 1,399 crashes. Two people died. Seven suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger>The Shape of Danger</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. They killed one person and left twenty-two with moderate or serious injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left their mark. No one is safe when the street is built for speed and steel.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. A 74-year-old man was killed crossing Myrtle Avenue. A 64-year-old woman was crushed at Fresh Pond Road and 68th Avenue. A 23-year-old cyclist was thrown and battered on Gates Avenue. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the work is slow. The streets do not wait (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The law now allows a 20 mph limit. Yet Ridgewood waits. Each day without action is a day someone else may not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents.

Residents in District 40 and four other Brooklyn districts can vote on local projects. Ballots close April 10. The process funds parks, schools, and public spaces. The city lets people decide. Streets may change.</p><p class=mb3>Participatory Budgeting voting opened in Brooklyn District 40 on April 7, 2022. Councilmember Rita Joseph announced the cycle, which runs until April 10. The process lets residents as young as 11 vote on capital and expense projects. The official matter title: 'Voting for Participatory Budgeting is open in five Brooklyn districts until April 10.' Joseph, along with councilmembers Jennifer Gutiérrez (34), Chi Ossé (36), Alexa Avilés (38), and Shahana Hanif (39), offers in-person and online voting. Projects range from park upgrades to school improvements. Final results will be announced the week of April 17. Participatory Budgeting shapes how public money is spent, but the safety impact for vulnerable road users depends on which projects win. No direct safety assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
