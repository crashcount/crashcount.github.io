Five left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In Van Cortlandt Park, from 2022 to June 2025, the road has not forgiven. The names are not here. Only the numbers. But every number is a body, a family, a future cut short or bent out of shape. <strong>281 people injured in 385 crashes.</strong></p><p><strong>Pedestrians are not spared.</strong> A 64-year-old woman died walking along the Major Deegan Expressway. Two more pedestrians were struck—one at an intersection, one not. The cars kept going.

But in Van Cortlandt Park, the pace of change is slow. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No major redesigns.</strong> The numbers do not show progress. They show pain.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras work, but only where installed.</strong> The law that keeps them running is always under threat. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a name that could be lost.</p><h3 id=the-same-streets-the-same-danger>The Same Streets, The Same Danger</h3><p><strong>Most crashes involve cars and SUVs.</strong> The machines are heavy, fast, and everywhere. Motorcycles crash too. Bikes are not the problem. The problem is speed, steel, and inaction.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.</strong> It is policy. It is the choice to wait. It is the silence after the sirens fade.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits.

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement.

The bill, introduced January 8, 2025, in the New York State Assembly, is titled: "Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles." Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage. Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes. The measure signals strong legislative support for systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets will change.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0746-2024, now Local Law 94 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 12, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
