A 17-year-old, Juan Alexander Quizhpi Naranjo, drove a moped with a 14-year-old passenger when they collided with a Honda Odyssey. Both were thrown from the moped. Quizhpi Naranjo died at Jacobi Hospital; the girl survived. The minivan driver, 42, remained at the scene and faced no charges.

No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car."
