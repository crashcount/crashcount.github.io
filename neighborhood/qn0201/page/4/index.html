A man, 58, crossing Jackson Avenue, struck dead at the intersection. A 43-year-old e-bike rider, crushed by a bus at Queens Boulevard. A 30-year-old, thrown from his moped, left lifeless on 44 Drive. The numbers are cold, but the loss is not. Every crash leaves a hole—a family waiting for a voice that will not come home.</p><h2 id=broken-crossings-broken-promises>Broken Crossings, Broken Promises</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Intersections like Jackson Avenue and Queens Boulevard are killing fields. Pedestrians and cyclists are hit where the city should protect them most. The data shows the pattern: failure to yield, unsafe speed, distraction. The city knows these truths. Still, the bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Council Member Julie Won has backed real change.</strong> She helped secure funding for the Queens Boulevard redesign, which brought a 68% drop in deaths and a 35% fall in injuries since 2015. The redesign added protected bike lanes and pedestrian islands. &ldquo;Queens Boulevard is not the Boulevard of Death anymore, but the Boulevard of Life,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/dot-completion-of-queens-boulevard-redesign/>in November 2024</a>.</p><p>Won also voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She pushed for daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines. She stood with advocates for the Blissville Greenway, a bike lane where cyclists had died before, as reported by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/07/case-closed-judge-allows-dot-to-build-a-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. The crossings are still dangerous. The city moves slow. Too many bills sit in committee. Too many families wait for justice.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who delay, who settle for half-measures, who let drivers rule the road. Call your council member. Demand more protected lanes, more daylighting, more action. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment.

The measure seeks to remove bus fares for a year, aiming to make transit more accessible. No committee vote or further action has been recorded yet.

The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with key votes on February 13, 2025. The law, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring street resurfacing coordination,' requires the Department of Transportation to coordinate with agencies and utilities and finish resurfacing within 15 business days after milling. If DOT cannot meet the deadline, it must post a public notice and alert the community board. Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The measure responds to the hazard of prolonged, uneven streets, which put pedestrians, cyclists, and people with mobility devices at risk. The law’s timeline and notice rules take effect in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Senate and Assembly leaders have not chosen a revenue source. Carroll’s stance: 'increasing the congestion toll should come first.' Other options—taxing the rich, payroll tax hikes, vice taxes—face resistance. MTA Chair Janno Lieber urges focus on repairs, not expansion.
