Four left with injuries so grave they may never heal.</strong> In the last three years, the streets of Long Island City-Hunters Point have not forgiven a single mistake. A 58-year-old man, crossing at Jackson Avenue, died in the dark hours of April. A 43-year-old e-bike rider, crushed by a bus at Queens Boulevard. A 30-year-old, thrown from his moped, never stood up again. The numbers are small only if you do not know their names.</p><p><strong>In the past twelve months:</strong> 129 people injured, one left with life-altering wounds. No deaths, but the dice keep rolling. Most victims are young. Most are walking, riding, or crossing. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=the-machines-cars-trucks-and-the-cost-of-speed>The Machines: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost of Speed</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm.</strong> They killed once, left ten with moderate injuries, and one with injuries called “serious.” Trucks and buses struck too. Bikes and mopeds, unprotected, paid in blood. The street does not care who is right. It only takes.</p><h3 id=the-system-promises-delays-and-the-weight-of-silence>The System: Promises, Delays, and the Weight of Silence</h3><p><strong>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same.</strong> The city claims progress. They point to new laws, new cameras, new limits. But the blood dries on the concrete all the same. In April, a bolt from the No. 7 train crashed through a windshield at Queens Plaza. The driver, Rahimi, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/exclusive-debris-subway-tracks-shattered-mans-windshield-dented-car-queens/16217411/>said</a>, &ldquo;I thought we were being shot at at the time because the velocity of the metal it hit so hard that for a second I thought it was a bullet.&rdquo; The city promises to inspect. The city promises to fix. The city promises.</p><p><strong>Vision Zero. Sammy’s Law. Speed cameras.</strong> The words are big. The actions are slow.

Lives hang in the balance while cars keep their lanes.</p><p class=mb3>On May 23, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced at a City Council hearing that the dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge would be delayed until at least mid-2024. This is the fourth delay for the project, which was originally promised by the end of 2022. The matter, discussed in the Council, centers on transforming the south outer roadway from a car lane into a pedestrian path, giving cyclists sole access to the north outer roadway. Council Member Julie Won (D-Astoria) expressed frustration, stating, 'It was announced that it would be open in 2022 ... and last year you said that it may be 2024. You now have a delayed update again.' Won highlighted the life-and-death risk for vulnerable users forced to share a narrow, overcrowded path. DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione cited supply chain issues, especially with paint, as the reason for the delay, but refused to cede a car lane, citing traffic concerns. Advocacy group Bike New York's Jon Orcutt urged the city to test weekend closures for cars. The delay keeps pedestrians and cyclists in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure raised the payroll mobility tax only for New York City businesses with high payrolls, exempting suburban firms after pushback from their legislators. The Fiscal Policy Institute found this move shifted the tax burden onto Black and Latino workers in the city. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani condemned the policy, saying, 'this illustrates the consequences of fiscal policy that privileges the suburbs over the larger MTA region.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll was one of the few to oppose the exemption. FPI’s Emily Eisner noted, 'there will be a 25-percent decline in the share of white workers impacted by the tax, and a 36-percent increase in the share of Black workers impacted.' Governor Hochul defended the plan as necessary to save the MTA. The bill’s racial and geographic inequity remains stark.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, backed by Governor Hochul and legislative leaders, broadens enforcement to drivers blocking bus stops, truck loading zones, bike lanes, intersections, and crosswalks. Fines start at $50, escalating for repeat offenses. The MTA will increase buses with cameras from 450 to 1,000 by year's end. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and advocate Sara Lind support the move, calling it vital for bus reliability and street safety. Lind says, 'Camera-based enforcement is such a powerful tool for making our streets safer.' The budget also addresses MTA funding, but some, like Mamdani, criticize the city's increased financial burden.

The pilot aims to increase bus ridership and keep fares low, while new funding measures—like a payroll mobility tax and increased city contributions—shore up the MTA’s finances.

The site has seen 103 crashes and 47 injuries since 2020. Council Member Julie Won responded, calling the fatality 'another senseless death that could have been prevented with traffic calming measures and street redesigns.' Won urged the Department of Transportation to 'take immediate action to redesign this intersection to prevent further injuries and death.' The council member’s statement highlights the urgent need for safer streets for all users—pedestrians, cyclists, and moped riders. The intersection’s deadly record underscores systemic failure. Won’s demand: redesign now, before more lives are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan is part of the 'Fix the MTA' package, originally championed by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and progressive allies. Adams said, 'I strongly support the thought of having 10 buses being free on lines in the city. I think it would make a major impact.' Mamdani called free buses 'transformative' for working-class New Yorkers. Despite this, other bus improvements lag. Adams pledged 150 miles of new bus lanes in four years, but only 11.95 miles were built last year. Some projects stalled amid political opposition. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber stressed the need for city commitment to bus lanes and warned of fare hikes and service cuts if funding gaps persist.

The proposal, championed by Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani and supported by Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, is tangled in state budget negotiations. The Assembly and Senate included the pilot in their responses to Governor Hochul’s executive budget, but the governor’s plan left it out. The pilot would select two routes per borough, one serving a low-income area and one a commercial corridor. 'I strongly support the thought of having ten buses being free. The lines in the city I think will make a major impact,' Adams said. Mamdani called free buses 'a huge win for working-class NYers.' The plan’s fate remains uncertain as Albany’s budget talks drag on. Advocates note the mayor’s slow progress on promised bus lanes, leaving riders with sluggish service even as fare relief is debated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
