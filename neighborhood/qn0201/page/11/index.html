A man, 58, crossing Jackson Avenue, struck dead at the intersection. A 43-year-old e-bike rider, crushed by a bus at Queens Boulevard. A 30-year-old, thrown from his moped, left lifeless on 44 Drive. The numbers are cold, but the loss is not. Every crash leaves a hole—a family waiting for a voice that will not come home.</p><h2 id=broken-crossings-broken-promises>Broken Crossings, Broken Promises</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Intersections like Jackson Avenue and Queens Boulevard are killing fields. Pedestrians and cyclists are hit where the city should protect them most. The data shows the pattern: failure to yield, unsafe speed, distraction. The city knows these truths. Still, the bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Council Member Julie Won has backed real change.</strong> She helped secure funding for the Queens Boulevard redesign, which brought a 68% drop in deaths and a 35% fall in injuries since 2015. The redesign added protected bike lanes and pedestrian islands. &ldquo;Queens Boulevard is not the Boulevard of Death anymore, but the Boulevard of Life,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/dot-completion-of-queens-boulevard-redesign/>in November 2024</a>.</p><p>Won also voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She pushed for daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines. She stood with advocates for the Blissville Greenway, a bike lane where cyclists had died before, as reported by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/07/case-closed-judge-allows-dot-to-build-a-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. The crossings are still dangerous. The city moves slow. Too many bills sit in committee. Too many families wait for justice.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who delay, who settle for half-measures, who let drivers rule the road. Call your council member. Demand more protected lanes, more daylighting, more action. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps.

They warn free bridges funnel traffic into certain neighborhoods. Their letter calls for fairness. The MTA stays silent. The Traffic Mobility Review Board will decide. Streets hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On July 18, 2023, Council Member Shahana Hanif and other Brooklyn officials called for 'equalized tolling on all crossings into Manhattan' as congestion pricing nears. Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
