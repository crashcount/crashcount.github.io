Four left with injuries so grave they may never heal.</strong> In the last three years, the streets of Long Island City-Hunters Point have not forgiven a single mistake. A 58-year-old man, crossing at Jackson Avenue, died in the dark hours of April. A 43-year-old e-bike rider, crushed by a bus at Queens Boulevard. A 30-year-old, thrown from his moped, never stood up again. The numbers are small only if you do not know their names.</p><p><strong>In the past twelve months:</strong> 129 people injured, one left with life-altering wounds. No deaths, but the dice keep rolling. Most victims are young. Most are walking, riding, or crossing. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=the-machines-cars-trucks-and-the-cost-of-speed>The Machines: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost of Speed</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm.</strong> They killed once, left ten with moderate injuries, and one with injuries called “serious.” Trucks and buses struck too. Bikes and mopeds, unprotected, paid in blood. The street does not care who is right. It only takes.</p><h3 id=the-system-promises-delays-and-the-weight-of-silence>The System: Promises, Delays, and the Weight of Silence</h3><p><strong>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same.</strong> The city claims progress. They point to new laws, new cameras, new limits. But the blood dries on the concrete all the same. In April, a bolt from the No. 7 train crashed through a windshield at Queens Plaza. The driver, Rahimi, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/exclusive-debris-subway-tracks-shattered-mans-windshield-dented-car-queens/16217411/>said</a>, &ldquo;I thought we were being shot at at the time because the velocity of the metal it hit so hard that for a second I thought it was a bullet.&rdquo; The city promises to inspect. The city promises to fix. The city promises.</p><p><strong>Vision Zero. Sammy’s Law. Speed cameras.</strong> The words are big. The actions are slow.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>At a City Council oversight hearing on March 17, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) confirmed the Queensboro Bridge south outer roadway pedestrian path will not open until early 2024. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez blamed inaccurate timelines from the previous administration and ongoing upper deck reconstruction. Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton said, 'We feel very committed to turn that south outer roadway into the pedestrian path,' but insisted the deck work must finish first. Council Member Julie Won, voicing frustration, declared, 'It is unacceptable that DOT continues delaying the timeline.' She demanded the city stop prioritizing cars over pedestrians and open the path by the end of 2023 as promised. The delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed, with Won warning, 'Every delay means more serious injuries from traffic violence.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing, part of the state budget process, saw Lieber defend Governor Hochul’s proposed 5.5-percent fare increase as a return to regular hikes paused during the pandemic. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and colleagues pushed the 'Fix the MTA' package to freeze fares, boost service, and make buses free. Mamdani argued, 'It is simply not acceptable to put the cost of a basic public good on the backs of working class New Yorkers.' Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris criticized Lieber for insisting on fare hikes while dismissing other budget solutions. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas opposed making her constituents pay more. Lieber expressed concern about free buses, preferring targeted affordability programs. The hearing highlighted a sharp divide: lawmakers want to protect riders; the MTA wants stable funding. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, saw Simon and other officials racing at Smith-9th Streets station to dramatize the daily struggle of straphangers. The matter focused on 'the impact of low MTA funding and long wait times.' Simon said, 'It is really critically important...for people to be able to take reliable, safe, regular, speedy-enough transit service. That’s what’s going to get people out of their cars.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymembers Robert Carroll and Zohran Mamdani also participated, urging Albany to boost state funding and implement congestion pricing. The lawmakers oppose fare hikes and the rider-funded model, calling for public dollars to improve frequency and reliability.

The matter: 'Advocates and legislators raced up the stairs...to press their case for Gov. Hochul to do more to fill the MTA's fiscal gap.' Hochul’s plan stabilizes finances but does not boost service or halt fare hikes. Mamdani and Gounardes called for six-minute off-peak trains and new taxes on the wealthy.

Its matter title reads: 'Requires the consideration of complete street design for certain transportation projects which receive federal or state funding.' Didi Barrett leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Amy Paulin, Carrie Woerner, and many others as co-sponsors. The bill compels agencies to consider complete street design—meaning streets built for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users, not just drivers. It also requires the department to publish guidance and reference materials for public use. This measure, if enforced, could reshape how New York builds and rebuilds its roads, putting vulnerable road users at the center of every project.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
