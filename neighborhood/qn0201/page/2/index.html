Four left with injuries so grave they may never heal.</strong> In the last three years, the streets of Long Island City-Hunters Point have not forgiven a single mistake. A 58-year-old man, crossing at Jackson Avenue, died in the dark hours of April. A 43-year-old e-bike rider, crushed by a bus at Queens Boulevard. A 30-year-old, thrown from his moped, never stood up again. The numbers are small only if you do not know their names.</p><p><strong>In the past twelve months:</strong> 129 people injured, one left with life-altering wounds. No deaths, but the dice keep rolling. Most victims are young. Most are walking, riding, or crossing. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=the-machines-cars-trucks-and-the-cost-of-speed>The Machines: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost of Speed</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm.</strong> They killed once, left ten with moderate injuries, and one with injuries called “serious.” Trucks and buses struck too. Bikes and mopeds, unprotected, paid in blood. The street does not care who is right. It only takes.</p><h3 id=the-system-promises-delays-and-the-weight-of-silence>The System: Promises, Delays, and the Weight of Silence</h3><p><strong>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same.</strong> The city claims progress. They point to new laws, new cameras, new limits. But the blood dries on the concrete all the same. In April, a bolt from the No. 7 train crashed through a windshield at Queens Plaza. The driver, Rahimi, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/exclusive-debris-subway-tracks-shattered-mans-windshield-dented-car-queens/16217411/>said</a>, &ldquo;I thought we were being shot at at the time because the velocity of the metal it hit so hard that for a second I thought it was a bullet.&rdquo; The city promises to inspect. The city promises to fix. The city promises.</p><p><strong>Vision Zero. Sammy’s Law. Speed cameras.</strong> The words are big. The actions are slow. The deaths are real.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-than-words>What Now: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the DOT.</strong> Tell them you want streets that do not kill. Tell them you want action, not another press release. Tell them you will not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city’s most vulnerable pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>Mayoral Question 2, posed to 2025 candidates, asks how they will address New York City’s slow bus system. The candidates—Brad Lander, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, Whitney Tilson, Zellnor Myrie, and Zohran Mamdani—support more dedicated bus lanes, stronger enforcement, and faster boarding. Scott Stringer calls for 'dedicated bus lanes, more enforcement, more shelters, better curbs, more transit signal priority, all-door boarding, and more frequent off-peak services.' Ramos blasts DOT for building only 23 of 150 mandated bus miles. Myrie pledges to exceed the city’s 30-mile annual target. Lander wants immediate all-door boarding and new busways. Mamdani promises rapid expansion and free buses. Each candidate frames bus reform as urgent, with vulnerable riders suffering most from delays and car dominance. The city’s next mayor will shape the streets—and the safety of those who use them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, titled 'Decision 2025: Mayoral Question 2 Seeks Answers on Slow Buses,' asked candidates how they would fix New York’s slowest-in-the-nation bus system. Brad Lander, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, Whitney Tilson, Zellnor Myrie, and Zohran Mamdani answered. They called for more bus lanes, stronger enforcement, and faster service. No council bill was introduced; this was a public policy test, not legislation. According to the safety analyst, the event discussed bus speeds but did not specify any policy action affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so no direct safety impact can be assessed. The debate showed urgency but left vulnerable road users waiting for real change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death.

The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to conduct a comprehensive Environmental Impact Study on the viability of the proposed QueensLink project.' Council Member Robert F. Holden led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Ariola, Banks, Joseph, Gennaro, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. All committee members voted 'affirmative.' The QueensLink would restore 3.5 miles of dormant rail, linking northern and southern Queens, and could serve tens of thousands daily. The Council demands a full study before any track is laid, seeking facts on impact, cost, and safety for all who move through Queens.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.'

The poll surveyed 854 likely voters. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, who has championed free bus service since 2020, celebrated the results, saying, 'We know from our historic pilot program that free buses work: more riders, safer trips, cleaner air.' The MTA previously ran free bus pilots, reporting increased ridership and fewer operator assaults, though the agency questioned whether new riders joined. Danielle Deiseroth, Executive Director of Data for Progress, noted, 'People love free stuff.' The poll’s strong bipartisan support signals growing momentum for fare-free transit.

Cuomo called for a new city bureaucracy and stricter enforcement, saying, 'There’s virtually no rules and no regulations regarding e-bike use in New York City and too many New Yorkers are getting hurt, and even killed.' At a campaign event, Cuomo called bike lanes 'crazy.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani criticized the plan, warning it would 'increase unwarranted police stops and create a bureaucratic nightmare.' Comptroller Brad Lander said Cuomo's proposal 'puts his failure to govern on the backs of delivery workers.' Safety experts and advocates argue the plan would not improve safety, but instead target delivery workers—many undocumented—while cars and trucks remain the main source of road violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
