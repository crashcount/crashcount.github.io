Three people are dead. Four more are seriously injured. Four hundred and seven have been hurt since 2022. The wounds are not abstract. They are faces split open, legs broken, lives cut short. The dead do not speak. The living limp on.</p><p>Just last week, a 24-year-old cyclist and two pedestrians were struck at the intersection of Jackson Avenue and Queens Boulevard. The crash left bodies bruised and a city unmoved. The cause: failure to yield, traffic control ignored. The street stayed open. The pain stayed private. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the crash record</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The violence is not random. SUVs and cars hit most often. Trucks, bikes, mopeds—they all draw blood. The city counts the bodies. It does not count the cost to the families. One man, 58, was killed crossing Jackson Avenue. The record says he was crossing against the light. The record does not say who mourned him.</p><p>A 43-year-old e-bike rider was crushed by a bus. The record says &ldquo;traffic control disregarded.&rdquo; The record does not say why the street was built for speed, not safety.</p><h3 id=leaders-moveslowly>Leaders Move—Slowly</h3><p>Council Member Julie Won has voted for safer streets. She backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalized jaywalking</a>, ending a rule that punished the walker, not the driver. She co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. But the pace is slow. The city promises daylight at a thousand corners a year. The corners stay dark.</p><p>The council voted to warn taxi passengers to look for cyclists before opening doors. A sticker on a window. A small thing. The big things—protected lanes, slower speeds, real enforcement—wait for another day.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member <a href=mailto:district26@council.nyc.gov>Julie Won</a>. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand daylight at every corner. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
