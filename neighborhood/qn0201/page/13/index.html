A man, 58, crossing Jackson Avenue, struck dead at the intersection. A 43-year-old e-bike rider, crushed by a bus at Queens Boulevard. A 30-year-old, thrown from his moped, left lifeless on 44 Drive. The numbers are cold, but the loss is not. Every crash leaves a hole—a family waiting for a voice that will not come home.</p><h2 id=broken-crossings-broken-promises>Broken Crossings, Broken Promises</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Intersections like Jackson Avenue and Queens Boulevard are killing fields. Pedestrians and cyclists are hit where the city should protect them most. The data shows the pattern: failure to yield, unsafe speed, distraction. The city knows these truths. Still, the bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Council Member Julie Won has backed real change.</strong> She helped secure funding for the Queens Boulevard redesign, which brought a 68% drop in deaths and a 35% fall in injuries since 2015. The redesign added protected bike lanes and pedestrian islands. &ldquo;Queens Boulevard is not the Boulevard of Death anymore, but the Boulevard of Life,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/dot-completion-of-queens-boulevard-redesign/>in November 2024</a>.</p><p>Won also voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She pushed for daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines.

The event, covered by amny.com, called for a $300 million boost to the governor's plan, aiming to cut subway headways to six minutes, make buses free, and avoid fare hikes. The coalition, including the Riders Alliance and TWU Local 100, argued that current service leaves riders waiting over ten minutes and crawling on slow buses. Mamdani, prime sponsor of the Fix the MTA package, said, 'They are at risk of being priced out of one of their most basic human rights, the right to go around their city.' He pushed for higher corporate taxes to fund these improvements. TWU Local 100 president Richard Davis and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams also spoke out against service cuts.

The hearing, part of the state budget process, saw Lieber defend Governor Hochul’s proposed 5.5-percent fare increase as a return to regular hikes paused during the pandemic. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and colleagues pushed the 'Fix the MTA' package to freeze fares, boost service, and make buses free. Mamdani argued, 'It is simply not acceptable to put the cost of a basic public good on the backs of working class New Yorkers.' Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris criticized Lieber for insisting on fare hikes while dismissing other budget solutions. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas opposed making her constituents pay more. Lieber expressed concern about free buses, preferring targeted affordability programs. The hearing highlighted a sharp divide: lawmakers want to protect riders; the MTA wants stable funding.
