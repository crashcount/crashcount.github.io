Three people are dead. Four more are seriously injured. Four hundred and seven have been hurt since 2022. The wounds are not abstract. They are faces split open, legs broken, lives cut short. The dead do not speak. The living limp on.</p><p>Just last week, a 24-year-old cyclist and two pedestrians were struck at the intersection of Jackson Avenue and Queens Boulevard. The crash left bodies bruised and a city unmoved. The cause: failure to yield, traffic control ignored. The street stayed open. The pain stayed private. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the crash record</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The violence is not random. SUVs and cars hit most often. Trucks, bikes, mopeds—they all draw blood. The city counts the bodies. It does not count the cost to the families. One man, 58, was killed crossing Jackson Avenue. The record says he was crossing against the light. The record does not say who mourned him.</p><p>A 43-year-old e-bike rider was crushed by a bus. The record says &ldquo;traffic control disregarded.&rdquo; The record does not say why the street was built for speed, not safety.</p><h3 id=leaders-moveslowly>Leaders Move—Slowly</h3><p>Council Member Julie Won has voted for safer streets. She backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalized jaywalking</a>, ending a rule that punished the walker, not the driver. She co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. But the pace is slow. The city promises daylight at a thousand corners a year. The corners stay dark.</p><p>The council voted to warn taxi passengers to look for cyclists before opening doors. A sticker on a window. A small thing. The big things—protected lanes, slower speeds, real enforcement—wait for another day.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member <a href=mailto:district26@council.nyc.gov>Julie Won</a>. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand daylight at every corner. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, covered by amny.com, called for a $300 million boost to the governor's plan, aiming to cut subway headways to six minutes, make buses free, and avoid fare hikes. The coalition, including the Riders Alliance and TWU Local 100, argued that current service leaves riders waiting over ten minutes and crawling on slow buses. Mamdani, prime sponsor of the Fix the MTA package, said, 'They are at risk of being priced out of one of their most basic human rights, the right to go around their city.' He pushed for higher corporate taxes to fund these improvements. TWU Local 100 president Richard Davis and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams also spoke out against service cuts. The governor's office did not endorse Mamdani's tax proposal.

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint.

The hearing, part of the state budget process, saw Lieber defend Governor Hochul’s proposed 5.5-percent fare increase as a return to regular hikes paused during the pandemic. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and colleagues pushed the 'Fix the MTA' package to freeze fares, boost service, and make buses free. Mamdani argued, 'It is simply not acceptable to put the cost of a basic public good on the backs of working class New Yorkers.' Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris criticized Lieber for insisting on fare hikes while dismissing other budget solutions. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas opposed making her constituents pay more. Lieber expressed concern about free buses, preferring targeted affordability programs.

Riders face a 5.5% fare hike. No new service. City pays more. Lawmakers and advocates warn: the fix is short-term. Vulnerable riders left exposed. The system stays fragile.</p><p class=mb3>On February 2, 2023, the state unveiled a budget proposal to fund the MTA. The plan, discussed in committee, includes a one-time $300 million payment, a payroll mobility tax hike, and future casino revenue. The matter summary reads: 'Gov. Hochul's Fiscal Year 2024 budget aims to prevent the MTA from facing a fiscal crisis, but leaves the search for more transit service and ways to avoid fare hikes to the state legislature.' Council Member Robert Carroll is mentioned. The proposal does not expand service or prevent a 5.5% fare hike. Advocates like Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani criticize the plan for failing low-income New Yorkers. Comptroller Brad Lander calls for congestion pricing and more sustainable funding. The city faces a heavier financial load, but the budget offers no long-term fix for riders’ safety or affordability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Amanda Farías introduced a resolution backing six-minute service.
