Four left with injuries so grave they may never heal.</strong> In the last three years, the streets of Long Island City-Hunters Point have not forgiven a single mistake. A 58-year-old man, crossing at Jackson Avenue, died in the dark hours of April. A 43-year-old e-bike rider, crushed by a bus at Queens Boulevard. A 30-year-old, thrown from his moped, never stood up again. The numbers are small only if you do not know their names.</p><p><strong>In the past twelve months:</strong> 129 people injured, one left with life-altering wounds. No deaths, but the dice keep rolling. Most victims are young. Most are walking, riding, or crossing. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=the-machines-cars-trucks-and-the-cost-of-speed>The Machines: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost of Speed</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm.</strong> They killed once, left ten with moderate injuries, and one with injuries called “serious.” Trucks and buses struck too. Bikes and mopeds, unprotected, paid in blood. The street does not care who is right. It only takes.</p><h3 id=the-system-promises-delays-and-the-weight-of-silence>The System: Promises, Delays, and the Weight of Silence</h3><p><strong>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same.</strong> The city claims progress. They point to new laws, new cameras, new limits. But the blood dries on the concrete all the same. In April, a bolt from the No. 7 train crashed through a windshield at Queens Plaza. The driver, Rahimi, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/exclusive-debris-subway-tracks-shattered-mans-windshield-dented-car-queens/16217411/>said</a>, &ldquo;I thought we were being shot at at the time because the velocity of the metal it hit so hard that for a second I thought it was a bullet.&rdquo; The city promises to inspect. The city promises to fix. The city promises.</p><p><strong>Vision Zero. Sammy’s Law. Speed cameras.</strong> The words are big. The actions are slow. The deaths are real.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-than-words>What Now: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the DOT.</strong> Tell them you want streets that do not kill. Tell them you want action, not another press release. Tell them you will not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) declined, offering only daylighting and crosswalk improvements.

Caban said, “We have to be bigger and we have to be bolder. We have to be thinking about traffic-calming measures across all of our intersections.” Advocates and officials criticized DOT’s reactive approach and urged proactive, community-driven safety changes.

They demanded daylighting, neckdowns, speed bumps, stop signs, and reflective markings at Newtown Road intersections. The lawmakers wrote, “Nothing can bring back Dolma Naadhun, but we can prevent further loss of life so that no family must experience the loss of a loved one.” DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed a Council bill mandating 100 daylighted intersections per year, arguing for flexibility and physical infrastructure in daylit spaces. Advocates and experts agree: daylighting without barriers is flawed. They call for curb extensions to slow drivers and protect people.

The project, coordinated with Council Member Julie Menin, used fiber-reinforced polymer panels to shield riders from the bridge’s hazardous metal grating. The official matter: 'Roosevelt Island Bridge bike lane now covered for a safer, smoother ride.' Won praised the project’s quick finish and its promise of safer, more comfortable biking. DOT and community leaders noted the new surface prevents slips and flats, separating cyclists from traffic.

City puts drivers first, safety last.</p><p class=mb3>On December 5, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) delayed expanding pedestrian and cyclist space on the Queensboro Bridge. The plan, promised by former Mayor Bill de Blasio, would have made the southern roadway pedestrian-only and the northern path bike-only by the end of 2022. Instead, DOT postponed this until at least late 2023, citing the need to keep seven of nine car lanes open during bridge rehabilitation. The matter summary states: 'The city is delaying the expansion of space for cyclists and pedestrians on the Queensboro Bridge, despite a significant increase in bike traffic.' Council Member Julie Won criticized the move, saying, 'The city must open the south outer roadway immediately for our safety. DOT should stop prioritizing cars over the safety of pedestrians.' Advocates point to rising bike ridership and crashes on the narrow shared path. DOT maintains the project cannot be expedited due to driver needs, despite evidence that more bike infrastructure boosts usage without hurting traffic elsewhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible.
