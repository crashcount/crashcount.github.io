A man, 58, crossing Jackson Avenue, struck dead at the intersection. A 43-year-old e-bike rider, crushed by a bus at Queens Boulevard. A 30-year-old, thrown from his moped, left lifeless on 44 Drive.

Every crash leaves a hole—a family waiting for a voice that will not come home.</p><h2 id=broken-crossings-broken-promises>Broken Crossings, Broken Promises</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Intersections like Jackson Avenue and Queens Boulevard are killing fields. Pedestrians and cyclists are hit where the city should protect them most. The data shows the pattern: failure to yield, unsafe speed, distraction. The city knows these truths. Still, the bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Council Member Julie Won has backed real change.</strong> She helped secure funding for the Queens Boulevard redesign, which brought a 68% drop in deaths and a 35% fall in injuries since 2015. The redesign added protected bike lanes and pedestrian islands. &ldquo;Queens Boulevard is not the Boulevard of Death anymore, but the Boulevard of Life,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/dot-completion-of-queens-boulevard-redesign/>in November 2024</a>.</p><p>Won also voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She pushed for daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines. She stood with advocates for the Blissville Greenway, a bike lane where cyclists had died before, as reported by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/07/case-closed-judge-allows-dot-to-build-a-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. The crossings are still dangerous. The city moves slow. Too many bills sit in committee. Too many families wait for justice.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who delay, who settle for half-measures, who let drivers rule the road. Call your council member. Demand more protected lanes, more daylighting, more action. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

It claims intersections with banned parking see more injuries. Critics slam the data. Councilmember Julie Won pushes a bill for universal daylighting, citing lives lost. Advocates say the report ignores proven safety gains in other cities.</p><p class=mb3>On January 18, 2025, the Department of Transportation released a report challenging the safety benefits of universal daylighting, as a City Council bill requiring it gained momentum. The report, discussed in the Transportation Committee, found higher injury rates at intersections where parking is banned, but DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton, admitted they could not prove daylighting causes more injuries. The matter summary states: 'Universal daylighting, as evidenced in DOT’s hydrant zone analysis, does not have the widespread safety benefits anticipated and may have negative effects on safety.' Councilmember Julie Won, the bill’s sponsor, argued, 'That could've been prevented with universal daylighting,' referencing children killed by traffic violence. The bill has 20 co-sponsors. Advocates and researchers, including Marcel Moran and Alex Morano, criticized the report’s lack of data and focus on negatives, noting no city has improved safety by blocking visibility. The report’s timing drew skepticism as cities like San Francisco and Hoboken have seen safety gains from daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates demand real protection, not empty space.</p><p class=mb3>On January 17, 2025, Councilmember Julie Won (District 26) introduced a bill mandating universal daylighting at all New York City intersections. The bill, now under council debate, follows a DOT study required by earlier council legislation. The study’s summary: 'simply removing parking or adding signage had little or even negative impact on safety, with injury rates 30% higher at intersections with only hydrant zones.' Won said, 'Daylighting must be supplemented with hardened barriers like planters and boulders.' DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton warned that sign-only daylighting can actually increase danger by letting drivers speed through wider turns. Advocates and DOT officials agree: daylighting without physical barriers fails to protect. The bill’s fate now rests with the council and the mayor’s pledge to daylight 1,000 intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.'

Riley is the primary sponsor, joined by Ariola, Joseph, Moya, Won, Banks, Narcisse, Paladino, and Marmorato. Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children.

The law requires the Department of Transportation to consult with the Fire Department before approving open street applications, bicycle lane projects, or major transportation projects. The official matter title states the law amends the city code to require DOT to consult with FDNY and notify affected firehouses before moving forward. Primary sponsor Kalman Yeger, with co-sponsors including Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, Lynn Schulman, and others, pushed the bill through. The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes. No safety analyst assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users.

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On December 6, 2024, Council Member Julie Won (D-Queens) introduced a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of all intersections citywide—a measure known as daylighting. The bill, now before the City Council, would require the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The matter summary states: 'Parking right up against intersections blocks sight lines for pedestrians and drivers, leading to people to have to peak out into the street to see oncoming traffic.' Won said, 'Daylighting saves lives.' Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans back the bill, citing slow DOT progress and urgent need. Intersections account for 55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries, according to DOT. The bill follows a year of tragic child deaths and mounting public pressure for universal daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Senator Zellnor Myrie, representing District 20, called for a dedicated busway on Brooklyn's Flatbush Avenue, echoing the success of Manhattan's 14th Street. The forum, hosted by Riders Alliance, saw candidates—including Myrie, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, and Jim Walden—debate urgent transit reforms. The matter: 'improving NYC's slow bus service.' Myrie and others backed more bus lanes, fare-free buses, and expanding Fair Fares for low-income riders. Mamdani vowed not to cave to local opposition. All criticized Mayor Adams for stalled bus projects. The forum exposed deep frustration with city inaction and highlighted the need for bold, street-level changes to protect riders and speed up commutes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
