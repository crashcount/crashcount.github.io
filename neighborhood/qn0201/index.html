A man, 58, crossing Jackson Avenue, struck dead at the intersection. A 43-year-old e-bike rider, crushed by a bus at Queens Boulevard. A 30-year-old, thrown from his moped, left lifeless on 44 Drive. The numbers are cold, but the loss is not. Every crash leaves a hole—a family waiting for a voice that will not come home.</p><h2 id=broken-crossings-broken-promises>Broken Crossings, Broken Promises</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Intersections like Jackson Avenue and Queens Boulevard are killing fields. Pedestrians and cyclists are hit where the city should protect them most. The data shows the pattern: failure to yield, unsafe speed, distraction. The city knows these truths. Still, the bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Council Member Julie Won has backed real change.</strong> She helped secure funding for the Queens Boulevard redesign, which brought a 68% drop in deaths and a 35% fall in injuries since 2015. The redesign added protected bike lanes and pedestrian islands. &ldquo;Queens Boulevard is not the Boulevard of Death anymore, but the Boulevard of Life,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/dot-completion-of-queens-boulevard-redesign/>in November 2024</a>.</p><p>Won also voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She pushed for daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines. She stood with advocates for the Blissville Greenway, a bike lane where cyclists had died before, as reported by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/07/case-closed-judge-allows-dot-to-build-a-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. The crossings are still dangerous. The city moves slow. Too many bills sit in committee. Too many families wait for justice.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who delay, who settle for half-measures, who let drivers rule the road. Call your council member. Demand more protected lanes, more daylighting, more action. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Federal Secretary Duffy objects. Critics say his stance ignores history and safety. The bridge once belonged to walkers. Now, the city returns space to people, not cars. Tensions flare. Vulnerable users watch.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the Adams administration's move to open a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge. The event, not a council bill but a city action, drew sharp criticism from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who opposed removing a vehicle lane for pedestrians and cyclists. The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.' Still, the move restores space to those on foot and bike, challenging car dominance and federal resistance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, organized by Riders Alliance, demanded better bus service and more bus lanes on Flatbush Avenue. Mamdani declared, 'We are going to make the slowest buses in the country fast and free.' City Comptroller Brad Lander echoed the urgency, calling mass transit 'the lifeblood of NYC.' The rally criticized Mayor Adams and former Governor Cuomo for failing bus riders and not meeting the NYC Streets Plan’s promise of 10 to 15 new bus lanes each year. Betsy Plum of Riders Alliance said, 'He was meant to be implementing the NYC Streets Plan... He has woefully failed at that.' The rally spotlighted the daily risks and delays faced by bus riders, who remain among the city’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He claims police issue red-light summonses to cyclists who cross intersections with the white pedestrian walk signal, despite a 2019 law permitting this. The article quotes Transportation Alternatives: “That 5-7 second head start can mean the difference between being hit by a turning car and being seen by a turning car.” Esparza says officers ignore the rule, issuing criminal summonses instead of traffic tickets. The suit highlights a gap between city policy and street enforcement, raising questions about NYPD training and the city’s commitment to safe cycling.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, detailed in his mayoral campaign, calls for fully staffing the Department of Transportation's bus unit, painting at least 30 miles of new bus lanes each year, and expanding transit signal priority. Mamdani says, 'There is a portion of that 'fast' that comes from the fact that if you make it free [you get] a faster ride.' He also pledges to lockbox dedicated funding for free service, citing his past work on MTA rescue packages. Mamdani and his allies point to a recent free bus pilot that increased ridership and reduced assaults. The proposal, if enacted, would shift street space from cars to buses, aiming to make public transit safer and more reliable for all riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Stringer demanded 'massive expansion of protected bike lanes.' Myrie backed S1047, a bill for 50-percent e-bike rebates. Ramos called for safe bike lanes and clear signage for all riders. Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes.
