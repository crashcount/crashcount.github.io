A car jumped the curb on 35th Avenue, crushing her femur and leaving her with a head wound. Her classmate, fourteen, was hit too. A man, fifty-eight, limped away with bruised legs. The driver had no license. Police called it &ldquo;reckless endangerment, reckless driving and driving without a license&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>said the NYPD</a>. The sidewalk offered no safety.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>167 people were injured and one killed</strong> on Astoria (Central) streets.

It demands hard numbers on vehicle flow, street damage, and danger to people outside cars.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0923-2023 was introduced on February 16, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint.

The hearing, part of the state budget process, saw Lieber defend Governor Hochul’s proposed 5.5-percent fare increase as a return to regular hikes paused during the pandemic. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and colleagues pushed the 'Fix the MTA' package to freeze fares, boost service, and make buses free. Mamdani argued, 'It is simply not acceptable to put the cost of a basic public good on the backs of working class New Yorkers.' Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris criticized Lieber for insisting on fare hikes while dismissing other budget solutions. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas opposed making her constituents pay more. Lieber expressed concern about free buses, preferring targeted affordability programs. The hearing highlighted a sharp divide: lawmakers want to protect riders; the MTA wants stable funding.

The plan, described as aiming to 'expand our public transit access, affordability, safety,' includes a one-time $300 million state payment, a payroll mobility tax hike, and casino revenue estimated at $462–$826 million annually. The city would pay $500 million more each year. MTA Chair Janno Lieber praised the plan for preserving service without cuts. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani criticized it for raising fares and failing low-income riders. Mayor Adams and Comptroller Lander objected to the city’s increased burden, calling for congestion pricing and opposing fare hikes. The budget does not expand service or secure long-term funding, leaving vulnerable riders exposed to higher costs and stagnant service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in committee, includes a one-time $300 million payment, a payroll mobility tax hike, and future casino revenue. The matter summary reads: 'Gov. Hochul's Fiscal Year 2024 budget aims to prevent the MTA from facing a fiscal crisis, but leaves the search for more transit service and ways to avoid fare hikes to the state legislature.' Council Member Robert Carroll is mentioned. The proposal does not expand service or prevent a 5.5% fare hike. Advocates like Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani criticize the plan for failing low-income New Yorkers. Comptroller Brad Lander calls for congestion pricing and more sustainable funding. The city faces a heavier financial load, but the budget offers no long-term fix for riders’ safety or affordability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous.
