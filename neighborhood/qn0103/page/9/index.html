This is an illustration of political malpractice of the highest order."" -- Zohran Mamdani</p><p class=mb3>On June 5, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul abruptly paused New York City’s congestion pricing plan, just weeks before its scheduled start. The policy reversal, covered by Gothamist, sparked outrage among transit advocates and progressives. Hochul claimed, 'We need to make sure our solutions work for everyone, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet.' Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani condemned the move as 'political malpractice.' Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, District 23, was mentioned in coverage but did not take a direct action. The decision leaves the city’s streets congested and public transit funding uncertain.

No more hiding the truth.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0745-2024, now enacted, came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced April 11, 2024, and became law September 14, 2024, as Local Law 88. The law’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Schulman, Hudson, Restler, and others. The law forces DOT to publish monthly and annual data on bike and micromobility use, plus crash and safety project details. The city must show where riders go, where danger lurks, and what it does to fix it. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it stands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He built too few bus lanes. Riders wait. Buses crawl. Council Member Mamdani calls him out. City Hall dodges. Streets stay clogged. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price. The city drags its feet. The danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>This is not a bill, but a policy failure. In 2022, city law required 20 miles of new bus lanes. Adams built 12.9. In 2023, the law demanded 30 miles. Only 7.8 appeared. Council Member Zohran Kwame Mamdani slammed the mayor: 'How can he call himself a law and order mayor, when New Yorkers can’t trust him to follow the law?' The Adams administration, through spokesperson Liz Garcia, claimed progress: 'We continue to work with our partners in the MTA and with communities across the city to build on this record of success.' But the numbers tell a harsher story. Bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. Riders, many with no other option, face longer waits and slower trips. The city’s failure to build bus lanes leaves streets more dangerous for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
