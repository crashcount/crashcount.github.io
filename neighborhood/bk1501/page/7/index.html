The driver had a suspended license and <strong>over 93 traffic violations</strong>. She was still behind the wheel. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/29/us-news/driver-accused-of-mowing-down-mom-her-two-daughters-in-nyc-crash-is-big-spending-wigmaker-who-won-2m-from-nypd-lawsuit/>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;Miriam Yarimi, 32, a mother of one, was driving her Audi on a suspended license&mldr; when she got into a collision&mldr; and careened into and killed a mother and two children who were leaving Shabbat services.&rdquo; The car had just sped through a school zone weeks before. The city let it happen.</p><p>Elsewhere, a 24-year-old drove drunk through Coney Island Avenue at 2 a.m., slamming into a Volvo, then an NYPD cruiser. Two officers hospitalized. A passenger thrown from the car, left in critical condition. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/15/brooklyn-drunk-driver-hurts-2-passengers-2-nypd-cops-in-chain-reaction-crash/>reported</a> that &ldquo;one police officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, as well as head trauma, while another suffered a broken hip.&rdquo; The driver refused a blood test. He was charged with DWI and reckless endangerment.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-excuses>Leadership: Action or Excuses?</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have the power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit still stands at 25. Dangerous Vehicle Abatement lapsed. Cameras that catch speeders face expiration. The city talks about Vision Zero, but the dead keep piling up.</p><p>Mayor Adams called for a full investigation after the Ocean Parkway killings. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/glam-wigmaker-accused-of-killing-mom-2-young-kids-in-horror-brooklyn-crash-charged-with-manslaughter/>He commented on the tragedy</a>, emphasizing the importance of investigating the incident fully. But investigations don’t bring back the dead. Lower speeds do. Cameras do. Real enforcement does.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand the city take the keys from repeat offenders. Don’t wait for another child’s name in the news. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
