The driver had a suspended license and <strong>over 93 traffic violations</strong>. She was still behind the wheel. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/29/us-news/driver-accused-of-mowing-down-mom-her-two-daughters-in-nyc-crash-is-big-spending-wigmaker-who-won-2m-from-nypd-lawsuit/>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;Miriam Yarimi, 32, a mother of one, was driving her Audi on a suspended license&mldr; when she got into a collision&mldr; and careened into and killed a mother and two children who were leaving Shabbat services.&rdquo; The car had just sped through a school zone weeks before. The city let it happen.</p><p>Elsewhere, a 24-year-old drove drunk through Coney Island Avenue at 2 a.m., slamming into a Volvo, then an NYPD cruiser. Two officers hospitalized. A passenger thrown from the car, left in critical condition. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/15/brooklyn-drunk-driver-hurts-2-passengers-2-nypd-cops-in-chain-reaction-crash/>reported</a> that &ldquo;one police officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, as well as head trauma, while another suffered a broken hip.&rdquo; The driver refused a blood test. He was charged with DWI and reckless endangerment.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-excuses>Leadership: Action or Excuses?</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have the power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit still stands at 25. Dangerous Vehicle Abatement lapsed. Cameras that catch speeders face expiration. The city talks about Vision Zero, but the dead keep piling up.</p><p>Mayor Adams called for a full investigation after the Ocean Parkway killings. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/glam-wigmaker-accused-of-killing-mom-2-young-kids-in-horror-brooklyn-crash-charged-with-manslaughter/>He commented on the tragedy</a>, emphasizing the importance of investigating the incident fully. But investigations don’t bring back the dead. Lower speeds do. Cameras do. Real enforcement does.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand the city take the keys from repeat offenders. Don’t wait for another child’s name in the news. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031.

Police said the driver, spotted near Brighton Beach, "maneuvered onto the service road in [the] direction of several officers who set up a roadblock to stop this vehicle." When the driver "veered toward one of the officers and nearly hit him," an officer fired, striking the driver. The car continued another mile before crashing again. The driver died at Brookdale Hospital. The incident was captured on police body cameras. Officers were treated at local hospitals but not injured. The article notes this was the fourth fatal police shooting by NYPD in 2025. The event highlights risks of high-speed chases and the dangers posed by fleeing vehicles near roadblocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low.

The system failed to stop the car.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-04-01) reports renewed calls for the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill after a Brooklyn crash killed a mother and two children. The driver, with a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' struck the family as they crossed the street. The bill would require speed-limiting technology for drivers with repeated offenses—those with 11 or more points in 24 months, or six camera tickets in a year. Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, citing the crash, demand action: 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair... it’s time for us to act.' The incident highlights gaps in enforcement and the stalled progress of safety legislation meant to curb reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Twenty dead since 2014. Two children and their mother, gone in a flash. Drivers speed, run lights, break rules. Cameras are rare. Residents demand action. Felder stalls. The road stays deadly. Pedestrians pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On April 1, 2025, after a fatal crash on Ocean Parkway, the New York City Council debated speed limits and automated enforcement. The matter, described as 'Notorious NYC road where wacky wigmaker Miriam Yarimi allegedly killed mom, 2 kids has dangerous history,' highlights a grim toll: 20 deaths since 2014, nearly 2,400 injuries since 2012. State Senator Simcha Felder, representing District 44, has opposed lowering the speed limit and even proposed raising it, despite calls from residents and advocates for stronger safety measures. Felder said, 'Some have wasted no time using this tragedy as an opportunity to advance their agenda. There is a time to act but there is also a time to mourn...' Mayor Eric Adams signaled openness to lowering the speed limit to 20 mph. Advocates push for speed cameras and mandatory speed-limiting tech for repeat offenders. Still, Ocean Parkway remains one of Brooklyn’s most dangerous roads for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
