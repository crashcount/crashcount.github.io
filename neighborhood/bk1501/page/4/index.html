Six seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months, 405 crashes tore through Gravesend (East)-Homecrest. Two children died. A mother died. Their lives ended in the crosswalk, in daylight, with the signal. These numbers are not just statistics. They are families left with empty beds and cold kitchens.</p><h3 id=a-family-erased-on-ocean-parkway>A Family Erased on Ocean Parkway</h3><p>On March 29, a mother and her two daughters were killed crossing Ocean Parkway. The driver had a suspended license and a record of more than 93 violations, including 15 school zone speeding and red-light tickets in the last year. The car did not stop. The street did not forgive. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/29/us-news/two-kids-killed-9-injured-in-gruesome-nyc-car-crash/>&ldquo;This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn&rsquo;t have been on the road,&rdquo;</a> said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The four-year-old son survived, but the father lost half his family in one day.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The city talks about speed cameras and lower limits. But the dead keep coming. The driver who killed the Saada family had over $10,000 in unpaid fines. The system let her drive. The law let her stay behind the wheel. The city let her pass.</p><p>Mayor Adams called for a full investigation, saying the tragedy &ldquo;demands answers&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/glam-wigmaker-accused-of-killing-mom-2-young-kids-in-horror-brooklyn-crash-charged-with-manslaughter/>after the crash</a>. But answers are not action. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The cameras catch speeders, but the city does not always act on what they see.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call your council member. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets that put people before cars. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in blood. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
