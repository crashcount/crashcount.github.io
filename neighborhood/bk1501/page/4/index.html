Anthony Palumbo and Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposed the super speeder bill, citing government overreach. Sen. Leroy Comrie opposed the Idaho stop bill, citing concerns for seniors. Separately, Senate bill S533, which aimed to block congestion pricing, was defeated in the Senate Transportation Committee. Chair Jeremy Cooney stressed, 'You have to have a plan. If you don’t have a plan, what are [you] doing to get the $15 billion revenue?'

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031.

It would require speed limiter technology for drivers with six or more automated enforcement tickets in a year. The bill is supported by Amber Adler of Families for Safe Streets and Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, who call out the deadly pattern of repeat offenders. Furnas says, 'These results point to a small population with a shocking pattern of recidivism, resistance to traditional deterrents, and disregard for human life.' Adler points to a recent fatal crash by a repeat offender as proof of legislative failure. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposes the bill, claiming six tickets is not excessive. The NYPD withholds license plate data, blocking public scrutiny. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has expired, leaving no replacement. Advocates say the bill is urgent to stop the next tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The local community board and Vernikov demanded a one-to-one parking ratio. Rachel Fee, an advocate, called it 'inexcusable' to have more parking than homes in a transit-rich city.

The crash ended three lives on a Brooklyn street.</p><p class=mb3>According to the NY Daily News (2025-04-06), Miriam Yarimi drove her Audi at high speed through a red light in Midwood, Brooklyn, on March 29, with a suspended license. Police and prosecutors state she struck and killed a mother and her two young children. The article quotes, "Yarimi was speeding in her Audi when she ran a red light and struck the family." Yarimi told first responders she was 'possessed' at the time. The report highlights her suspended license and excessive speed, both clear driver errors. The case underscores ongoing risks for pedestrians and families on city streets, and raises questions about license enforcement and traffic safety in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Six lanes, fast cars, old design. State and city spent millions. Speed cameras blink. Still, people die. Politicians block real change. Residents demand more. Enforcement alone fails. The danger remains. Blood stains the asphalt.</p><p class=mb3>"Assembly Member Michael Novakhov recently told Streetsblog he thinks the speed limit is too slow on Ocean Parkway." -- Misha Novakhov</p><p class=mb3>On April 4, 2025, public debate erupted over Ocean Parkway’s safety. The matter, described as 'Tragedy Underscores Shortcomings of Vision Zero Era State Ocean Parkway Fixes,' highlights the failure of current efforts. Despite millions spent on speed cameras and signals, the six-lane highway remains deadly. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov called for higher speed limits. State Senator Simcha Felder pushed for a 30 mph limit, above the citywide standard. Advocates like Jon Orcutt demand deeper redesigns—lane reductions, pedestrian islands. Residents and experts say enforcement alone cannot save lives. Local opposition and political power block bold changes. The city DOT promises more work, but the danger persists. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
