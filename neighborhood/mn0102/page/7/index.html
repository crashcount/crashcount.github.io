The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations," creates a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 2,640 feet of a school. The penalty is $175 per violation. The Department of Transportation must launch a civilian reporting program. If DOT prosecutes a case using civilian evidence, the complainant gets 25% of the proceeds. Council Member Carlina Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Joseph, Menin, Nurse, Hudson, Brannan, Farías, Brewer, Salaam, Hanif, Avilés, Won, Bottcher, Krishnan, Gutiérrez, Marte, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aims to keep streets clear for vulnerable road users, especially near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Local officials and advocates warn of rising danger for pedestrians and cyclists. The plan ignores transit alternatives and threatens Lower Manhattan’s safety and air.</p><p class=mb3>On November 7, 2023, New Jersey revealed its $11-billion plan to widen the Jersey Turnpike, doubling lanes between Newark Airport and the Hudson River tunnels. The project, detailed in a recent environmental review, will increase traffic by 32 percent by 2050, sending more than 1,200 extra cars per hour into Manhattan during morning peak. The Turnpike Authority claims the expansion is needed for congestion relief, but the review did not consider public transit alternatives. Council Member Christopher Marte opposes the plan, warning, 'our health, safety, and transit could all be severely worsened.' Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop urges investment in mass transit instead. Juan Restrepo of Transportation Alternatives calls for reducing car dependency. The NYC Department of Transportation is studying Canal Street redesigns for vulnerable users, but has not addressed evening impacts. Advocates demand action to protect pedestrians and cyclists from the looming surge in traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
