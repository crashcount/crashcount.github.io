The crackdown targets delivery workers, especially undocumented riders, for offenses like sidewalk riding and nonstandard bike setups. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the move, stating, 'When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.' Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called it 'really inappropriate escalation.'
