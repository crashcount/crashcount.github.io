Marte declared, 'It shouldn't just be a vote to get 30 miles of additional bus lanes. That should be the minimum.' The rally pressed the city to prioritize bus lanes, bike lanes, and pedestrian-oriented streets, echoing the Streets Master Plan. No formal bill was under consideration, but the council and advocates pushed for $3.1 billion in funding for these changes.

Marte pledged support for urgent changes. The op-ed notes that pedestrians are 65% of users but get as little as 10% of street space. Residents demand widened sidewalks, protected bike lanes, and enforcement against double-parking and crosswalk invasions. The call is clear: shift space from cars to people.

The matter summary states the bill 'would bar on-demand grocery apps from advertising 15-minute delivery times, citing threats to worker and pedestrian safety.' Marte, representing District 1, argues that these ads pressure delivery workers on e-bikes and scooters to break traffic laws, endangering themselves and pedestrians.

The measure, described as a 'critical project' by DOT, aims to catch and fine overweight trucks using new sensors. Restler said, 'There are extremely overweight trucks barreling down the triple cantilever every single day that are a hazard to the health and safety of our community.' DOT claims the system will be operational by year’s end, citing technical complexity. The Brooklyn Heights Association and local officials demand faster action. The pilot is the first of its kind in the nation. Until sensors are live, the BQE remains a danger zone for everyone not behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
