City drags its feet. Council set aside funds. DOT stalls. Pedestrians and cyclists wait. Business objections ring hollow. The mayor ignores the crisis. The call is clear: clear the streets for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>This is an opinion piece published July 11, 2022, titled 'Pedestrianize the Financial District Now!' It urges immediate action on the 'Make Way for Lower Manhattan' plan, which would turn streets below Chambers into shared spaces for walkers and cyclists. The Financial District Neighborhood Association backs the plan. Former Council Member Margaret Chin allocated $500,000 for early work in 2019. The Department of Transportation has not moved forward. The piece states, 'Any pedestrianization plan worth its salt will curtail the space for government-subsidized 'free' car storage.' The author slams the mayor for ignoring placard abuse and calls business objections a smokescreen. The plan’s delay keeps narrow, dangerous streets clogged with government vehicles, putting vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
