In three years, they killed six and left dozens with injuries that will never heal.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city claims progress. They point to new speed cameras, lower speed limits, and intersection redesigns. But on these blocks, the carnage continues. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. Laws allow lower limits, but the city drags its feet. The dead do not wait for policy.</p><p>Local boards and advocates have pushed for safer crossings, split bike and pedestrian paths, and more space for people. The city <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/cyclists-pedestrians-paths-queensboro-bridge/>opened a separate pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge</a> after years of pressure. But every delay is another risk. Every unprotected crossing is a coin toss.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand the citywide 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras, more protected crossings, more space for people, not cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p><p>The numbers are not just numbers.

Adams admits the plan is 'an idea' needing state approval and a lengthy rulemaking process. Critics like Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives call the proposal 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' arguing it unfairly targets cyclists while drivers face lesser consequences for greater harm. Janet Schroeder of the NYC E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the limit will matter without enforcement: 'The 15 mph speed limit does nothing.'

Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.'

The article details heated opposition from local residents and bus riders, who argued the plan was rushed and lacked proper traffic analysis. Stacy Rauch, a daily bus rider, said, 'The bigger problem is we don’t have enough buses.' Critics worried diverted car traffic would overwhelm nearby streets. The city compared the move to the 14th Street car ban, but residents noted differences in bus frequency.

Cyclists using the Hudson River greenway must share space with highway-bound vehicles. The $150-million project includes only a painted, unprotected lane. DOT official Colleen Chattergoon said, "With the space that we have, we cannot accommodate a protected bike lane in that area." The city has not acted on a 2019 resolution calling for real protection. Community members and advocates question the safety of the design, especially for children. Officials promised to review the resolution but gave no timeline or details.

She woke in pain, face broken, spine injured. NYPD cracks down with criminal summonses. Cyclists protest. City Council stalls. Streets stay dangerous. Justice, tangled in policy.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on May 30, 2025, that the NYPD is issuing criminal summonses to e-bike riders for traffic infractions, citing a lack of City Council action on new regulations. Commissioner Tisch told the Council, "Pass e-bike regulations." Cyclists object to criminal charges for minor violations, arguing for civil penalties instead. The article highlights the case of Renee Baruch, hospitalized after an e-bike crash left her with facial fractures and a spinal injury. The NYPD’s new Quality of Life Division targets reckless e-bike use, but without updated laws, criminal summonses remain their only tool. The policy gap leaves vulnerable road users exposed and enforcement inconsistent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The $9 toll stands. Streets stay crowded. The fight moves to court. Safety projects hang in the balance. The city waits. The deadline looms.</p><p class=mb3>Patch reported on May 27, 2025, that District Judge Lewis Liman issued a temporary restraining order blocking the U.S. Department of Transportation from withholding federal funding as leverage against New York City's congestion pricing program. The judge's order 'bars the DOT from engaging in any retaliatory measures' and prevents cancellation of the toll, which charges drivers $9 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. Federal officials had threatened to withhold funds for road and street safety projects if the city continued the program. The order lasts until June 9, keeping the toll in place and leaving critical infrastructure funding uncertain. The article highlights the standoff between federal authorities and city leaders, with safety and mobility projects at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
