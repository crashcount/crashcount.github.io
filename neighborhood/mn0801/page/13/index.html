Moments later, a 35-year-old woman driving a 2023 Chevrolet Trailblazer also struck her, police said.</a></p><p>On the FDR, a Tesla flipped and burned. The driver died. The passenger lived. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, bikes, mopeds</strong>—all have left blood on these streets. But the deadliest wounds come from cars and trucks. In three years, they killed six and left dozens with injuries that will never heal.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city claims progress. They point to new speed cameras, lower speed limits, and intersection redesigns. But on these blocks, the carnage continues. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. Laws allow lower limits, but the city drags its feet. The dead do not wait for policy.</p><p>Local boards and advocates have pushed for safer crossings, split bike and pedestrian paths, and more space for people. The city <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/cyclists-pedestrians-paths-queensboro-bridge/>opened a separate pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge</a> after years of pressure. But every delay is another risk. Every unprotected crossing is a coin toss.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand the citywide 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras, more protected crossings, more space for people, not cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p><p>The numbers are not just numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons. The slow disaster will not stop until leaders feel the heat. Make them feel it.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The project, not tied to a specific council bill, follows years of complaints from cyclists about the unsafe grates. DOT spokesperson Tomas Garita said, 'We are actively exploring and testing various materials that will improve safety and the overall cycling experience for all its users.' The pilot covers 300 metal panels on each side of the bridge and adds new flexible delineators. Local advocate Paul Krikler credited former Council Members Ben Kallos and Jimmy Van Bramer, and current Council Member Julie Menin, for securing funding. Cyclist Conor Lyman said the old surface kept riders away. The project is expected to finish by Thanksgiving, finally addressing a long-standing threat to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan marks the Adams administration's first major street project. The current avenue, with seven northbound car lanes, has seen 703 crashes, one pedestrian death, and 198 injuries since 2019. The matter summary calls for 'reallocation of street space, prioritizing cycling, walking, and public transit over cars.' Advocates like Kate Fillin-Yeh (NACTO) and Paul Krikler (Community Board 8) urge protected bike lanes, busways, and wider sidewalks. Krikler says, 'We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely.' Transportation Alternatives and Community Board 6 echo these demands. The redesign aims to shift space from cars to people, following models like Paris's Rue de Rivoli. The panel's response will shape the future of vulnerable road user safety on Third Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Marijuana Regulation & Taxation Act passed in March 2021. The state now faces a gap: 'there are concerns of increased incidences of driving while impaired after cannabis use,' the Department of Health said. Senator Liz Krueger, a key architect, stated, 'Revenue from our legalized system will be used to pay these ongoing costs.' The Department of Health seeks new technology to detect cannabis impairment, as no standard test exists. Nearly 400 officers are trained as drug recognition experts, with thousands more in training. Critics warn DWI issues should have been solved before legalization. As enforcement lags, vulnerable road users face greater danger from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
