A yellow taxi made a U-turn and hit her. Seconds later, an SUV struck her again. She died at the hospital. Both drivers stayed. No charges were filed. The street was quiet again, but the loss stayed. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said.</a></p><p>A day before, a Tesla hit a guardrail on the FDR. The car flipped and burned. The driver died. Her passenger survived. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least.

One was a driver. Three people suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not stop. They do not slow.</p><h3 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians. Trucks killed one.</strong> Bikes and mopeds injured, but did not kill. Cars and trucks do most of the damage. The old and the young are not spared. The streets are not safe for anyone who walks, rides, or waits for the light to change.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city says it is working. Speed cameras now run all day. The council passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit has not changed yet. Cameras need Albany to act again, or they will go dark. The city has built more bike lanes and changed some intersections. But the dead are still dead. The injured still limp. The silence from some leaders is louder than the sirens.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets where the old can cross and the young can ride without fear.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
