Eighteen seriously hurt.</strong> In the past twelve months, 417 crashes tore through the streets of Upper East Side-Lenox Hill-Roosevelt Island. Two of the dead were over 75. One was a woman crossing York Avenue at dusk, struck first by a yellow cab making a U-turn, then by an SUV. She died at the hospital. Both drivers stayed. No charges were filed. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said. Moments later, a 35-year-old woman driving a 2023 Chevrolet Trailblazer also struck her, police said.</a></p><p>On the FDR, a Tesla flipped and burned. The driver died. The passenger lived. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, bikes, mopeds</strong>—all have left blood on these streets. But the deadliest wounds come from cars and trucks. In three years, they killed six and left dozens with injuries that will never heal.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city claims progress. They point to new speed cameras, lower speed limits, and intersection redesigns. But on these blocks, the carnage continues. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. Laws allow lower limits, but the city drags its feet. The dead do not wait for policy.</p><p>Local boards and advocates have pushed for safer crossings, split bike and pedestrian paths, and more space for people. The city <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/cyclists-pedestrians-paths-queensboro-bridge/>opened a separate pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge</a> after years of pressure. But every delay is another risk. Every unprotected crossing is a coin toss.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand the citywide 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras, more protected crossings, more space for people, not cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p><p>The numbers are not just numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons. The slow disaster will not stop until leaders feel the heat. Make them feel it.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prosecutors allege Peña was drunk, high, and speeding at 83 mph—three times the limit—when he ran a red light and T-boned 23-year-old Justin Diaz’s car. Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield. The victim, Diaz, was headed to work and had just graduated college.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash injured three people: a 7-year-old girl with a broken femur and head injury, a 14-year-old girl with leg injuries, and a 58-year-old man with bruises. Police arrested Bah and charged her with 'reckless endangerment, reckless driving and driving without a license.'

The chase ended near Dyckman Street when the car slammed into a building and caught fire. The officers 'approached the burning SUV but then left without helping the driver or calling for an ambulance.' They did not report the crash. Both have been suspended while the Force Investigation Division and Attorney General review their actions. The incident follows a February NYPD policy change barring pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' NYPD data shows one in four pursuits last year led to crashes or injuries.
