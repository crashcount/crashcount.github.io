The board, once resistant, now shifts toward safety for riders.</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 8 (CB8) voted 38-3 to request 'fully protected crosstown bike lanes approximately every 10 blocks between 60th and 110th streets on both sides of Central Park, and a two-way protected bikeway around Central Park.' The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition. Now, the board calls for comprehensive, protected infrastructure to shield vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, hosted by State Senator Liz Krueger, featured DOT Manhattan Borough Commissioner Ed Pincar, who said, “We are looking very closely… we may be able to present a proposal maybe even later this year.” The redesign aims to transform Third Avenue into a safer boulevard with fewer car lanes, more bus lanes, a separated bike path, and wider sidewalks. Council Member Gale Brewer and advocates like Paul Krikler have long demanded these changes. Krueger and the NYPD, however, focused on enforcement against cyclists and e-bike riders, citing constituent concerns. Krueger has previously pushed for harsher penalties for electric-vehicle riders. NYPD data shows more enforcement against cyclists than drivers, even though drivers cause most injuries. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to repair any curb deemed a safety hazard during street resurfacing. The matter summary reads: 'requiring that the department of transportation repair broken curbs as part of resurfacing projects.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Schulman, Brewer, Dinowitz, Krishnan, Narcisse, Menin, Yeger, Avilés, Nurse, Gutiérrez, Riley, Brannan, Sanchez, and Louis. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. Broken curbs are a daily threat to pedestrians, especially the elderly and disabled. The bill would have forced the city to address these hazards as part of routine work, but the effort stalled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the City Council, gives the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection power to revoke licenses for deceptive practices. Christopher Marte, another council member, proposed two related bills: one limits delivery backpack weights, the other bans retaliation against workers who refuse unsafe deliveries or miss tight deadlines. Marte’s bill also requires companies promising 15-minute delivery to state that speed is not guaranteed, citing 'the safety of the public and delivery workers.' Menin said, 'These stores are operating in the city in a completely unregulated fashion.' The bills respond to concerns that fast-delivery apps push workers to break traffic laws, endangering pedestrians and cyclists as e-bikes speed through city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Blood stains the pavement.</p><p class=mb3>Council Members Julie Menin and Julie Won are pushing for urgent pedestrian and bike improvements on the Queensboro Bridge. The Department of Transportation (DOT) delayed the conversion of the South Outer Roadway to a full-time pedestrian path until at least the end of 2023, citing ongoing bridge repairs. The shared path, only 11 feet wide, is far below DOT’s own safety standards. Injuries have increased as usage soars—nine cyclists hurt in three years, up from three. Julie Won said, "People walking or biking on the shared path are paying with bloody pavement and broken bones, all so the DOT can promote car travel for the few." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the project is a priority, but the city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed. Nine lanes for cars, half a lane each for people. The danger is real and rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
