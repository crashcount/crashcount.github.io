One seriously injured.</strong> In Laurelton, from 2022 to June 2025, the streets have not been quiet. <strong>602 crashes. 356 people hurt.</strong> The dead do not speak, but their absence is everywhere. A 65-year-old man, struck and killed while walking on Merrick Boulevard. A 33-year-old, thrown from his motorcycle and left lifeless on 125th Avenue. A 27-year-old woman, dead after a car slammed into an underpass on the Belt Parkway. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p><strong>No children died. But children bled.</strong> Eleven under 18 were injured in the last year alone. Most victims were not behind the wheel. They were walking, riding, living. The machines that hurt them were almost always cars and SUVs. The stories repeat: driver inattention, unsafe speed, a moment’s distraction. The cost is always the same.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city has tools. It does not always use them.</strong> Sammy’s Law passed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit in Laurelton is still higher. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders on bringing it back. When a woman died on the Belt Parkway, police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>&ldquo;Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven&rsquo;t figured out who was driving.&rdquo;</a> The system shrugs. The families grieve.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, more lives are risked. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The hearing, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, questioned whether Mayor Adams is honoring his pledge to end road violence. The matter focused on the administration’s failure to meet Council-mandated benchmarks in the NYC Streets Plan, especially protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers stated, 'No New Yorker should have to fear for their life while crossing or using our streets.' She stressed that enforcement alone is not enough, demanding equitable infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods. Advocacy leaders like Elizabeth Adams and Sara Lind echoed the call for physical changes and accountability. The hearing marked a rare moment of scrutiny, with advocates welcoming the Council’s push for real safety measures for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers (District 31) announced a forthcoming NYC Council hearing on obscured license plates and enforcement. The hearing, date not yet set, follows mounting evidence that drivers—including law enforcement—deface or cover plates to evade speed and toll cameras. The matter, described as a public safety issue, exposes a gap in city enforcement. Brooks-Powers’s action responds to calls for accountability, as highlighted in the article: 'there will be a hearing on obscured plates.' Despite City Hall’s claim that 'obscuring and defacing license plates is against the law' and that enforcement is increasing, the streets tell a different story. Unreadable plates let reckless drivers escape detection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—face greater risk. The city’s failure to act leaves them exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing, not yet scheduled, follows months of reporting by Gersh Kuntzman, who documented widespread plate defacement by drivers—including law enforcement and public officials—to evade speed and toll cameras. The article quotes Brooks-Powers: 'there will be a hearing on obscured plates.' Kuntzman urges expansion of Council Member Lincoln Restler’s Intro 501, which would let the public report illegal plates via 311. City Hall claims it is 'strengthening enforcement,' but Kuntzman’s reporting shows little follow-through. The lack of action lets reckless drivers escape accountability, undermining automated enforcement and endangering vulnerable road users. The system’s failure leaves pedestrians and cyclists exposed while drivers hide in plain sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of bollards at reconstructed sidewalks, curb extensions and pedestrian ramps,” was sponsored by Council Members Brooks-Powers, Krishnan (primary), Stevens, Hanif, Hudson, Richardson Jordan, Riley, and the Manhattan Borough President. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install bollards at reconstructed sidewalks, curb extensions, and pedestrian ramps, especially where accessibility upgrades are made. It mandates a study on bollard effectiveness in high pedestrian areas and demands annual reporting on installations and requests. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no enactment. The measure aims to harden pedestrian space, forcing the city to act where cars threaten walkers and wheelchair users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The committee failed to hold the Adams administration accountable for missing protected bike and bus lane benchmarks.
