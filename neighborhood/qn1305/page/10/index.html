One seriously injured.</strong> In Laurelton, from 2022 to June 2025, the streets have not been quiet. <strong>602 crashes. 356 people hurt.</strong> The dead do not speak, but their absence is everywhere. A 65-year-old man, struck and killed while walking on Merrick Boulevard. A 33-year-old, thrown from his motorcycle and left lifeless on 125th Avenue. A 27-year-old woman, dead after a car slammed into an underpass on the Belt Parkway. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p><strong>No children died. But children bled.</strong> Eleven under 18 were injured in the last year alone. Most victims were not behind the wheel. They were walking, riding, living. The machines that hurt them were almost always cars and SUVs. The stories repeat: driver inattention, unsafe speed, a moment’s distraction. The cost is always the same.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city has tools. It does not always use them.</strong> Sammy’s Law passed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit in Laurelton is still higher. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders on bringing it back. When a woman died on the Belt Parkway, police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>&ldquo;Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven&rsquo;t figured out who was driving.&rdquo;</a> The system shrugs. The families grieve.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, more lives are risked. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The session included Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, who supported the measures. The bills, as summarized, would require the Department of Transportation to create pedestrian zones for seniors, install traffic calming devices, increase the frequency of serious crash studies, and implement 'daylighting'—removing parking near intersections—at 100 sites starting January 1, 2025. The matter title reads: 'NYC Council tackles bills on policing, homeless rights and charity gambling.' Narcisse is listed as a sponsor. These actions aim to cut risk for pedestrians and seniors, especially at dangerous crossings. The council’s stance is clear: support for pedestrian safety zones, traffic calming, more crash studies, and daylighting.

This initiative, required by a 2021 City Council law, aims to reduce truck traffic and organize last-mile deliveries. The matter summary states: 'The city will launch a pilot program testing neighborhood delivery microhubs across the five boroughs, aimed at reducing the surge of truck traffic.' Councilmember Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, representing District 31, emphasized the need for sustainable infrastructure to curb environmental justice impacts from truck congestion. The program will allow large trucks to unload at designated hubs, shifting the final delivery leg to vans, cargo bikes, or carts. Details on locations and management are pending. After a year, DOT will review data and consider expansion, with a final report due in 2026. Environmentalists and advocates support the move but note it does not address warehouse siting in vulnerable communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council’s $2.7-billion proposal calls for a near-doubling of Fair Fares funding, $3 million for a battery swap and fire outreach program for delivery workers, and $45.1 million more for road paving. The Council also demands increased investment in street safety infrastructure, especially in communities of color facing high crash rates. Brooks-Powers said, 'New Yorkers deserve access to high-quality services and investments in infrastructure citywide.' Council Member Keith Powers called the battery swap program a 'down payment.' The Council’s push aims to restore cuts and address deadly street conditions.

Twenty-six council members signed on, but Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers did not. Brooks-Powers argued, "Stricter speed limits must also be paired with investments in physical infrastructure as well that deter drivers from going too fast." Advocates, including DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied in support. Despite the push, the Assembly left the measure out of its budget.

The crash happened on North Channel Bridge near Cross Bay Boulevard. The driver stayed at the scene; police made no arrests or summonses. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program (DVAP) requires drivers with 15 speeding tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure, but enforcement is weak. Only a few hundred out of over 20,000 eligible drivers have complied. Queens Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the transportation committee, called for re-examining street safety and road design at the corridor, echoing residents’ demands for safer infrastructure. Advocates, including Families for Safe Streets, urged passage of Sammy’s Law to let NYC set its own speed limits.

The $1.2-billion tax break, meant to spur ten new towers and fund a $20-billion transit overhaul, is under fire. The plan, pitched as a lifeline for Penn Station, now faces doubts about its ability to deliver. State officials admit the project will not fully fund the station. Developer Steve Roth, head of Vornado, is not required to build, putting revenue in doubt. Senator Leroy Comrie called for a reset, saying, “the GPP that’s been presented is not longer working.” Critics, including attorney Chuck Weinstock and policy analyst Rachael Fauss, argue the deal benefits Vornado, not the public. Hundreds of businesses and homes could be lost. The project’s value and feasibility remain in question.
