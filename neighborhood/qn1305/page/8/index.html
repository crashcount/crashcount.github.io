One seriously injured.</strong> In Laurelton, from 2022 to June 2025, the streets have not been quiet. <strong>602 crashes. 356 people hurt.</strong> The dead do not speak, but their absence is everywhere. A 65-year-old man, struck and killed while walking on Merrick Boulevard. A 33-year-old, thrown from his motorcycle and left lifeless on 125th Avenue. A 27-year-old woman, dead after a car slammed into an underpass on the Belt Parkway. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p><strong>No children died. But children bled.</strong> Eleven under 18 were injured in the last year alone. Most victims were not behind the wheel. They were walking, riding, living. The machines that hurt them were almost always cars and SUVs. The stories repeat: driver inattention, unsafe speed, a moment’s distraction. The cost is always the same.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city has tools. It does not always use them.</strong> Sammy’s Law passed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit in Laurelton is still higher. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders on bringing it back. When a woman died on the Belt Parkway, police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>&ldquo;Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven&rsquo;t figured out who was driving.&rdquo;</a> The system shrugs. The families grieve.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, more lives are risked. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction. The council’s action highlights the ongoing danger children face on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s title: 'A Local Law in relation to parking for tractor trailers and other commercial trucks.' It requires the city to identify at least one feasible off-street parking location for tractor trailers in each borough by the end of 2023, and to establish those sites by December 31, 2025. No location can be on a residential street. Council Member Kamillah Hanks sponsored the bill, joined by Brannan, Riley, Dinowitz, Ung, Brooks-Powers, and others. The law aims to clear residential streets of oversized trucks, shifting their presence to designated lots.

The report, reviewed by Council Transportation Chair Selvena N.

Only half completed the course, violations persisted, and just 12 vehicles were seized. Brooks-Powers stated, 'Holding reckless drivers accountable and keeping our streets safe for all New Yorkers remains a priority.' Comptroller Brad Lander criticized DOT for abandoning the effort, urging the city to strengthen, not scrap, DVAP.

The bill required drivers with 15 speed-camera or five red-light tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. Council Member Shahana Hanif voiced disappointment, noting, 'We need to not only reauthorize this program, but strengthen it.' Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data.

She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency.
