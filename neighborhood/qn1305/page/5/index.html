But the numbers do not let you breathe easy. In the past twelve months, there have been 204 crashes. 121 people were hurt. Not one was marked as a serious injury, but pain lingers. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. In the last year, 11 people under 18 were injured in crashes here. The violence is slow, steady, and always waiting.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit-us>The Machines That Hit Us</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. In the last three years, they caused the only pedestrian death in Laurelton. They left 37 people with minor injuries and 10 with moderate injuries. Bikes caused one minor injury. Trucks and buses did not kill or seriously injure anyone, but the threat is always there. The street is not safe for anyone who walks or rides.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-pressure-and-the-need-for-more>Leadership: Promises, Pressure, and the Need for More</h3><p>Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers has called out the city’s failures. “DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results,” she <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>said at a public hearing</a>, demanding real progress on street safety. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored a bill</a> to ban parking near crosswalks and clear sightlines for people on foot. But the pace is slow. Promises pile up. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p>State Senator Leroy Comrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted to extend school speed zones and to require speed limiters for repeat dangerous drivers</a>. These are steps, but the carnage continues. One crash, one injury, is too many.</p><h3 id=the-call-dont-wait-for-blood-on-the-asphalt>The Call: Don’t Wait for Blood on the Asphalt</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day leaders delay, someone else gets hurt. Call your council member. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people who walk and bike.</p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.

The white Toyota sedan hit an underpass near 225th Street around 3:50 a.m. Both occupants were found outside the wreck when police arrived. Investigators are unsure who was driving at the time of impact: 'Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven't figured out who was driving, police said.' The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive. The article highlights ongoing uncertainty about driver identity and underscores the persistent risks on city highways, especially where loss of vehicle control leads to deadly outcomes.

Brooks-Powers</p><p class=mb3>On January 22, 2025, Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confronted the Department of Transportation at a public hearing. She cited DOT's repeated failure to meet the 2019 Streets Master Plan benchmarks—50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles of bus lanes and 25.7 miles of bike lanes. Brooks-Powers introduced Intro 1105, a bill requiring DOT to publish a tracker of its progress. She declared, "DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results." DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione objected, claiming the tracker would add paperwork and reduce community engagement. Brooks-Powers countered, "DOT needs to be more transparent about its project pipeline so we can identify bottlenecks." The committee signaled intent to advance the bill. The city’s failure leaves pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian was crossing without a signal or crosswalk indication when the vehicle's center front end made contact. The pedestrian sustained injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot, described as contusions and bruises, and remained conscious after the impact. The report lists no specific driver contributing factors such as failure to yield or speeding, but notes the pedestrian was crossing without signal. The sedan showed no vehicle damage, and the driver was alone, traveling straight ahead.
