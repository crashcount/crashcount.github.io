One seriously injured.</strong> In Laurelton, from 2022 to June 2025, the streets have not been quiet. <strong>602 crashes. 356 people hurt.</strong> The dead do not speak, but their absence is everywhere. A 65-year-old man, struck and killed while walking on Merrick Boulevard. A 33-year-old, thrown from his motorcycle and left lifeless on 125th Avenue. A 27-year-old woman, dead after a car slammed into an underpass on the Belt Parkway. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p><strong>No children died. But children bled.</strong> Eleven under 18 were injured in the last year alone. Most victims were not behind the wheel. They were walking, riding, living. The machines that hurt them were almost always cars and SUVs. The stories repeat: driver inattention, unsafe speed, a moment’s distraction. The cost is always the same.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city has tools. It does not always use them.</strong> Sammy’s Law passed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit in Laurelton is still higher. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders on bringing it back.

The data, compiled by Transportation Alternatives, showed his Brooklyn district suffered the most traffic injuries citywide in the first half of 2023: 36 pedestrians, 24 cyclists, and 41 motorists. The matter summary reads, 'New York City is on pace for one of the deadliest years for bike riders in recent history, but it doesn't have to be this way.' Restler called on the Adams administration to 'prioritize and expedite proven solutions that will save lives, especially the swift implementation of a truly protected network of bike lanes.' The statement underscores the urgent need for systemic change as vulnerable road users bear the brunt of failed policy and dangerous streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Numbers tell a different story. Arrests for fake plates drop. Summonses barely rise. DOT cameras miss over a million violations. Council weighs tougher fines. Riders and walkers pay the price for weak enforcement.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2023, the City Council held a hearing on NYPD enforcement against ghost cars—vehicles with fake, covered, or defaced plates. NYPD Transportation Bureau’s Michael Pilecki reported arrests for forged plates fell 11 percent from last year, while summonses rose just 0.6 percent. The hearing spotlighted two bills from Council Member Oswald Feliz to raise fines for using or selling fake plates, both widely supported, including by the NYPD. The matter summary: 'NYPD claims it has stepped up its efforts to summons and arrest car drivers who cover or deface their plate, or drive with a fake temporary tag, but its own statistics show that the effort has not continued into this year.' Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable. The city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent.
