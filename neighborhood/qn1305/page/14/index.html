One seriously injured.</strong> In Laurelton, from 2022 to June 2025, the streets have not been quiet. <strong>602 crashes. 356 people hurt.</strong> The dead do not speak, but their absence is everywhere. A 65-year-old man, struck and killed while walking on Merrick Boulevard. A 33-year-old, thrown from his motorcycle and left lifeless on 125th Avenue. A 27-year-old woman, dead after a car slammed into an underpass on the Belt Parkway. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p><strong>No children died. But children bled.</strong> Eleven under 18 were injured in the last year alone. Most victims were not behind the wheel. They were walking, riding, living. The machines that hurt them were almost always cars and SUVs. The stories repeat: driver inattention, unsafe speed, a moment’s distraction. The cost is always the same.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city has tools. It does not always use them.</strong> Sammy’s Law passed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit in Laurelton is still higher. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word from local leaders on bringing it back. When a woman died on the Belt Parkway, police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>&ldquo;Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven&rsquo;t figured out who was driving.&rdquo;</a> The system shrugs. The families grieve.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, more lives are risked. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She questions claims of 750 redesigned intersections. Public data shows far less. Most fixes are signal timing, not real protection. Advocates want proof, not promises. Road deaths remain high. Brewer vows investigation.</p><p class=mb3>On October 5, 2022, Council Member Gale Brewer, chair of the Council's oversight committee, announced plans to investigate the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) street safety claims. Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress. Road deaths remain high, and the city lags on legal mandates for bus and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The first phase includes $5 million for environmental review and $30 million for the Metropolitan Hub. The matter summary states: 'converting a defunct LIRR branch into a Highline-style park in Queens.' Council Member Lynn Schulman supports the park, calling it 'shovel-ready.' Borough President Donovan Richards and Assembly Members Jenifer Rajkumar and David Weprin back both the park and the QueensLink transit proposal. Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation. The debate continues over whether the right-of-way should serve parks, transit, or both.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.' The redesign targets a stretch with 222 crashes and 87 injuries since 2019, aiming to end the long-standing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She did not respond to requests for comment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Asphalt traps water. Storms turn roads into rivers. Bioswales and trees soak up rain, protect homes, keep subways dry. The city must swap pavement for life. Action saves lives, not parking.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2022, the Council Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, discussed flood prevention. An opinion from a Transportation Alternatives staffer urged the Council to 'transform impervious driving lanes into green climate solutions.' The piece calls for bioswales and greenspace in place of parking, citing the deadly floods after Hurricane Ida. It highlights that 72 percent of city land is impervious, worsening flash floods. The author presses city leaders, including Mayor Eric Adams, to repurpose street space for climate resilience, referencing the NYC 25x25 challenge. The message is clear: 'Our streets can become the solution to climate change and flooding.' No council vote occurred, but the advocacy pushes for urgent, systemic change to protect New Yorkers from future storms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seniors get top priority. Non-NYCHA emergencies still jump the queue. The bill died at session’s end. Broken walks remain. Vulnerable tenants wait. Streets stay rough. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0604-2022 was introduced on August 11, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to 'establish priority for sidewalk repairs at developments operated by the New York City Housing Authority,' giving first priority to senior-only NYCHA buildings, then to other NYCHA sites. Emergencies at non-NYCHA properties could override this order, with required notification to local officials. The bill required DOT to report on completed and pending NYCHA sidewalk repairs by June 30, 2023. Council Member Alexa Avilés sponsored the bill, joined by Abreu, Brooks-Powers, Restler, Hanif, Won, Nurse, Gutiérrez, and Sanchez. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without enactment. Sidewalk hazards at NYCHA developments persist, leaving vulnerable residents exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
