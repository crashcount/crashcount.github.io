They are the result of choices. Choices made by leaders, or not made at all. If you want change, you must demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the DOT. Tell them to lower the speed limit, add cameras, and fix the streets. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now.

Streets grow less safe for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 7785, titled 'Relates to bus operation-related traffic regulations,' passed the Senate and Assembly in June 2025. The measure, sponsored by Senator Jamaal Bailey, excludes violations in cooperative housing developments with at least 10,000 Mitchell-Lama units from bus operation traffic regulations. The bill advanced through committee and received broad support in both chambers. By exempting these large complexes, the law weakens traffic enforcement where thousands live. This move increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, stripping away protections that save lives.
