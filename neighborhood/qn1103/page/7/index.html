Three serious injuries. Over 320 hurt.</strong> These are not numbers. They are lives changed in Douglaston-Little Neck since 2022. The pain does not make the news. It sits in hospital rooms and quiet kitchens. In the last twelve months, <strong>101 people were injured</strong> in 195 crashes. No one died this year. But the luck will not hold.</p><h3 id=the-most-vulnerable-still-bleed>The Most Vulnerable Still Bleed</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and children are not spared.</strong> In the last year, eight kids were hurt in crashes here. A 68-year-old man crossing at Westmoreland Street was struck by an SUV. He left the scene with a bleeding head. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Data shows</a> SUVs, sedans, and trucks all played their part. The street does not care who you are. It only cares that you are in the way.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They count intersection redesigns and new speed limits. But in Douglaston-Little Neck, the danger remains. <strong>No new local laws. No bold moves.</strong> The council and community board have not led. They have not fought for more cameras, lower speeds, or safer crossings. The silence is loud. Each day without action is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Crashes are not weather. They are the result of choices. Choices made by leaders, or not made at all. If you want change, you must demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the DOT. Tell them to lower the speed limit, add cameras, and fix the streets. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now. Demand safer streets before another family pays the price.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Ben Turner, a Bayside resident, challenges Council Member Vickie Paladino’s opposition, arguing she misrepresents her district. Turner writes, 'Congestion pricing is a step in the right direction for northeastern Queens.' He claims most commuters use public transit, while drivers into Manhattan are wealthier. Turner highlights the toll of car dominance: traffic, slow buses, pedestrian fatalities, and childhood asthma. He insists that reducing car use will free up space, improve safety, and boost quality of life.

Adams argued, “MTA is a statewide obligation. We’re doing our share.” State lawmakers, including Assembly Member Ed Braunstein and State Senator Liz Krueger, countered that the city should help. Hochul’s budget would shift more costs—like Access-A-Ride and student Metrocards—to the city. Progressive lawmakers suggested taxing the wealthy and freezing fares. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins warned, “To increase fares would be detrimental.” The debate continues as the legislature drafts its own budget.

The resolution calls for a statewide ballot. Sponsors cite risks to outer-borough communities and doubt traffic will drop. The measure is filed, not enacted. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0419-2022, filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, urges the New York State Legislature to require a statewide ballot proposal before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s congestion pricing plan—known as the Central Business District Tolling Program—can proceed. Introduced December 7, 2022, and filed at session’s end, the resolution states: “calls upon the New York State Legislature to amend state law to make implementation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s congestion pricing plan... subject to a statewide ballot proposal.” Council Member Kamillah Hanks led sponsorship, joined by Borelli, Carr, Louis, Yeger, Ariola, and Paladino. The sponsors raise concerns about pollution, health, and traffic impacts on outer-borough communities. The measure questions whether congestion pricing will cut traffic or fund transit improvements. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users is assessed. The bill remains filed, with no further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
