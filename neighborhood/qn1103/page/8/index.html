Three serious injuries. Over 320 hurt.</strong> These are not numbers. They are lives changed in Douglaston-Little Neck since 2022. The pain does not make the news. It sits in hospital rooms and quiet kitchens. In the last twelve months, <strong>101 people were injured</strong> in 195 crashes. No one died this year. But the luck will not hold.</p><h3 id=the-most-vulnerable-still-bleed>The Most Vulnerable Still Bleed</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and children are not spared.</strong> In the last year, eight kids were hurt in crashes here. A 68-year-old man crossing at Westmoreland Street was struck by an SUV. He left the scene with a bleeding head. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Data shows</a> SUVs, sedans, and trucks all played their part. The street does not care who you are. It only cares that you are in the way.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They count intersection redesigns and new speed limits. But in Douglaston-Little Neck, the danger remains. <strong>No new local laws. No bold moves.</strong> The council and community board have not led. They have not fought for more cameras, lower speeds, or safer crossings. The silence is loud. Each day without action is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Crashes are not weather. They are the result of choices. Choices made by leaders, or not made at all. If you want change, you must demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the DOT. Tell them to lower the speed limit, add cameras, and fix the streets. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now. Demand safer streets before another family pays the price.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill died. Utility and oil trucks kept their curb. Pedestrians and families still dodge hulking vehicles at dawn. The city blinked. The danger stayed.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0053-2022, introduced on February 24, 2022, sought to amend city law to bar commercial vehicles from parking overnight on residential streets, between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure handled the bill. The measure removed exemptions for gas, oil, and utility trucks. The matter summary reads: 'This bill would prohibit the parking of commercial vehicles owned or operated by gas or oil heat suppliers, gas or oil heat systems maintenance companies or any public utility in residential streets overnight.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Vickie Paladino, and Kevin C. Riley backed the bill. The council filed it at session’s end, on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst weighed in, but the bill’s failure means residential streets remain lined with large trucks, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
