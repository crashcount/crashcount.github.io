Four seriously hurt.</strong> In Hamilton Heights-Sugar Hill, from 2022 to June 2025, the toll is steady and grim. <strong>Over 500 people injured</strong> in just three and a half years. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs and quiet rooms.</p><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, bikes, vans.</strong> The machines change, the outcome does not. A cyclist struck by an SUV on St. Nicholas Avenue. A pedestrian killed at Riverside Drive. A moped rider left bleeding on W 145th. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people who did not come home.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>City leaders say the right things. They promise safer streets. They pass laws. But the work is slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed in Albany, letting the city lower speed limits. The city can act now. It has not. The clock runs. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% where installed. Injuries drop 14%.</strong> But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Each year, advocates must fight to keep them alive. Each year, the city hesitates. The cost is paid in blood.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A family gets a bill for a police car after their son is killed. The city calls it policy. The family calls it cruelty. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/23/dirt-bikers-family-demands-attorney-general-charge-nypd-cop-deadly-uptown-collision/>Daily News reports</a> the NYPD has no comment. The silence is heavy.</p><blockquote><p>“Williams&rsquo; family is suing the NYPD and demanding criminal charges against the officer, identified as Perez.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/23/dirt-bikers-family-demands-attorney-general-charge-nypd-cop-deadly-uptown-collision/>NY Daily News</a></p></blockquote><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Lower the speed limit.

The driver was wearing a lap belt and harness and complained of pain or nausea. The report cites 'Other Vehicular' contributing factors multiple times, indicating driver errors related to vehicle operation. One sedan was traveling south going straight ahead with center front end impact and damage, while the other sedan was parked with center back end impact and damage.

Council members question why a company with such a record still hauls trash in city zones. The city’s new waste program promises stricter oversight, but danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2024, the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) appointed an independent monitor for Cogent Waste Solutions, a private carting firm with a deadly safety record. The move comes before the city’s new Commercial Waste Zone program launches this fall. Council Members Shaun Abreu and Sandy Nurse raised alarms, asking, 'how the city awarded a contract to a company with a history of endangering workers to begin with.' Cogent’s trucks have killed one, injured four, and racked up hundreds of violations. Despite this, DSNY allowed Cogent to win contracts in four waste zones. DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.' The oversight hearing exposes a system that lets reckless firms operate, even as new rules loom.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the City Council, would require apps to let customers tip at checkout and set a minimum gratuity suggestion of 10%. The measure responds to recent app changes that made tipping harder, slashing delivery workers’ earnings. Abreu called it 'the most common sense bill for not only Deliveristas but consumers.' The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection stated it does not endorse the app companies’ decisions and will review the legislation. Abreu is also working on a pay transparency bill.

Access denied.</p><p class=mb3>This debate centers on Columbia University’s refusal to pay for elevators at the 125th Street 1 train station, despite its West Harlem campus expansion. The project is not a council bill but a protracted standoff, with the MTA and local officials pressing Columbia to fund full ADA accessibility. The university will pay to widen escalators but insists public funds should cover elevators, citing project approval before the Zoning for Accessibility law (October 2021). Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine calls elevator access 'the top priority among station accessibility projects in the borough.' Assembly Member Daniel O’Donnell’s office slams Columbia’s lack of transparency and urges investment, noting the school’s $13-billion endowment and $179 million in tax breaks. Students and disabled riders face daily hardship. The MTA, Council Member Shaun Abreu, and advocates push for progress, but Columbia stalls. No elevator, no access. Vulnerable users remain shut out.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
