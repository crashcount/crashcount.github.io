The blood doesn’t.</h1></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Hamilton Heights-Sugar Hill: Jan 1, 2022 - Sep 3, 2025</h2><p>A man on a bike went down at W 155th and St. Nicholas just before 11 PM on Nov 2, 2024. An SUV hit him. The record lists driver inattention and unsafe speed. He died (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>3 people killed</strong> in Hamilton Heights–Sugar Hill since Jan 1, 2022. In that same span, <strong>572 people were injured</strong> in 1,199 crashes here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>The city already said why speed matters. “The city&rsquo;s ability to control the speed limits on its streets plays a crucial role in delivering traffic safety,” said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez last year (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/24/city-council-poised-to-pass-home-rule-message-for-sammys-law-on-thursday>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=nights-take-the-worst>Nights take the worst</h3><p>The deaths here stack up after dark. The deadliest hours cluster at <strong>2 AM</strong> and <strong>10 PM</strong> in this neighborhood’s crash log (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>Speed shows up. So does distraction. “Unsafe Speed” appears as a factor alongside “Driver Inattention/Distraction” in local injury records, including the W 155th fatal crash and other cases logged on Amsterdam and Broadway (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>A second death sits on Riverside Drive near W 147th. A pedestrian was struck at about 2:42 AM on Sep 4, 2022. He did not survive (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><h3 id=corners-that-dont-forgive>Corners that don’t forgive</h3><p>Crashes pile up on the long, fast runs: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Henry Hudson Parkway</a>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Amsterdam Avenue</a>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>West 145th Street</a>. The city’s own entries tie injuries here to speed and inattention—things design can blunt and enforcement can catch (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>Simple fixes exist: daylight the crosswalks so drivers can see; harden left turns; give people a head start on the signal. Council Member Shaun Abreu co‑sponsors a bill to ban parking at crosswalks to open sightlines (<a href=#>Int 1138‑2024</a> noted in Council records). Use it. Aim it at these blocks.</p><h3 id=hold-the-line-on-speed>Hold the line on speed</h3><p>Albany handed New York City the tool to set safer limits. The city’s own leaders backed it. “The city&rsquo;s ability to control the speed limits on its streets plays a crucial role in delivering traffic safety,” said DOT’s Rodriguez when the Council advanced the home‑rule message for Sammy’s Law (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/24/city-council-poised-to-pass-home-rule-message-for-sammys-law-on-thursday>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The charge now is simple: make 20 the norm on residential streets. Start on Amsterdam and 145th. Then keep going.</p><p>There’s another lever for the worst repeat offenders. In Albany, the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong> would require speed‑limiting tech for drivers who rack up offenses. State Senator <a href=/senate-district/30/>Cordell Cleare</a> co‑sponsored and voted yes in committee on the Senate bill <strong>S 4045</strong> in June 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/71/>Al Taylor</a> co‑sponsors the Assembly version <strong>A 2299</strong> (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States</a>).</p><h3 id=your-block-their-choices>Your block, their choices</h3><p>This neighborhood’s log shows a steady harm: bikes and people on foot struck by cars and SUVs, late at night, on fast corridors. The tools sit on the table: open the corners, lower the limit, rein in repeat speeders. Council Member <a href=/council-district/7/>Shaun Abreu</a>. Senator <a href=/senate-district/30/>Cordell Cleare</a>. Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/71/>Al Taylor</a>. They have the files and the votes on record. The next move is to use them on your street.</p><p>A man on a bike died at W 155th and St. Nicholas. Don’t wait for another siren. Take one step today. Ask City Hall and Albany to act.

Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.'
