An SUV hit him. The record lists driver inattention and unsafe speed. He died (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>3 people killed</strong> in Hamilton Heights–Sugar Hill since Jan 1, 2022. In that same span, <strong>572 people were injured</strong> in 1,199 crashes here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>The city already said why speed matters. “The city&rsquo;s ability to control the speed limits on its streets plays a crucial role in delivering traffic safety,” said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez last year (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/24/city-council-poised-to-pass-home-rule-message-for-sammys-law-on-thursday>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=nights-take-the-worst>Nights take the worst</h3><p>The deaths here stack up after dark.

So does distraction. “Unsafe Speed” appears as a factor alongside “Driver Inattention/Distraction” in local injury records, including the W 155th fatal crash and other cases logged on Amsterdam and Broadway (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>A second death sits on Riverside Drive near W 147th.

Council Member Shaun Abreu co‑sponsors a bill to ban parking at crosswalks to open sightlines (<a href=#>Int 1138‑2024</a> noted in Council records). Use it. Aim it at these blocks.</p><h3 id=hold-the-line-on-speed>Hold the line on speed</h3><p>Albany handed New York City the tool to set safer limits. The city’s own leaders backed it. “The city&rsquo;s ability to control the speed limits on its streets plays a crucial role in delivering traffic safety,” said DOT’s Rodriguez when the Council advanced the home‑rule message for Sammy’s Law (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/24/city-council-poised-to-pass-home-rule-message-for-sammys-law-on-thursday>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The charge now is simple: make 20 the norm on residential streets. Start on Amsterdam and 145th. Then keep going.</p><p>There’s another lever for the worst repeat offenders. In Albany, the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong> would require speed‑limiting tech for drivers who rack up offenses. State Senator <a href=/senate-district/30/>Cordell Cleare</a> co‑sponsored and voted yes in committee on the Senate bill <strong>S 4045</strong> in June 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/71/>Al Taylor</a> co‑sponsors the Assembly version <strong>A 2299</strong> (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States</a>).</p><h3 id=your-block-their-choices>Your block, their choices</h3><p>This neighborhood’s log shows a steady harm: bikes and people on foot struck by cars and SUVs, late at night, on fast corridors. The tools sit on the table: open the corners, lower the limit, rein in repeat speeders. Council Member <a href=/council-district/7/>Shaun Abreu</a>. Senator <a href=/senate-district/30/>Cordell Cleare</a>. Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/71/>Al Taylor</a>. They have the files and the votes on record.

Disabled riders face long detours. Politicians and students demand action. The university’s $13-billion endowment stays untouched. Public money must fill the gap. Progress stalls. Riders wait. Access denied.</p><p class=mb3>This debate centers on Columbia University’s refusal to pay for elevators at the 125th Street 1 train station, despite its West Harlem campus expansion. The project is not a council bill but a protracted standoff, with the MTA and local officials pressing Columbia to fund full ADA accessibility. The university will pay to widen escalators but insists public funds should cover elevators, citing project approval before the Zoning for Accessibility law (October 2021). Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine calls elevator access 'the top priority among station accessibility projects in the borough.' Assembly Member Daniel O’Donnell’s office slams Columbia’s lack of transparency and urges investment, noting the school’s $13-billion endowment and $179 million in tax breaks. Students and disabled riders face daily hardship. The MTA, Council Member Shaun Abreu, and advocates push for progress, but Columbia stalls. No elevator, no access. Vulnerable users remain shut out.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian sustained a severe injury described as a fractured, distorted, and dislocated upper arm/shoulder. The report identifies 'View Obstructed/Limited' as a contributing factor, indicating the driver's limited visibility played a critical role in the crash. The point of impact was the vehicle's left front bumper. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally, but the failure to ensure a clear view before turning led to the collision. The pedestrian was conscious and injured but was not cited with any contributing factors.
