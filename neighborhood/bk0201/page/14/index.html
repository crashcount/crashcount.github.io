Three seriously hurt. In Brooklyn Heights, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, traffic violence has left 2 people dead and 3 with life-changing injuries. In the last year alone, 75 people were hurt in 207 crashes. No one under 18 died, but the young are not spared. One child was injured. The streets do not forgive.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. They broke bones and ended lives. Trucks and vans followed close behind. A sedan hit a 23-year-old man crossing near Court Street. He walked away with an abrasion. He was lucky. Others were not. On Furman Street, a Cadillac SUV slammed into a car. A 76-year-old woman died. The driver was trapped, incoherent, and survived. The city moved on. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Speed kills. In February 2025, a drunk driver tore through Atlantic Avenue at 72 mph. He ran a red light and killed Katherine Harris, 31, steps from her home. Her mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/drunk-driver-who-killed-pedestrian-while-driving-72-mph-in-brooklyn-sentenced-to-3-to-9-years/>said, &ldquo;I lost part of me.&rdquo;</a> The driver got three to nine years. The street got nothing.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-silence>Leaders: Action and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has pushed for change. He co-sponsored bills to speed up protected bike lanes, ban parking near crosswalks, and mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders. State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/24/hochul-signs-speed-camera-bill-citing-streetsblogs-coverage-of-unsafe-school-streets>led the charge</a> to expand speed cameras and crack down on drivers who hide their plates. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon backed bills to fine bike lane blockers and force speed-limiting tech on repeat speeders. But most bills are still waiting. The SAFE Streets Act <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>sits in committee</a>. The dead keep waiting too.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-is-not-done>What Next? The Work Is Not Done</h3><p>Every delay is another risk. The city could lower speed limits to 20 mph. It could pass the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>. It could daylight every crosswalk. It could build real protection for people on foot and bike. But it has not. Not yet.</p><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand action.

The project, led by the Department of Transportation, aimed to create a protected bike lane from the Manhattan Bridge to Barclays Center. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso said, "New York City is regressing on meeting its Vision Zero goals ... and stalled street safety improvements, like those slated for Ashland Place, are a part of the reason why." State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety. City Hall deflected, blaming e-bikes for rising cyclist deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Transportation Committee, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a final report on the program’s effectiveness. The bill required drivers with 15 speed-camera or five red-light tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. Council Member Shahana Hanif voiced disappointment, noting, 'We need to not only reauthorize this program, but strengthen it.' Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data. The lack of enforcement leaves dangerous drivers on the road and vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA had announced service upgrades, but later changed its press release, citing F line track work as the cause for delay—work unrelated to the R train. Gounardes, who fought for MTA funding in Albany, accused the agency of misrepresenting the improvements, saying, 'I’m shocked and frustrated that the MTA would misrepresent these service upgrades to the riding public.' Transit advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance echoed calls for honesty: 'Public transit shouldn’t be a rollercoaster of mismatched expectations.'
