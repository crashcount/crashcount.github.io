The numbers do not lie. <strong>213 people injured, 2 killed, 3 left with life-altering wounds</strong> since 2022. The dead do not speak. The injured limp, or do not walk at all.

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 21, 2022, the League of American Bicyclists released a report ranking New York State 13th in bike friendliness, but giving it an F+ for traffic laws and practices. The report criticized the absence of a defined safe passing distance for motorists overtaking cyclists, the lack of local control over speed limits, and poor public reporting on police stops. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called the grade unacceptable, urging passage of his road-sharing training bill and support for Sen. Brad Hoylman’s bill to lower speed limits. Gounardes also pushed to keep speed cameras active. Advocates like Jon Orcutt acknowledged progress, such as the MTA’s bike strategy and new greenway funding, but stressed the need for stronger laws. The League’s summary: 'New York received high marks for infrastructure and funding, and education and encouragement, but got an F+ in traffic laws and practices.' The state’s failure to protect cyclists and pedestrians leaves vulnerable road users exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 84th Precinct in Downtown Brooklyn was named the worst offender, with officers racking up speeding tickets, blocking hydrants, and abusing placards. Council Member Lincoln Restler, who represents the area, condemned the precinct’s behavior as 'petty, but pervasive corruption' and pledged to push for aggressive legislation and enforcement. Restler has previously called for eliminating parking placards entirely. Streetsblog’s study found that precinct blocks see more crashes than nearby streets, linking NYPD misconduct to increased danger for vulnerable road users. The issue is framed as a threat to public safety and neighborhood respect.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill was proposed on March 29, 2022. It is currently under consideration in committee. The measure’s summary states it would mandate 'directed training with a professional.' Gounardes called out the current system, linking lack of experience to crashes and road violence. Carroll said professional training means better drivers. The bill has backing from the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools and the city Department of Transportation. Both stress the need for real training to protect all road users. The DMV has not commented. The bill aims to close deadly gaps in driver preparation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event spotlighted the city’s struggle to control its own traffic laws. Adams slammed state rules that force red light and speed cameras off between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., calling it 'unbelievable.' He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year. The mayor pressed for 24/7 camera operation and renewed NYPD focus.

The matter, highlighted in the annual March (Parking) Madness contest, compared the 84th and 69th Precincts for their illegal parking practices. Restler said, "Placard permit holders and users of fake placards park illegally every day and it's simply the status quo." He noted, "These cars obstruct pedestrian space, endanger cyclists, and undermine safety on our streets." Restler supports legislation to reduce placard issuance and the creation of an independent enforcement unit outside the NYPD. Between January 2017 and February 2022, the 84th Precinct area saw 219 crashes injuring cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists. Police cars often took over sidewalks despite having two parking lots. The statement underscores how unchecked police parking endangers vulnerable road users and blocks safe passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver.
