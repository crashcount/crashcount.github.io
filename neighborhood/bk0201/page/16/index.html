Gounardes and Assembly Member Gallagher push a bill to force repeat speeders to install limiters. The tech would cap speed, targeting drivers with six or more tickets. Advocates say it could cut deaths. Reckless drivers face real consequences.</p><p class=mb3>On August 2, 2023, State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher announced new legislation targeting recidivist reckless drivers. The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes and Assembly Member Gallagher push a bill to force repeat speeders to install limiters. The tech would cap speed, targeting drivers with six or more tickets. Advocates say it could cut deaths. Reckless drivers face real consequences.</p><p class=mb3>On August 2, 2023, State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher announced new legislation targeting recidivist reckless drivers. The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, targets drivers with six or more automated speed or red light tickets, or eleven license points in 18 months. The measure would force these drivers to install devices that cap speed at five miles per hour above the limit. Gounardes said, 'There is a persistent cohort of drivers... driving on our streets recklessly without any consequences.' The bill was unveiled at the site of a fatal pedestrian crash in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which mandates safety courses for repeat offenders, has faced criticism for weak enforcement. This new bill seeks to close those gaps and directly slow down the most dangerous drivers on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler, whose district covers DUMBO, Greenpoint, and Brooklyn Heights, expressed reluctance to push for stricter enforcement, noting that many scooter riders are deliveristas pressured by food delivery apps. Cyclists described collisions, injuries, and a lack of NYPD action. One cyclist, Shari Stadel, suffered a concussion and stitches after a crash with scooters on the Manhattan Bridge. Cyclists and witnesses questioned why laws are not enforced. The debate highlighted a growing danger for vulnerable road users, with enforcement lagging behind the surge in high-speed vehicles on narrow bridge paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to amend city code by setting penalties for alternate side parking violations at $65 for a first offense and $100 for each subsequent offense within a 12-month period. After three violations in a year, the vehicle would be towed if found in violation again. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing penalties for alternate side parking violations and requiring towing of certain vehicles in violation of alternate side parking rules.' Council Members Erik D. Bottcher (primary sponsor) and Lincoln Restler (co-sponsor) led the effort. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023.

The meeting, billed as an 'awareness town hall,' was dominated by opponents, including Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte-Hermelyn and business leaders like Tony Argento of Broadway Stages. Bichotte-Hermelyn, whose district is far from the site, admitted limited knowledge of the plan but cited business concerns. The session excluded supporters of the redesign, who rallied outside. The Department of Transportation defended its proposal to reduce lanes and add parking-protected bike lanes, citing proven safety benefits. Council Member Lincoln Restler and activists later rallied for the overhaul, insisting that safety for all road users must not be compromised. The event highlighted deep divisions and the influence of business interests over street safety reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
