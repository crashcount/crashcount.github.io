Three seriously hurt. In Brooklyn Heights, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, traffic violence has left 2 people dead and 3 with life-changing injuries. In the last year alone, 75 people were hurt in 207 crashes. No one under 18 died, but the young are not spared. One child was injured. The streets do not forgive.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. They broke bones and ended lives. Trucks and vans followed close behind. A sedan hit a 23-year-old man crossing near Court Street. He walked away with an abrasion. He was lucky. Others were not. On Furman Street, a Cadillac SUV slammed into a car. A 76-year-old woman died. The driver was trapped, incoherent, and survived. The city moved on. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Speed kills. In February 2025, a drunk driver tore through Atlantic Avenue at 72 mph. He ran a red light and killed Katherine Harris, 31, steps from her home. Her mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/drunk-driver-who-killed-pedestrian-while-driving-72-mph-in-brooklyn-sentenced-to-3-to-9-years/>said, &ldquo;I lost part of me.&rdquo;</a> The driver got three to nine years. The street got nothing.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-silence>Leaders: Action and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has pushed for change. He co-sponsored bills to speed up protected bike lanes, ban parking near crosswalks, and mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders. State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/24/hochul-signs-speed-camera-bill-citing-streetsblogs-coverage-of-unsafe-school-streets>led the charge</a> to expand speed cameras and crack down on drivers who hide their plates. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon backed bills to fine bike lane blockers and force speed-limiting tech on repeat speeders. But most bills are still waiting. The SAFE Streets Act <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>sits in committee</a>. The dead keep waiting too.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-is-not-done>What Next? The Work Is Not Done</h3><p>Every delay is another risk. The city could lower speed limits to 20 mph. It could pass the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>. It could daylight every crosswalk. It could build real protection for people on foot and bike. But it has not. Not yet.</p><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand action.

The bill, stalled for years in Albany, gained urgency after a fatal Brooklyn crash on April 1, 2025. Gallagher, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes and city Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied at Borough Hall, urging swift passage. The bill targets drivers with 11 or more license points in 24 months, or six camera violations in a year. Gallagher said, 'A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.' Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.' The legislation mirrors past efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act, aiming to hold reckless drivers accountable and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, blame Albany’s delay in passing Senator Andrew Gounardes’s bill to require speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders. Furnas said, “If Albany had passed this bill when it was first introduced, this vehicle would already have been speed limited and this crash would never have happened.” The bill remains pending.

The agency used powers from Sammy's Law, passed last year, to lower speeds in DUMBO (Brooklyn), City Island (Bronx), Broad Channel (Queens), and New Brighton (Staten Island). DOT chose these areas for their heavy pedestrian traffic and clear boundaries. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing DUMBO, praised the move, saying, "I'm pleased that DOT will be implementing Brooklyn's first Regional Slow Zone in DUMBO—a neighborhood densely crowded with pedestrian foot traffic." DOT plans to cut speeds on 250 street segments this year, focusing on schools and shared streets. Research shows lower speed limits reduce injury severity in crashes. Despite this progress, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not brought a citywide 20 mph limit to a vote. Advocates urge more action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The session reviewed how the new toll for driving below 60th Street cut traffic and boosted bus speeds. MTA Transit President Demetrius Crichlow told council members, “Every single crossing that gets into Manhattan has seen an improvement, some lines as much as seven to 10 minutes improved speeds.” Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) said, “It sounds like there may be opportunities for us to increase service as the result of more efficient travel times.” The MTA is piloting schedule changes on seven bus lines. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called the changes “exactly what it was supposed to do.” Bus riders, pedestrians, and the city’s economy all benefit. No evidence shows traffic shifting to other boroughs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds.
