The numbers do not lie. <strong>213 people injured, 2 killed, 3 left with life-altering wounds</strong> since 2022. The dead do not speak. The injured limp, or do not walk at all.

The bill, discussed in oversight hearings, remains stalled. The matter summary states: 'Noise complaints from helicopters over New York City have soared in recent years, but lawmakers at city, state, and federal levels have failed to significantly reduce non-essential helicopter flights.' Restler declared, 'This isn't just a quality of life issue — it's about climate justice. 1 helicopter idling is the equivalent of 40 cars!' Council Member Gale Brewer and State Senator Brad Hoylman joined calls for action. Despite advocacy and testimony from residents, significant policy changes have not passed. The Federal Aviation Administration’s authority blocks local control.

Pedestrians dodge cars. Buses crawl. Locals demand order. Council Member Restler secured $600,000. DOT and EDC will lead. No car ban planned. Streets remain dangerous. The study aims to find answers. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 14, 2022, the city announced a traffic study for DUMBO, Brooklyn, a move long demanded by residents. The study, funded with $600,000 secured by Council Member Lincoln Restler, will be conducted by the Department of Transportation and the Economic Development Corporation. The effort follows years of rising congestion and danger for pedestrians between the Brooklyn Bridge and Navy Yard. The official matter: 'investigate how the congested Brooklyn waterfront neighborhood could be safer for pedestrians and improve mobility.' Restler said, 'It’s a moment for us to pause and think and plan how to move pedestrian and vehicular traffic much safer.' Locals like Mallory Kasdan called for more stop signs and enforcement. Despite some calls for pedestrianization, the study will not consider a full car ban. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno said, 'We are excited about the possibilities to enhance pedestrian safety and improve mobility.' The study’s outcome could reshape DUMBO’s streets, but for now, danger persists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, the bill is advancing in the City Council with 24 out of 51 members signed on as of November 7, 2022. It sits with the Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, who is working with Restler to streamline the complaint process. The bill’s summary: it allows residents to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or fire hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school, creating a $175 fine and a civilian complaint protocol. Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation. The NYPD and DOT oppose the bill, citing concerns about neighbor conflict. Advocates support it, highlighting NYPD’s failure to protect vulnerable road users. The bill is seen as a major improvement over the ineffective 311 system.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It also mandated a Department of Transportation guide for collision victims, outlining rights to police reports and insurance information. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to resources for victims of motor vehicle collisions.' Council Members Farah N.
