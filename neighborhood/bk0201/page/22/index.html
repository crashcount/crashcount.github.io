But the numbers do not comfort. The streets still bleed. In the last three years, people have been crushed, trapped, and left with broken limbs. A 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of an SUV on Furman Street. The driver was speeding. She was trapped, incoherent, and then gone. The man behind the wheel survived, but not unscathed. The street did not forgive either of them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 27-year-old woman crossing with the signal at Tillary and Cadman Plaza West was hit by a turning sedan.

He was emerging from behind a parked car. The city calls it an abrasion. The city does not count the fear.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-bills-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Bills, and the Waiting</h2><p>Local leaders have written bills. Council Member Restler has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>sponsored laws</a> to speed up protected bike lanes, ban parking near crosswalks, and mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders.

The street does not wait.</p><p>State Senator Gounardes has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>pushed for speed cameras and speed limiters</a>.

The goal: clear streets, protect lives.</p><p class=mb3>Intro. 501, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler of District 33, was debated on December 9, 2022. The bill sits before the council, aiming to let civilians report illegal parking in bike lanes, bus lanes, and near hydrants within 1,320 feet of schools. The matter summary reads: 'The point of Intro 501 is to effectively deter dangerous parking that block bike lanes, bus lanes and sidewalks – not to generate revenue.' Restler calls illegal parking and placard abuse a public safety risk, saying, 'These cars illegally obstruct pedestrian space, endanger cyclists, and block accessibility.' The bill proposes a $175 penalty, with 25% paid to the reporting civilian. While some question civilian enforcement, Restler insists the measure targets safety, not profit.

The bill is under City Council review as of December 6, 2022. The matter summary reads: 'A proposed City Council bill would let civilians report cars illegally and unsafely parked in crosswalks and bike lanes and then collect 25 percent of the resulting ticket fees.' Restler is the lead sponsor. In a published opinion, critics argue the bill creates conflict, erodes trust, and places the burden of enforcement on vulnerable road users. The statement warns, 'By devolving responsibility for street safety to cyclists and pedestrians, Restler abdicates the role of government and places the burden—and by extension, the blame—back on the victims.' The piece calls for systemic design changes, not citizen-led enforcement, to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill draws fire in a December 6, 2022 Streetsblog opinion, which warns, 'turning citizens against one another, even in the name of pedestrian safety, is a terrible mistake.' The writer opposes both citizen and NYPD enforcement, urging proven street design instead. The piece notes, 'Bills like Intro 501 further the trend toward mutual mistrust... by creating a narc economy.' Restler and co-sponsors are criticized for supporting increased NYPD budgets while sidestepping systemic solutions. The bill’s intent is clear: empower vulnerable road users.

The law demands annual updates and public engagement. It aims to carve out safe, car-free corridors for walkers and cyclists. The mayor returned it unsigned.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0291-2022, now Local Law 115 of 2022, was enacted by the City Council on November 27, 2022. The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, organized by the Department of Transportation, aimed to gather community feedback on the deteriorating structure. The city promised a new concept by spring 2023 and construction by mid-2026. Restler criticized the process, saying, 'this community will not accept a status quo repair of a Robert Moses relic. We need a bold 21st century climate-oriented solution.' Residents echoed his frustration, pushing for innovative ideas like a ground-level roadway covered by parkland or a tunnel for trucks. The meeting lacked a public Q&amp;A, fueling skepticism about genuine engagement. The city pledged more meetings and collaboration as plans develop.
