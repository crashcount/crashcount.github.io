The numbers do not lie. <strong>213 people injured, 2 killed, 3 left with life-altering wounds</strong> since 2022. The dead do not speak. The injured limp, or do not walk at all.

The Department of Transportation opposes this measure. The incident, reported August 5, 2022, highlights weak NYPD enforcement against placard abuse and illegal plate covers. The matter centers on a car parked in a federal zone with obscured plates, a violation of state law. NYPD agents hesitated to act, citing placard status and unclear jurisdiction, but issued a $65 ticket after supervisor intervention. The bill, now in committee, aims to break the cycle of impunity for placard holders. Restler has also called for the elimination of placards entirely, stating, 'there are way too many scofflaw federal officers out there driving way too much to get from their (likely) suburban homes to their free, placard-guaranteed parking space in Lower Manhattan.' The affair exposes systemic failures in protecting pedestrians and cyclists from the dangers of unchecked car privilege.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes said, 'Your right to speed does not supersede anyone’s rights to live on the streets safely.' Mayor Eric Adams joined advocates to celebrate, stating, 'A city that never sleeps deserves a camera system that won’t take a nap.' DOT data shows 59% of traffic deaths happened during off hours.

The change targets inexperience behind the wheel. Lives are at stake.</p><p class=mb3>On July 15, 2022, Governor Hochul signed a law requiring cyclist and pedestrian safety awareness in New York's driver licensing process. The bill, led by Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, updates the five-hour pre-licensing course and driver's manual. The matter summary states: 'The law addresses a longstanding gap in driver education, which had previously left generations of motorists with little awareness of road-sharing with pedestrians and cyclists.' Gov. Hochul said, 'It is common sense to make pedestrian and bike safety education mandatory for drivers.' Gounardes noted that driver instruction had not kept pace with the growing presence of cyclists and micro-mobility users. In 2021, driver inexperience contributed to over 2,500 injury crashes in NYC. The law took 11 years to pass, reflecting persistent advocacy for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The developer missed the May deadline for the promised 'Urban Room,' a glass-enclosed public space meant to serve heavy foot traffic. Only a fraction of affordable housing is built. The centerpiece park is missing. Simon demanded Empire State Development (ESD) sanction the developer or renegotiate terms for safer streets and better public space. As Simon put it, 'This is a bad actor that needs to be held accountable.' ESD claims it will work with the developer, but trust is thin. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk in one of Brooklyn’s most dangerous corridors. The state’s failure to enforce commitments leaves vulnerable road users exposed and public trust shattered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, announced July 8, 2022, mirrors a Tennessee law. The bill targets drivers convicted of vehicular manslaughter (first or second degree) or aggravated vehicular homicide. Gounardes said, 'If you drive recklessly, you are going to be held accountable.' He stressed the lack of accountability and financial compensation for victims’ families. The bill is limited to drunk drivers for now, but Gounardes hopes to expand it to all reckless drivers who kill. Few drivers are convicted under these charges in New York City.

Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) criticized the weakest plan, saying, 'I’m really disappointed that after hearing so clearly from the elected officials in the community, from many thousands of neighborhood residents—that still DOT came forward with this presentation tonight.' Restler and others urged DOT to remove a vehicle lane, citing ongoing deaths and injuries. Over 2,500 residents signed a petition for dramatic change.
