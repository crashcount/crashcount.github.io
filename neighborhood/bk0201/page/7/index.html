She struck a third, empty car before New York City Sheriffs arrested her nearby. The pregnant woman was taken to the hospital for evaluation, but no serious injuries were reported.

The project, described as 'Destination: Greenways!', will expand green space, separate bike and pedestrian lanes, add lighting, and install new amenities. Brannan, a key funder and supporter, said, 'Our local parks are the lungs of our city.' The overhaul aims to improve recreational cycling, repair pothole-ridden paths, and increase accessibility.

Vulnerable road users wait for relief.</p><p class=mb3>On November 8, 2024, State Senator Andrew Gounardes responded to Governor Hochul’s revised congestion pricing plan. The new proposal drops the peak toll from $15 to $9. The plan’s status is pending, with urgency to implement before a new presidential administration. Gounardes stressed, “It’s more important than ever that we start congestion pricing immediately, before Trump can block it.” The bill aims to fund the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan, but economist Charles Komanoff warns, “You don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.” The measure is meant to reduce traffic and improve transit, but the lower toll means less impact. The MTA has already paused $16 billion in work. The focus is on starting the program, but advocates note the diluted toll will not deliver the same safety and quality-of-life gains for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move aims to beat a federal block but guts traffic reduction. Streets will see less relief. The plan leaves vulnerable road users exposed. The city trades speed and safety for political timing.</p><p class=mb3>On November 8, 2024, Governor Hochul proposed lowering New York City’s congestion pricing toll from $15 to $9. The plan, a policy proposal to adjust congestion pricing, comes as officials rush to implement it before a new presidential administration can intervene. The original $15 toll, crafted by the Traffic Mobility Review Board and approved by the MTA Board, promised strong traffic reduction and included credits and caps. The $9 version, previously reviewed in environmental assessments, may lack those protections. Economist Charles Komanoff warns, 'You lose other benefits. Most noticeably, you don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes urges swift action, saying, 'The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now.' The lower toll is projected to improve traffic speeds by only 6.4 percent, far less than the 17 percent expected from the original plan. With less traffic reduction, streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler voiced strong support, with Hanif stating, 'Parking mandates block housing, they block extra space for the folks living in communities, they block plazas, and the ability to live in a climate friendly city.' Restler called the policy vital for Brooklyn. Department of City Planning Director Dan Garodnick acknowledged the importance of removing parking mandates but noted the plan could proceed without it. The Council faces pushback from low-density, transit-poor areas.
