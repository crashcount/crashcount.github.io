But the numbers do not comfort. The streets still bleed. In the last three years, people have been crushed, trapped, and left with broken limbs. A 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of an SUV on Furman Street. The driver was speeding. She was trapped, incoherent, and then gone. The man behind the wheel survived, but not unscathed. The street did not forgive either of them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 27-year-old woman crossing with the signal at Tillary and Cadman Plaza West was hit by a turning sedan.

The avenue remains a threat to walkers and riders.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced new safety upgrades for Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. The project, not a council bill but a DOT initiative, includes a mid-block crossing, concrete pedestrian islands, and traffic signal tweaks. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi called the changes a boost for safety and growth. Councilman Lincoln Restler and Community Board 2 pushed for more: daylighting, hard barriers, and a full redesign. DOT declined, citing current priorities. Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives called Atlantic Avenue 'one of the most dangerous streets in New York City' and demanded a bold overhaul. Kelly Carroll of the Atlantic Avenue BID said the fixes are 'smart and needed,' but not enough. Over the past decade, 4,414 crashes injured 1,172 people on this 1.3-mile stretch.

The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority. The Council’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler said, 'I think we're trying to make the best out of a challenging situation,' but admitted his calls for safer, more reliable alternatives were ignored. Citi Bike fares rose 20%. Riders struggle to find bikes or docks. Public defender Shane Ferro called it a missed chance for protected bike lanes and bus corridors.

Simon called it a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez has voiced concerns that daylighting could lead to faster, more dangerous turns, but advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans counter that daylighting is 'proven and widely popular.' The DOT missed a deadline for a daylighting safety study but claims it will daylight 1,000 intersections this year.

The city lost up to $38.7 million in unissued tickets between 2019 and 2022. The resolution calls for higher fines, confiscation of plate coverings, and registration suspensions.

No replacement for the lost $1 billion. Transit riders and street users face uncertainty. Lawmakers call the move reckless. The city waits. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push.

The move falls short of the original goal but marks the largest growth since 1994. Advocates say cameras save lives. Debate continues over equity and coverage.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, the City Council passed a resolution urging the state to expand New York City's red light camera program from 150 to 600 intersections. The measure, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows internal debate and negotiation, with some members pushing for 1,325 intersections and others preferring fewer. The final number represents a four-fold increase, covering about 4 percent of city intersections. The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement. The Department of Transportation called the Council's action a critical step.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA will close the G line in three phases from June 28 to September 2, replacing signals with modern CBTC technology. The matter, titled 'Brooklynites express frustration as G train summer shutdown looms,' drew a packed crowd. Restler said, 'The G train is our lifeline, and for 6 weeks this summer it's gonna be shut down.' Residents and advocates blasted the MTA’s shuttle bus plan as 'absolutely insufficient,' especially for Greenpoint, where the G is the only subway. DOT officials dismissed bus lanes on Manhattan Avenue as unworkable. Cycling improvements remain vague promises.

The shutdown, for CBTC signal upgrades, will halt service in phases along the Crosstown Line. Restler called the G train a 'lifeline' and warned the shutdown will be a 'huge pain.' The city’s mitigation—free shuttle buses, new bus stops, and parking enforcement—faces sharp criticism. Residents and advocates say the plans are 'absolutely insufficient,' especially for Greenpoint, where the G is the only subway. Calls for dedicated busways and cycling infrastructure have gone unanswered. DOT cites narrow streets and the shutdown’s temporary nature.
