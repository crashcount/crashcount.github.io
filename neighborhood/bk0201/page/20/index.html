Three seriously hurt. In Brooklyn Heights, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, traffic violence has left 2 people dead and 3 with life-changing injuries. In the last year alone, 75 people were hurt in 207 crashes. No one under 18 died, but the young are not spared. One child was injured. The streets do not forgive.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. They broke bones and ended lives. Trucks and vans followed close behind. A sedan hit a 23-year-old man crossing near Court Street. He walked away with an abrasion. He was lucky. Others were not. On Furman Street, a Cadillac SUV slammed into a car. A 76-year-old woman died. The driver was trapped, incoherent, and survived. The city moved on. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Speed kills. In February 2025, a drunk driver tore through Atlantic Avenue at 72 mph. He ran a red light and killed Katherine Harris, 31, steps from her home. Her mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/drunk-driver-who-killed-pedestrian-while-driving-72-mph-in-brooklyn-sentenced-to-3-to-9-years/>said, &ldquo;I lost part of me.&rdquo;</a> The driver got three to nine years. The street got nothing.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-silence>Leaders: Action and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has pushed for change. He co-sponsored bills to speed up protected bike lanes, ban parking near crosswalks, and mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders. State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/24/hochul-signs-speed-camera-bill-citing-streetsblogs-coverage-of-unsafe-school-streets>led the charge</a> to expand speed cameras and crack down on drivers who hide their plates. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon backed bills to fine bike lane blockers and force speed-limiting tech on repeat speeders. But most bills are still waiting. The SAFE Streets Act <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>sits in committee</a>. The dead keep waiting too.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-is-not-done>What Next? The Work Is Not Done</h3><p>Every delay is another risk. The city could lower speed limits to 20 mph. It could pass the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>. It could daylight every crosswalk. It could build real protection for people on foot and bike. But it has not. Not yet.</p><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand action.

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) admitted the overhaul would not start until late 2024, with citywide coverage years away. The matter, described as a fix for a 'free-for-all system that led to reckless driving and fatalities,' remains stalled. Council Members Lincoln Restler and Julie Menin pressed DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch on the slow pace and shifting deadlines. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who introduced the original legislation, stressed the need for clear guidance. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure highlighted the deadly consequences of delay. DSNY opposes a bill from Council Member Sandy Nurse to create a working group to address these setbacks.

The Department of Sanitation announced on February 22, 2023, that the citywide overhaul will not begin until late 2024, with a pilot program in one zone. The reform, first set under Mayor de Blasio, aims to fix inefficiency, worker mistreatment, environmental harm, and traffic carnage. The matter summary notes at least 43 deaths and 107 injuries from commercial garbage trucks in nine years. Councilmember Lincoln Restler called the timeline 'extremely slow' and said delays undermine the law's worker and environmental justice goals. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, sponsor of the 2019 bill, stressed that safety improvements for workers are essential and overdue. The pilot zone is still undetermined. Full implementation will roll out across 20 zones over two years, but for now, the danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Intro 417 aims to 'change the approval process of bike lanes and major transportation projects in the community boards,' cutting delays. Intro 501 would fine drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants, with civilians able to report violations and receive a portion of the fine. Reynoso said, 'Those are two pieces I’d love to see pushed absolutely.' He also champions protected bike lanes, a comprehensive bike network, and the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway. Reynoso’s stance is clear: streets must be safer for people walking and biking. He wants action after recent traffic violence and supports more open streets.

Rodriguez said DOT supports the intent but opposes the bills, citing staffing shortages and a need for flexibility. Brooks-Powers expressed disappointment: 'It sounds, unfortunately, like DOT is not supporting any of the bills.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized city austerity and shrinking staff. Advocates, including Amy Cohen, said the bills 'don’t go nearly far enough.'

The Adams administration, represented by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, opposed the bills, arguing, 'Streets are dynamic and conditions are constantly changing. We need to be nimble.' The bills would require DOT to install traffic calming near senior centers, daylight intersections, add school safety signs, study and install bollards, and increase crash reporting. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the mayor’s budget cuts, saying they undermine safety goals. Brooks-Powers pledged to advance the bills, stressing the need for hard infrastructure, especially in Black and Brown neighborhoods. DOT admitted it is behind on bus and bike lane targets.

The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, states the state DOT will only provide technical help to the city’s study of the 1.5-mile city-owned segment between Atlantic Avenue and Sands Street. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the state’s lack of engagement: 'The state hasn't engaged in any way shape or form.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said her community wants the BQE 'revisioned and totally changed,' citing environmental and health impacts. Assembly Member Robert Carroll warned that lack of coordination could worsen problems. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon echoed fears that her constituents would be left behind. The city, under Mayor Adams, has pledged a 'corridor-wide vision,' but admits nothing comprehensive can happen without state DOT. No safety analyst has assessed the impact, but the state’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
