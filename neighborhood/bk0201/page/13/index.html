But the numbers do not comfort. The streets still bleed. In the last three years, people have been crushed, trapped, and left with broken limbs. A 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of an SUV on Furman Street. The driver was speeding. She was trapped, incoherent, and then gone. The man behind the wheel survived, but not unscathed. The street did not forgive either of them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 27-year-old woman crossing with the signal at Tillary and Cadman Plaza West was hit by a turning sedan.

Two-way bus lanes now run where cars once clogged. Concrete islands keep buses moving. Councilmember Restler says the era of endless traffic is over. Riders get speed. Streets get order. Danger shifts.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2024, the city completed a new busway on Livingston Street in Brooklyn. The project, not tied to a specific bill number, was led by the Department of Transportation and praised by Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33). The redesign turned a congested, two-way street into a one-way westbound corridor with two directions of physically-separated, dedicated bus lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the project 'transformed what was a congested, double-parked corridor into two-way fully protected and dedicated bus lanes.' Restler declared, 'Those days are over with the new Livingston Busway!' The project aims to speed up service for 50,000 daily riders and keep cars out of bus lanes with concrete boarding islands. While the article notes ongoing issues with illegal parking and citywide delays, the Livingston Street busway stands as a rare win for bus riders and vulnerable street users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Projects for safer roads stall. Pedestrians and cyclists lose ground. City Hall favors drivers. DOT’s mission weakens. Council Member Restler calls it neutering. Streets grow deadlier. The process delays change. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 10, 2023, Streetsblog NYC reported that Richard Bearak, a City Hall land use official, is quietly interfering with New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) street safety projects. The article, titled 'City Hall Functionary is Quietly Interfering with Critical Street Safety Initiatives: Sources,' details how Bearak reviews and delays projects like McGuinness Boulevard and Underhill Avenue, often demanding changes that benefit private motorists over pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned Bearak’s oversight, stating, 'The Department of Transportation has been neutered.' Bearak, with no transportation background, was placed in this role by Ingrid Lewis-Martin, the mayor’s chief adviser. Officials say this process undermines DOT’s ability to deliver on the Streets Master Plan and the mayor’s promises, risking more deaths and injuries for vulnerable road users. The interference creates extra hurdles for projects already vetted by the public and experts, stalling progress and endangering lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Red Hook Civic Association sent a letter urging the MTA to create a regular-fare bus through the Hugh Carey Tunnel. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the push, saying, "The people of Red Hook really deserve this." The MTA rejected the idea, citing congestion in the tunnel and Lower Manhattan. Joana Flores, MTA spokesperson, said it is more efficient for riders to transfer to the subway. Critics, including Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance, countered, "Bad traffic is not an excuse for not improving bus service, it’s an impetus for decongesting the street." Past proposals to extend the M22 or restore the B71 with a Manhattan extension were dismissed over cost and logistics. Advocates argue that buses move more people than cars and that congestion pricing should clear the way for better transit. The proposal remains stalled, leaving vulnerable riders waiting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
