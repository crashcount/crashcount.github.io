The numbers do not lie. <strong>213 people injured, 2 killed, 3 left with life-altering wounds</strong> since 2022. The dead do not speak. The injured limp, or do not walk at all.

The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes and Assembly Member Gallagher push a bill to force repeat speeders to install limiters. The tech would cap speed, targeting drivers with six or more tickets. Advocates say it could cut deaths. Reckless drivers face real consequences.</p><p class=mb3>On August 2, 2023, State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher announced new legislation targeting recidivist reckless drivers. The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure targets those with a record of speeding and red-light violations. It aims to slow down the worst offenders and curb the rising toll of traffic deaths.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2023, lawmakers introduced a bill requiring speed-limiting devices for repeat reckless drivers. The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, targets drivers with six or more automated speed or red light tickets, or eleven license points in 18 months. The measure would force these drivers to install devices that cap speed at five miles per hour above the limit. Gounardes said, 'There is a persistent cohort of drivers... driving on our streets recklessly without any consequences.' The bill was unveiled at the site of a fatal pedestrian crash in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which mandates safety courses for repeat offenders, has faced criticism for weak enforcement. This new bill seeks to close those gaps and directly slow down the most dangerous drivers on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The discussion, involving Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33), focused on the matter: 'Cyclists say e-bikes, scooters are making bridges more dangerous, with ‘laughable’ enforcement.' Restler, whose district covers DUMBO, Greenpoint, and Brooklyn Heights, expressed reluctance to push for stricter enforcement, noting that many scooter riders are deliveristas pressured by food delivery apps. Cyclists described collisions, injuries, and a lack of NYPD action. One cyclist, Shari Stadel, suffered a concussion and stitches after a crash with scooters on the Manhattan Bridge. Cyclists and witnesses questioned why laws are not enforced. The debate highlighted a growing danger for vulnerable road users, with enforcement lagging behind the surge in high-speed vehicles on narrow bridge paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Four electric scooter riders collided late at night, leaving a trail of blood and fear.

Restler stated, 'It's the lack of e-bike infrastructure in New York City that has pushed deliveristas to mopeds.' He called for safer, easier travel for delivery workers and better infrastructure for charging and storage. Restler criticized enforcement stings as ineffective and defended underpaid workers forced into risky conditions by delivery apps. The NYPD and DOT offered no answers.
