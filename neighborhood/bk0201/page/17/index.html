Three seriously hurt. In Brooklyn Heights, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, traffic violence has left 2 people dead and 3 with life-changing injuries. In the last year alone, 75 people were hurt in 207 crashes. No one under 18 died, but the young are not spared. One child was injured. The streets do not forgive.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. They broke bones and ended lives. Trucks and vans followed close behind. A sedan hit a 23-year-old man crossing near Court Street. He walked away with an abrasion. He was lucky. Others were not. On Furman Street, a Cadillac SUV slammed into a car. A 76-year-old woman died. The driver was trapped, incoherent, and survived. The city moved on. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Speed kills. In February 2025, a drunk driver tore through Atlantic Avenue at 72 mph. He ran a red light and killed Katherine Harris, 31, steps from her home. Her mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/drunk-driver-who-killed-pedestrian-while-driving-72-mph-in-brooklyn-sentenced-to-3-to-9-years/>said, &ldquo;I lost part of me.&rdquo;</a> The driver got three to nine years. The street got nothing.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-silence>Leaders: Action and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has pushed for change. He co-sponsored bills to speed up protected bike lanes, ban parking near crosswalks, and mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders. State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/24/hochul-signs-speed-camera-bill-citing-streetsblogs-coverage-of-unsafe-school-streets>led the charge</a> to expand speed cameras and crack down on drivers who hide their plates. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon backed bills to fine bike lane blockers and force speed-limiting tech on repeat speeders. But most bills are still waiting. The SAFE Streets Act <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>sits in committee</a>. The dead keep waiting too.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-is-not-done>What Next? The Work Is Not Done</h3><p>Every delay is another risk. The city could lower speed limits to 20 mph. It could pass the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>. It could daylight every crosswalk. It could build real protection for people on foot and bike. But it has not. Not yet.</p><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand action.

Council Member Lincoln Restler introduced a resolution urging the state to pass the 'Idaho Stop' law, which would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs. Restler said, 'This would allow bikers to treat red lights as stop signs making cycling safer and bringing us one step closer to Vision Zero!' DOT spokesman Vin Barone confirmed the agency's intent to pursue these changes, though similar efforts have failed before. The Council resolution has little support, and state bills remain stuck in committee. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk while cars dominate the streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
