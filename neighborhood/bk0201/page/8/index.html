The numbers do not lie. <strong>213 people injured, 2 killed, 3 left with life-altering wounds</strong> since 2022. The dead do not speak. The injured limp, or do not walk at all.

Council Member Lincoln Restler said, 'Mayor Adams says he cares about safety, except when it comes to McGuinness Boulevard.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called the compromise 'a plan that does nothing to address the central safety concerns of our community.'

DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone claimed the redesign will make the corridor safer for all users, with new bike lanes and sidewalk extensions.

The new plan converts the outer lane to parking overnight, a design that has led to illegal parking and safety hazards for cyclists. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the plan, saying, 'this plan fails to dramatically slow down traffic on this dangerous boulevard.' The advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe accused the mayor of breaking his promise to prioritize safety. The compromise removes some parking, which local businesses oppose. Despite DOT claims, the redesign does not slow traffic or protect vulnerable road users as promised.

Restler, representing Greenpoint, pushed for car-free shuttle routes and stronger enforcement against double parking. He criticized the Department of Transportation and MTA for disregarding these requests, leaving shuttle riders stuck in traffic and packed buses. Commuters voiced frustration at long waits and crowded conditions. The lack of bus priority exposes vulnerable road users to more danger and delays. The city’s inaction keeps streets clogged and unsafe for everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident, caught on camera, showed a Dodge Durango honking, then plowing through metal fences as volunteers dove for safety. The matter centers on repeated illegal parking by NYPD and municipal workers, which blocks safety measures and shrinks space for pedestrians. Restler stated, "It has been really frustrating that our city agencies that should be partners in this effort have undermined it." Kelly Carroll, Executive Director of the Atlantic Avenue BID, added, "We can't even set up a table if the cars are parked there. It renders the open street moot." No arrests have been made, but police are pursuing felony charges.

The bill, now under consideration, has strong support: sixteen community boards and over three dozen elected officials have signed on. The measure aims to remove parked cars from corners, a practice called 'daylighting,' to improve visibility and cut intersection crashes. Simon called it a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez has voiced concerns that daylighting could lead to faster, more dangerous turns, but advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans counter that daylighting is 'proven and widely popular.' The DOT missed a deadline for a daylighting safety study but claims it will daylight 1,000 intersections this year.
