L'Industrie parks a school bus in the street to serve pizza. DOT threatens fines. Advocates slam the policy. The city gives curb space back to cars. Restaurants lose business. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On December 11, 2024, city enforcement of new outdoor dining rules hit Brooklyn’s L’Industrie pizzeria. The policy, set by Mayor Adams and the City Council, bans curbside dining from November 29 through March, returning the space to private car parking. The Department of Transportation warned the pizzeria it could face fines for serving customers from a parked school bus. Council Member Lincoln Restler called it 'unfortunate that city policy returned this curbside space to parking or vehicle storage rather than more dynamic uses like outdoor dining.' Advocates and business owners, including Zafer Sevimcok and Beatrice Tosti di Valminuta, criticized the ban. The number of restaurants in the permanent outdoor dining program has dropped due to fees and winter restrictions. The city’s move prioritizes car storage over safe, public space for people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Robert Holden, claims to address a 'public safety crisis.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the measure, stating, 'The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal [cycling] behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.' Rodriguez cited data: 105 pedestrians killed by cars this year, versus six by e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters combined. He argued that street redesigns, not new bureaucracy, cut deaths and injuries. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams echoed this, noting that registration backers often resist proven safety fixes like protected bike lanes. Rodriguez warned the bill would waste $19 million and slow adoption of sustainable transport. He called for holding delivery apps accountable and redesigning streets, not targeting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Economic Development Corporation, which manages the heliport, seeks to allow more flights if 50 percent use electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), pending FAA approval. The matter summary states: 'The city could lift a years-old cap on helicopter trips at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in order to get companies to pivot to electric aircraft.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing Brooklyn waterfront neighborhoods, criticized the plan and called for a ban on non-essential tourism and luxury air taxi flights. Restler previously introduced legislation to ban such trips, but it failed. Advocates Melissa Elstein and Andrew Rosenthal of Stop The Chop also oppose the plan, citing noise, quality of life, and expanded luxury service. The contract includes expanded lounges and segregated passenger flows, which advocates see as a move to boost luxury air travel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, a policy proposal to adjust congestion pricing, comes as officials rush to implement it before a new presidential administration can intervene. The original $15 toll, crafted by the Traffic Mobility Review Board and approved by the MTA Board, promised strong traffic reduction and included credits and caps. The $9 version, previously reviewed in environmental assessments, may lack those protections. Economist Charles Komanoff warns, 'You lose other benefits. Most noticeably, you don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes urges swift action, saying, 'The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now.' The lower toll is projected to improve traffic speeds by only 6.4 percent, far less than the 17 percent expected from the original plan.

The collision involved a sedan traveling east and a carry-all merging eastbound. The carry-all driver committed 'Unsafe Lane Changing,' cited twice as the contributing factor. The impact occurred at the right front bumper of the carry-all and the left front bumper of the sedan. The sedan driver, a 42-year-old male, sustained neck injuries and complained of whiplash but was conscious and not ejected. Both drivers were licensed in New York. The report explicitly identifies the carry-all driver’s unsafe lane change as the cause, with no contributing factors attributed to the sedan driver or any victim behavior.

The proposal, under the Town Center Zoning plan, aims to boost small-scale, mixed-use housing. Council Members Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler voiced strong support, with Hanif stating, 'Parking mandates block housing, they block extra space for the folks living in communities, they block plazas, and the ability to live in a climate friendly city.' Restler called the policy vital for Brooklyn. Department of City Planning Director Dan Garodnick acknowledged the importance of removing parking mandates but noted the plan could proceed without it. The Council faces pushback from low-density, transit-poor areas. Progressive groups and experts argue that ending parking mandates is overdue and would reshape housing, public space, and climate policy citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The original lane reduction and protected bike lane plan, previously scrapped, will now move forward for the southern half of the street, between Calyer Street and Meeker Avenue. The matter, described as a return to 'the road diet it had previously finalized and then rejected,' follows months of community outcry and advocacy.

Restler stated, 'this is a decision that enhances safety in our community, and that's what matters.'
