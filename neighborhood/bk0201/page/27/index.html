But the numbers do not comfort. The streets still bleed. In the last three years, people have been crushed, trapped, and left with broken limbs. A 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of an SUV on Furman Street. The driver was speeding. She was trapped, incoherent, and then gone. The man behind the wheel survived, but not unscathed. The street did not forgive either of them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 27-year-old woman crossing with the signal at Tillary and Cadman Plaza West was hit by a turning sedan. She walked with the light. The car turned anyway. Her knee and leg were crushed. She lived. The pain stays.</p><p>A 23-year-old man, not at an intersection, was struck by a sedan on Court Street. He was emerging from behind a parked car. The city calls it an abrasion. The city does not count the fear.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-bills-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Bills, and the Waiting</h2><p>Local leaders have written bills. Council Member Restler has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>sponsored laws</a> to speed up protected bike lanes, ban parking near crosswalks, and mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders. The bills sit in committee. The SAFE Streets Act waits for a vote. The city promises daylight at crossings, but cars still block the view. The law says to wait. The street does not wait.</p><p>State Senator Gounardes has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>pushed for speed cameras and speed limiters</a>.

The danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2022, Streetsblog NYC reported on the launch of NYC SpeedCamBuster, a cellphone app that alerts drivers to speed and red-light camera locations. The article, titled "New App Helps Reckless Drivers Thumb Their Noses at City’s Speed Cameras," details how the app lets drivers evade enforcement and dispute tickets. Safe-streets groups, including Transportation Alternatives and engineer Jehiah Czebotar, condemned the app. Jacob deCastro of Transportation Alternatives said, "If drivers want to avoid speeding tickets, they simply should not speed." Czebotar added, "Any demand for notifications to help drivers avoid speed cameras is proof that actually enforcing the speed limit does change driver behavior for the better." The NYPD warned that such apps undermine public safety. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes is pushing to reauthorize and expand the speed camera program. The app, and others like it, threaten vulnerable road users by making streets less safe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in May 2022, aims to allow 24/7 automated enforcement and add penalties for repeat offenders, including registration suspensions. The matter summary: 'DOT officials said they’re negotiating amendments to Gounardes’ bill that would further crack down on reckless drivers, including a provision to let the city install cameras to ticket cars in bike lanes.' Gounardes stressed urgency: 'We cannot leave Albany without reauthorizing the speed cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s late push for home rule caused confusion, risking the program’s renewal. The bill is under negotiation as the legislative session nears its end. Eleven people died on city streets that week, underscoring the stakes for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July. Assembly Member William Magnarelli, chair of the Transportation Committee, blamed City Hall for inaction. Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo. Without home rule, New York City’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—face continued risk from political delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, which is non-binding, was not assigned to a council committee but sets a template for local advocacy and funding. The plan’s summary states it will 'address local climate crises by reducing building and vehicular emissions, expanding green space and infrastructure, building storm surge protection, and achieving zero waste.' Restler, the sole sponsor, called for urgent neighborhood action, saying, 'We need to roll up our sleeves and take action at the local level, at the neighborhood level on our blocks.' The plan proposes new bike lanes, electrified school buses, and more renewable energy. Environmental advocates back the approach for its focus on neighborhood needs.

The bill stalled, filed at session’s end.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0224-2022 was introduced on April 28, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill sought to amend city law to 'restrict the use of bus lanes by sight-seeing buses.' It would have prohibited sightseeing buses from using bus lanes between 7–10 a.m. and 4–7 p.m. on weekdays. The Department of Transportation would also be barred from authorizing sightseeing bus stops in bus lanes during those hours. Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor), Justin Brannan, Sandy Nurse, Lincoln Restler, and Diana Ayala backed the bill. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The bill aimed to keep bus lanes clear for transit, reducing congestion and potential conflict with pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He announced a $904 million budget for safety improvements and said, 'We need to find them proactively, and get them off the streets.' Adams called for meetings with precincts and targeting dangerous intersections. But he gave no specifics on enforcement, legislative changes, or expanding the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Advocates like Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) and Sara Lind (Open Plans) welcomed the words but demanded concrete action, especially from the NYPD. The city’s current laws limit its power to remove dangerous drivers. Pending state bills could help, but for now, the mayor’s promise remains just that—words, not protection for those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, part of ongoing budget talks, aims to fund hundreds of miles of protected bike and bus lanes, plus concrete barriers. Council Member Lincoln Restler of District 33, a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, praised the move as 'a very clear commitment to addressing street safety across the five boroughs.' The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists. The Council had requested $3.1 billion, but Restler called the $900 million a dramatic investment. The budget must be finalized by June 30.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan follows the City Council's push for a $3.1 billion, five-year budget. Adams said, 'We're making a historical announcement to continue to keep our streets safe.' Council Member Lincoln Restler called it 'a big, big, big day for street safety.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'We will be building even more bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes as well as new plaza and other public space.' The funding will upgrade weakly protected bike lanes and step up enforcement against reckless drivers. Advocates, including Transportation Alternatives, praised the move as transformational for vulnerable road users. The investment marks a major step to reclaim streets from cars and address rising traffic deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began. The mayor’s proposed $98.5-billion budget did not allocate significant funds for the plan. Advocates say the city must act now to stem the bloodshed on its streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The review, covered by Streetsblog, highlighted the lack of a defined safe passing distance, restrictions on local speed limits, and missing public data on police stops. The League of American Bicyclists noted, 'New York is way behind other states on having a safe passage law, as 38 other states do.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called for urgent legislative fixes, including road-sharing training, lower speed limits, and keeping speed cameras on. Emily Gallagher, District 50, was mentioned in the advocacy push. The report underscores how state inaction leaves cyclists and pedestrians at risk, despite some progress in infrastructure and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
