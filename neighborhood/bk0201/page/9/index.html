But the numbers do not comfort. The streets still bleed. In the last three years, people have been crushed, trapped, and left with broken limbs. A 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of an SUV on Furman Street. The driver was speeding. She was trapped, incoherent, and then gone. The man behind the wheel survived, but not unscathed. The street did not forgive either of them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 27-year-old woman crossing with the signal at Tillary and Cadman Plaza West was hit by a turning sedan. She walked with the light. The car turned anyway. Her knee and leg were crushed. She lived. The pain stays.</p><p>A 23-year-old man, not at an intersection, was struck by a sedan on Court Street. He was emerging from behind a parked car. The city calls it an abrasion. The city does not count the fear.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-bills-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Bills, and the Waiting</h2><p>Local leaders have written bills. Council Member Restler has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>sponsored laws</a> to speed up protected bike lanes, ban parking near crosswalks, and mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders.

The street does not wait.</p><p>State Senator Gounardes has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>pushed for speed cameras and speed limiters</a>.

The city lacks oversight. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls placards a public safety risk. The report urges digital permits and real accountability. Danger remains for those on foot.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2024, the Department of Investigation released an oversight report exposing widespread NYPD placard abuse and enforcement failures. The report, mandated by Local Law 6 of 2020, found 'widespread misuse by the NYPD of city-issued parking placards, failure by the city to monitor who has placards, and a complete abrogation of enforcement against cops.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, District 33, has long opposed placards, calling them 'not just an abuse of power [but] a public safety risk and nuisance.' The report recommends a uniform digital permit system, elimination of 'self-enforcement' zones, and stricter 311 complaint handling. The NYPD failed to complete required evaluations and often ignored complaints. The DOI calls for better officer training and for traffic enforcement agents to handle placard abuse. The system, as it stands, leaves vulnerable road users exposed to illegal parking and unchecked driver privilege.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law required NYPD to evaluate placard abuse and illegal parking hotspots. The report, titled 'Long-Awaited Placard Report Reveals Widespread Abuse by NYPD,' found rampant misuse of city-issued parking placards, little oversight, and near-total lack of enforcement against police officers. Council Member Lincoln Restler called placards 'a public safety risk and nuisance.' The DOI recommends ending self-enforcement zones, adopting digital permits, and requiring real proof before closing 311 complaints. The NYPD failed to complete required evaluations. The report exposes a system that puts vulnerable road users at risk by allowing illegal parking to go unchecked, especially near stationhouses. The DOI urges reforms to restore public trust and protect people outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Broadway Stages president Gina Argento argued bike lanes would be unsafe due to truck traffic, despite DOT data showing bike lanes reduce injuries.

The measure remains in committee. The bill responds to a fatal flaw: 'We have no mechanism right now, under law, to crack down on extremely reckless drivers,' said Brooklyn State Sen.

Fines are low. Many ignore them. Council Member Restler and Assembly Member Simone push bills to hike penalties. The city’s old crackdown expired. Lawmakers want real consequences for repeat scofflaws.</p><p class=mb3>Council Member Lincoln Restler introduced a bill to raise fines for drivers who fail to move cars during alternate-side parking. The bill would increase the penalty to $100 for a second offense within a year and require towing after three violations in 12 months. Assembly Member Tony Simone submitted a state bill to double fines after the tenth violation, up to five times the current cap. The matter targets 'the worst repeat offenders of parking tickets.' Manhattan safe streets activist Jehiah Czebotar analyzed city data, finding that 77 percent of street-sweeping tickets go to repeat offenders, with 37 percent to drivers who got at least six tickets. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired last year, leaving a gap in enforcement. Lawmakers say fines must deter, not just be a cost of doing business.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders face dead batteries, empty docks, and mounting frustration. The city promised a pilot last year. Still, the streets wait. The delay leaves e-bike users stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On February 29, 2024, Council Member Erik Bottcher called out the Department of Transportation and Con Edison for failing to deliver electrified Citi Bike docks in his Manhattan district. The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
