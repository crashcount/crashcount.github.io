Action demanded.</p><p class=mb3>On October 10, 2022, Councilman Lincoln Restler (District 33) introduced a bill to the New York City Council. The measure, now under committee review, proposes a civilian reporting and reward program for illegal parking enforcement. The bill summary states: 'New York City is considering a policy that would pay people up to $44 for each actionable tip about cars illegally blocking bike lanes and intersections.' Restler, the sole sponsor, said, 'Too many parents with strollers, people in wheelchairs and bicyclists face unsafe conditions every day because of sidewalks and bike lanes obstructed by illegal parking.' The bill would empower the Department of Transportation to enlist civilians to flag violators, with a 25% share of fines as reward. The NYPD opposes the plan, warning it could pit neighbor against neighbor and outsource risk to civilians. The bill aims to protect vulnerable road users by targeting hazardous obstructions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report details Rana’s 2018 guilty plea for reckless driving, including speeding, ignoring signals, and driving against traffic without cause. He also falsified 43 command log entries and was often absent or late. Despite this, Rana rose to lead a precinct notorious for placard abuse, illegal parking, and weak traffic enforcement. Council Member Lincoln Restler said, “We have not seen adequate enforcement of illegal parking in the 84 and across the city.” Former Council Member Steve Levin called the violations serious and demanded accountability. Advocates and officials question if Rana’s behavior shapes a culture that endangers pedestrians and cyclists. The NYPD and Rana declined comment. The area remains a hotspot for crashes and injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The draft would ban restaurants from serving in roadside spaces during winter. The matter, discussed on September 30, 2022, is still in committee. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified, 'The bill does continue to allow outdoor dining on the streets at certain times while regulating permanent structures.' Council Member Lincoln Restler supports year-round, permanent outdoor dining, stating, 'I strongly support making this program permanent, year round, and simple for neighborhood restaurants to participate in.' Andrew Rigie of the NYC Hospitality Alliance echoed support for year-round streetery structures. The bill’s seasonal ban has drawn fire from restaurateurs, who warn it could shutter businesses. The council continues to negotiate the details, balancing business needs and city regulation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In the first three weeks, cameras issued 513,777 tickets—70 percent more than before. The bill, championed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, removed harsher penalties but kept round-the-clock enforcement. The matter summary states, 'speed safety cameras are working as they should—catching more speeding drivers and combatting reckless driving.' Council members and advocates, including Elizabeth Adams and Jehiah Czebotar, backed the move. They point to data showing most extra tickets came at night and weekends, exposing a hidden threat to pedestrians and cyclists. Officials insist the expansion will save lives and curb reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street has seen 1,594 crashes, 44 cyclist injuries, 67 pedestrian injuries, and three deaths since 2013. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher announced the changes, which include daylighting intersections, banning left turns at key avenues, and adding painted pedestrian extensions. Gallagher said, 'Quick, iterative incremental changes will be a great way to reduce injuries and fatalities rather than waiting for an entire overhaul.' Council Member Lincoln Restler praised the upgrades as 'a step in the right direction.' Bronwyn Breitner of Make McGuinness Safe Coalition called for a full-scale redesign, reallocating space from cars to people. The city will revisit the corridor plan this winter after installing these measures in the fall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The final call lands with the Traffic Mobility Review Board.</p><p class=mb3>On August 26, 2022, the council held a public debate on congestion pricing exemptions. The matter, titled 'Everyone’s Suddenly Open To Some Congestion Pricing Exemptions,' drew sharp lines. State Senator Leroy Comrie, once a hardliner against exemptions, now listens to public input. Assembly Member Robert Carroll backs limited carve-outs, saying, 'I think that there should be limited exemptions.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes stresses, 'Obviously we want them to be as limited as possible.' Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine pushes for toll credits and taxi exemptions. Advocacy groups warn against broad carve-outs. The Traffic Mobility Review Board will decide after federal review. The debate centers on who pays and who gets a pass, while the safety of people outside cars hangs in the balance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
