Three seriously hurt. In Brooklyn Heights, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, traffic violence has left 2 people dead and 3 with life-changing injuries. In the last year alone, 75 people were hurt in 207 crashes. No one under 18 died, but the young are not spared. One child was injured. The streets do not forgive.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. They broke bones and ended lives. Trucks and vans followed close behind. A sedan hit a 23-year-old man crossing near Court Street. He walked away with an abrasion. He was lucky. Others were not. On Furman Street, a Cadillac SUV slammed into a car. A 76-year-old woman died. The driver was trapped, incoherent, and survived. The city moved on. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Speed kills. In February 2025, a drunk driver tore through Atlantic Avenue at 72 mph. He ran a red light and killed Katherine Harris, 31, steps from her home. Her mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/drunk-driver-who-killed-pedestrian-while-driving-72-mph-in-brooklyn-sentenced-to-3-to-9-years/>said, &ldquo;I lost part of me.&rdquo;</a> The driver got three to nine years. The street got nothing.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-silence>Leaders: Action and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has pushed for change. He co-sponsored bills to speed up protected bike lanes, ban parking near crosswalks, and mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders. State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/24/hochul-signs-speed-camera-bill-citing-streetsblogs-coverage-of-unsafe-school-streets>led the charge</a> to expand speed cameras and crack down on drivers who hide their plates. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon backed bills to fine bike lane blockers and force speed-limiting tech on repeat speeders. But most bills are still waiting. The SAFE Streets Act <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>sits in committee</a>. The dead keep waiting too.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-is-not-done>What Next? The Work Is Not Done</h3><p>Every delay is another risk. The city could lower speed limits to 20 mph. It could pass the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>. It could daylight every crosswalk. It could build real protection for people on foot and bike. But it has not. Not yet.</p><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand action.

The bill, announced on February 8, 2024, removes prior compromises—no phased rollout, no mandatory training, no ID hurdles. The measure, previously stripped down in committee, now returns to its original form. The matter title: 'Prophet Motive: Restler Bill Would Restore 25% Bounty for Blocked Bike and Bus Lane Tickets.' Restler vows to push hard for passage, saying, 'This bill would make a tremendous difference in making our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.' The bill’s fate is uncertain after Restler’s removal from the Transportation Committee, but the intent is clear: shift enforcement from NYPD to the people, and clear the way for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Signals, ramps, and paint force drivers to slow. Pedestrians gain a fighting chance on Brooklyn’s deadliest stretch. Local leaders push for more. The city’s hand finally moves after years of blood.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced new mid-block pedestrian crossings on Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn’s so-called 'Boulevard of Death.' The crossings, between Nevins and Bond, Bond and Hoyt, and Hoyt and Smith streets, add crosswalks, traffic lights, and ramps. Restler said, 'These new mid-block crossings will create a greater sense of safety and community for Boerum Hill.' The Department of Transportation acted after Restler and others demanded change following the death of Katherine Harris, killed by a speeding driver. DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks. Leaders want more: curb extensions, redesigned crossings, and further traffic calming.

If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action.

The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary notes Restler's intent to remain active: 'I am reintroducing 501, the citizen reporting bill, and will push as hard as I can to get it over the finish line.' Restler has sponsored bills to curb illegal parking, speed up bike lane installations, and fight placard abuse. Despite his removal, advocates and colleagues, including Jon Orcutt, voiced confidence that Restler will continue to fight for pedestrian and cyclist safety.
