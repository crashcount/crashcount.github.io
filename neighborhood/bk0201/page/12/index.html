But the numbers do not comfort. The streets still bleed. In the last three years, people have been crushed, trapped, and left with broken limbs. A 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of an SUV on Furman Street. The driver was speeding. She was trapped, incoherent, and then gone. The man behind the wheel survived, but not unscathed. The street did not forgive either of them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 27-year-old woman crossing with the signal at Tillary and Cadman Plaza West was hit by a turning sedan. She walked with the light. The car turned anyway. Her knee and leg were crushed. She lived. The pain stays.</p><p>A 23-year-old man, not at an intersection, was struck by a sedan on Court Street. He was emerging from behind a parked car. The city calls it an abrasion. The city does not count the fear.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-bills-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Bills, and the Waiting</h2><p>Local leaders have written bills. Council Member Restler has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>sponsored laws</a> to speed up protected bike lanes, ban parking near crosswalks, and mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders.

The street does not wait.</p><p>State Senator Gounardes has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>pushed for speed cameras and speed limiters</a>.

Streets remain deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On February 22, 2024, a woman was struck and critically injured by Stanley Manel, a driver with 26 prior speed camera violations, at Sutton Street and Nassau Avenue in Greenpoint. Manel was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Nassau Avenue, a two-way street used by cyclists, lacks protective infrastructure. Following the crash, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez called for passage of two state bills: one requiring repeat speeding offenders to install intelligent speed assistance devices, and Sammy's Law, which would let the City Council lower speed limits. They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections. Their statement reads: “Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers.”</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, announced on February 8, 2024, removes prior compromises—no phased rollout, no mandatory training, no ID hurdles. The measure, previously stripped down in committee, now returns to its original form. The matter title: 'Prophet Motive: Restler Bill Would Restore 25% Bounty for Blocked Bike and Bus Lane Tickets.' Restler vows to push hard for passage, saying, 'This bill would make a tremendous difference in making our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.' The bill’s fate is uncertain after Restler’s removal from the Transportation Committee, but the intent is clear: shift enforcement from NYPD to the people, and clear the way for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action. Vulnerable road users face risk if the program lapses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>The Clean Deliveries Act, now under consideration in Albany, aims to regulate last-mile warehouse traffic and emissions across New York State. The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move shifted Restler, known for championing safe streets, to chair the Governmental Operations, State and Federal Legislation Committee. The matter summary notes Restler's intent to remain active: 'I am reintroducing 501, the citizen reporting bill, and will push as hard as I can to get it over the finish line.' Restler has sponsored bills to curb illegal parking, speed up bike lane installations, and fight placard abuse. Despite his removal, advocates and colleagues, including Jon Orcutt, voiced confidence that Restler will continue to fight for pedestrian and cyclist safety. The committee change may slow progress on key safety bills, but Restler's record and resolve remain strong.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, backed by a $368 million contract, aims to modernize signals along the Crosstown Line. The MTA proposes closures starting June 28, with shuttle buses replacing trains. Restler called CBTC 'a vital investment' but warned that 'a full shutdown of the G train in Greenpoint for six weeks would cause harm and disruption to our community.' He urged the MTA to 'act nimbly and find alternative construction approaches.' The G train is a lifeline for thousands in Greenpoint. The closure will push more people onto streets and buses, raising risks for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
