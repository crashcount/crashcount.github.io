The funding, praised by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Mayor Eric Adams, aims to 'revitalize the Brooklyn Marine Terminal,' reduce truck traffic, and modernize infrastructure. The NYC Economic Development Corporation took over BMT from the Port Authority in May. U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler warned the deal could increase truck traffic and threaten jobs, but stressed the port's importance. The grant targets repairs, modernization, and traffic reduction. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.

The bill aims to end high costs that block riders. If passed, e-bike trips under an hour would match the MTA fare. Bike-share could become true public transit.</p><p class=mb3>Bill introduced by Council Member Lincoln Restler on September 16, 2024, seeks to cap Citi Bike e-bike fares at the current subway or bus rate. The measure, not yet passed, awaits committee review and would take effect in 2029 if the city renews its contract with Lyft. The bill summary reads: 'Citi Bike members would not pay more than the MTA's intra-city transit fare for any e-bike ride under an hour or any non-electric Citi Bike ride under two hours.' Restler, the bill's sponsor, argues, 'Bike share is an essential part of transit in NYC. It needs to be affordable & accessible for all.' He criticizes the current model, where e-bike rides can cost up to $7.20 for a half-hour, far above the $2.90 subway fare. The bill would require public investment to lower fares, following models in Boston and Washington, D.C. No safety analyst has yet assessed the bill's impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, not yet numbered, will not take effect until the next contract in 2029. Restler, who called current fees 'out of control,' also urged the city to connect Citi Bike docks to the electrical grid. He said, 'What a silly system we have that's depending on hundreds of cars and trucks going around New York City to recharge our sustainable form of transit.' Restler’s push aims to make e-bikes accessible for working-class New Yorkers and reduce car and truck trips tied to battery swaps. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the bill’s focus is clear: lower barriers for vulnerable road users and cut vehicle miles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plaza, once open all week, will now close to cars only on weekends. Locals and advocates wanted more. Businesses pushed back. Most neighbors don’t own cars. The fight for safe space continues.</p><p class=mb3>On August 13, 2024, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced it would end 24/7 pedestrianization of Bedford Slip in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The decision, not a council bill but a DOT action, follows a six-week trial during the G train shutdown. DOT will allow car-free hours only on weekends from late September through year’s end. The matter summary: 'DOT Rejects 24-7 Open Street for ‘Bedford Slip,’ Preferring Weekend-Only Hours.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Rep. Nydia Velázquez supported a permanent plaza. Katie Denny Horowitz of the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance vowed to keep pushing for full-time closure. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno said the agency is working with residents on a long-term vision. Most local households rely on transit, biking, or walking. The decision leaves vulnerable road users with less protection during the week.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 29-year-old female SUV driver, traveling westbound and going straight ahead, was struck when a box truck, also westbound, changed lanes without yielding right-of-way. The report cites the box truck driver's failure to yield and unsafe lane changing as contributing factors. The SUV overturned and was demolished on impact. The SUV driver, who was wearing a lap belt and harness, was not ejected but sustained neck injuries and was in shock, complaining of pain or nausea. The box truck showed no damage.

A sedan and a bicycle, both traveling northbound, collided when the sedan struck the bicycle from behind. The bicyclist, a 24-year-old male wearing a helmet, was partially ejected and sustained head injuries, including abrasions, and was reported in shock. The report cites 'Pavement Slippery' as a contributing factor for the bicyclist and the crash. The bicyclist was unlicensed, which is noted in the vehicle data. The sedan, a 2023 Toyota with two occupants and a licensed male driver, sustained damage to its center back end. The collision point on the bicycle was the center front end. The data does not indicate any fault or error by the sedan driver beyond the conditions, but the unlicensed status of the bicyclist and slippery pavement contributed to the severity of the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Cyclists and walkers claimed space. Safety replaced speed.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2024, a one-day closure of Driggs Avenue—dubbed 'Driggs Passage'—cut car traffic through McCarren Park in Williamsburg. The event, not a formal bill but a policy experiment, was championed by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Greenpoint), who said, "Today is a one-day experiment to just experience what it would be like to not have cars flying through the middle of our community's primary green space." The closure united two halves of the park, creating 1.5 acres of new open space. Organizers and residents, including Katie Denny Horowitz of the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance, called for a permanent ban on cars. Since 2020, city data shows 42 crashes on this stretch, injuring six cyclists and one pedestrian. The move echoes past car bans in Central and Prospect Parks, but faces resistance from city officials. The day showed what’s possible when cars yield to people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'slow-moving buses were an unfortunate and avoidable inevitability,' highlights the city’s refusal to provide dedicated busways during the $622 million signal upgrade. Restler, representing Greenpoint, pushed for car-free shuttle routes and stronger enforcement against double parking. He criticized the Department of Transportation and MTA for disregarding these requests, leaving shuttle riders stuck in traffic and packed buses. Commuters voiced frustration at long waits and crowded conditions. The lack of bus priority exposes vulnerable road users to more danger and delays.

The project, led by NYC DOT, brings mid-block crossings, concrete pedestrian islands, curb enhancements, and split-phase signals to one of Brooklyn’s deadliest corridors. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push.
