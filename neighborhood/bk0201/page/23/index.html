He warns of profit-driven vigilantes. He says it breeds conflict, strips due process, and targets the poor. He calls for protected bike lanes, not citizen informants. The fight for safer streets turns bitter.</p><p class=mb3>On October 14, 2022, Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) published an op-ed opposing a council bill that would pay civilians to report cars blocking bike lanes, sidewalks, or crosswalks. The bill, not yet voted on or assigned a committee, would give informants 25% of each $175 ticket. Restler writes, 'Turning citizens into vigilantes with a profit incentive...is not the right way.' He argues the bill creates perverse incentives, strips due process, and could trap low-income New Yorkers in debt. Restler supports protected bike lanes as a proven safety measure, noting, 'New York City recently installed more protected bike lanes, and subsequently saw a decrease in pedestrian deaths.' He urges the city to keep enforcement out of private hands and focus on systemic fixes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal’s summary states it will 'prioritize people over parking,' aiming to make streets safer and housing more affordable. Council Member Lincoln Restler supports the move, saying, 'we need affordable housing, economic development... not more parking.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman calls parking spaces a poor use of land amid a housing crisis. Advocates like Sara Lind urge full elimination, citing pollution and congestion. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remains noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and open to review. The proposal is in early stages, with state legislation also in play.

Restler said, 'In urban hubs like Lower Manhattan, the heart of the South Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn or Downtown Jamaica, we need affordable housing, economic development with good jobs, and dynamic mixed use buildings, not more parking.' The bill has drawn support from advocates and developers, who argue that parking mandates drive up housing costs and disrupt pedestrian-friendly streets.

Restler, the sole sponsor, said, 'Too many parents with strollers, people in wheelchairs and bicyclists face unsafe conditions every day because of sidewalks and bike lanes obstructed by illegal parking.' The bill would empower the Department of Transportation to enlist civilians to flag violators, with a 25% share of fines as reward.

The bill required the Department of Transportation to study truck drivers’ compliance with city truck routes and to assess integrating truck maps with GPS technology. The matter’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a truck route GPS study.' Alexa Avilés sponsored the bill, joined by Gutiérrez, Hanif, Restler, Brooks-Powers, Hudson, Krishnan, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill called for measures like converting two-way streets to one-way, posting truck route signs, and outreach to the trucking industry. The study’s results were to be posted online and sent to the council by January 1, 2023. The bill was filed at session’s end, with no further action.

The piece urges the Federal Highway Administration to approve the MTA's Central Business District Tolling Program. Restler writes, "Congestion pricing will reduce through-traffic in our neighborhood, improve air quality and quality of life for residents, and allow for substantial investments in a public transportation system that all New Yorkers rely on." He highlights the risk of further delay for the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, a corridor plagued by crashes and pollution. Restler supports reducing car dependence and warns that restoring more lanes to the BQE would fuel more danger and cost. The op-ed calls for bold action to protect communities and prioritize transit over traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Mayor’s Management Report shows only 32 protected bike lane miles and 2 bus lane miles added in fiscal year 2022—far short of the annual targets. Councilman Lincoln Restler, District 33, is quoted: “We’ve approved $904 million for better bus lanes, more pedestrian space, and protected bike lanes and now we need to pick up the pace on implementation.” Restler pledges robust oversight and accountability, pressing the Department of Transportation to deliver. The report details frustration from council members and advocates over missed deadlines, slow progress, and persistent dangers for vulnerable road users.

The statement, titled 'Congestion Pricing Benefits Are Inarguable; Its Minor Problems are Easily Fixable,' urged city, state, and federal leaders to advance the Central Business District Tolling Program. Wright said, 'Congestion pricing will have benefits for communities across the city and region: It will reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. It will raise vital revenue for public transit. It will make the transportation system more equitable.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler planned a rally in support. The statement acknowledged minor impacts, like increased traffic on select highways, but insisted these can be addressed by electrifying fleets and capping highways.
