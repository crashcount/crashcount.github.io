But the numbers do not comfort. The streets still bleed. In the last three years, people have been crushed, trapped, and left with broken limbs. A 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of an SUV on Furman Street. The driver was speeding. She was trapped, incoherent, and then gone. The man behind the wheel survived, but not unscathed. The street did not forgive either of them. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 27-year-old woman crossing with the signal at Tillary and Cadman Plaza West was hit by a turning sedan. She walked with the light. The car turned anyway. Her knee and leg were crushed. She lived. The pain stays.</p><p>A 23-year-old man, not at an intersection, was struck by a sedan on Court Street. He was emerging from behind a parked car. The city calls it an abrasion. The city does not count the fear.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-bills-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Bills, and the Waiting</h2><p>Local leaders have written bills. Council Member Restler has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>sponsored laws</a> to speed up protected bike lanes, ban parking near crosswalks, and mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders. The bills sit in committee. The SAFE Streets Act waits for a vote. The city promises daylight at crossings, but cars still block the view. The law says to wait. The street does not wait.</p><p>State Senator Gounardes has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>pushed for speed cameras and speed limiters</a>. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force the worst drivers to slow down. It has not passed.

Council Members Kamillah Hanks (primary sponsor), Oswald Feliz, Robert F. Holden, Farah N. Louis, Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, Mercedes Narcisse, and Amanda Farías co-sponsored. The bill would force the NYPD to run tow pounds with enough space to tow cars at a rate that deters illegal conduct.

The bill's title reads: "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting dynamic pricing under the city’s bike share program." Council Member Lincoln Restler is the primary sponsor, joined by Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, and Francisco P. Moya. Their action: sponsorship and referral to committee. The bill would stop the Department of Transportation from allowing dynamic pricing—defined as any fee increase based on demand—in the Citi Bike program. The goal: keep bike share affordable and predictable for all riders, especially those who rely on it most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
