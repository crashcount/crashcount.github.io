The rest lived, hurt.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks>Where the street breaks</h3><p>Cadman Plaza West is a wound. It leads the map for this area with injuries and a death. The city’s own data marks it a hotspot <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>on Cadman Plaza West</a>. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>BQE</a> is worse by volume and took a life too. Afternoon hours hit hardest here: injuries stack from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., with deaths logged at 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. in the historical record.</p><p>A 76‑year‑old woman died in 2022 on Cadman Plaza West. The police file lists “Unsafe Speed.” It also lists “Aggressive Driving/Road Rage.” She was trapped in the wreckage. The driver, 60, was injured. It is all in the city’s data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>for that crash</a>.</p><p>In 2023, a 48‑year‑old driver died on the BQE. The file says “Lost Consciousness.” Two vehicles. Impact at speed. It sits in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>BQE record</a>.</p><p>This summer, another driver died on Henry Street. A parked Mini. A Mazda sedan going straight. The woman was 58, marked “Apparent Death” in the log. The entry is dry and final. It lives in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>August 19, 2025 file</a>.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hit-and-when>Who gets hit, and when</h3><p>Pedestrians keep taking the blow. Forty‑eight injured since 2022, with a serious injury on record. Sedans are the main strike vehicle for people on foot—22 pedestrian injuries traced to them, with one serious. Trucks follow with seven. The counts come from the city’s rollup for this area <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>since 2022</a>.</p><p>Bicyclists were hit 17 times. One serious injury. One file shows a rider cut deep on Atlantic Avenue in April. The log says the SUV was parked; the cyclist was “Going Straight Ahead.” It lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction” and “Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other… Error/Confusion.” Read the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>April 7, 2025 entry</a>.</p><p>Crashes swell in daylight. Injuries spike around noon and into the afternoon. Eleven people hurt at midnight. Nine at 1 a.m. The clock does not care. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hour‑by‑hour counts</a> show no safe hour.</p><h3 id=how-the-system-records-pain>How the system records pain</h3><p>The forms cite causes. “Other” leads this map with 74 injuries. “Vulnerable road user error” shows 17 more injuries. “Inattention/Distraction” adds three. “Disregarded traffic control.” “Backing unsafely.” The labels are blunt. They do not mend bone. They sit in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>contributing factors list</a>.</p><p>A mother, a boy, and a front‑seat passenger were hurt in a December 2024 crash at Adams and Fulton. The log names “Unsafe Speed” and “Traffic Control Disregarded.” A 55‑year‑old bled from the head. The child and teen list whiplash. It is all in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>December 7, 2024 record</a>.</p><h3 id=promises-on-paper>Promises on paper</h3><p>At City Hall, Council Member Lincoln Restler backs a state bill to ticket owners by camera for illegal parking. The resolution calls for passing A.5440. The aim is simple: stop the blockages that force people into traffic. The council file is here: <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Res 1024‑2025</a>.</p><p>Restler also co‑sponsors a law to make DOT install school‑zone safety devices within 60 days after a study. The bill is <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1353‑2025</a>. It is in committee.</p><p>Up in Albany, Senator Andrew Gounardes pushed and voted to extend the school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. The governor signed it. Coverage and statements are here in <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog</a>. He also advanced a bill to force speed limiters on repeat dangerous drivers. Committee votes show he voted yes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-help-on-these-blocks>What would help on these blocks</h3><p>Start with the corners that keep breaking: Cadman Plaza West and the BQE ramps. Then Adams at Fulton. Daylight the crosswalks. Harden the turns. Give pedestrians a head start. Use cameras to keep bus lanes, bike lanes, and crosswalks clear—what <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Res 1024‑2025</a> seeks to unlock. Install school‑front safety fast under <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1353‑2025</a>.</p><p>Across the city, lower the default speed limit and rein in repeat speeders. The legislature already renewed school‑zone cameras through 2030, as covered by <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog</a>. The next step is passing speed limiters for the worst drivers—tracked in committee and votes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>.</p><p>Lower speeds.

The measure is championed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and backed by a coalition of local officials. On May 15, 2024, a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins called for swift passage before the session ends in June. The letter states, 'The state Legislature should pass the law before the end of this session in June, which could pivot transportation funding toward more beneficial uses like mass transit and biking and walking infrastructure.' Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key recipient. The bill would force agencies to prioritize projects for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders over highway expansion. Advocates argue this shift will save lives, cut pollution, and undo harms from car-centric planning.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, described as a 'modern maritime port and mixed-use community hub,' aims to overhaul the industrial waterfront with new housing and shipping facilities. Council Member Alexa Avilés, representing District 38, serves as vice chair of the Brooklyn Marine Terminal Taskforce, leading community engagement. The plan includes an $80 million city investment and a $15 million state investment in cold storage to reduce truck traffic. Rep. Jerry Nadler criticized the move, warning that shrinking the Red Hook Container Port could increase truck traffic and harm jobs. The final vision will be shaped by community input.

Lives at stake.</p><p class=mb3>Bill A4120/S1981 aims to cut vehicle miles traveled in New York by 20% by 2050. On May 15, 2024, more than a dozen local officials sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, urging passage before session’s end in June. The letter, organized by Local Progress, states: 'This means projects that expanded cycling infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, and public transit were prioritized over outdated highway expansions and lane widening.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill. Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.' The bill would force planners to consider car miles in every project, shifting focus from car movement to safer, people-first streets. The policy could help undo decades of harm from highways that split communities and reinforce segregation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Susan Zhuang leads, joined by Rivera, Gennaro, Won, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Louis, Cabán, Restler, Farías, Banks, Riley, and Feliz. The bill orders the Department of Transportation to paint and hang school safety signs on every street with a school entrance. The goal: alert drivers to children and pedestrians.
