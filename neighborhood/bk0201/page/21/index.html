The rest lived, hurt.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks>Where the street breaks</h3><p>Cadman Plaza West is a wound. It leads the map for this area with injuries and a death. The city’s own data marks it a hotspot <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>on Cadman Plaza West</a>. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>BQE</a> is worse by volume and took a life too. Afternoon hours hit hardest here: injuries stack from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., with deaths logged at 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. in the historical record.</p><p>A 76‑year‑old woman died in 2022 on Cadman Plaza West. The police file lists “Unsafe Speed.” It also lists “Aggressive Driving/Road Rage.” She was trapped in the wreckage. The driver, 60, was injured. It is all in the city’s data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>for that crash</a>.</p><p>In 2023, a 48‑year‑old driver died on the BQE. The file says “Lost Consciousness.” Two vehicles. Impact at speed. It sits in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>BQE record</a>.</p><p>This summer, another driver died on Henry Street. A parked Mini. A Mazda sedan going straight. The woman was 58, marked “Apparent Death” in the log. The entry is dry and final.

Forty‑eight injured since 2022, with a serious injury on record. Sedans are the main strike vehicle for people on foot—22 pedestrian injuries traced to them, with one serious. Trucks follow with seven.

The council file is here: <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Res 1024‑2025</a>.</p><p>Restler also co‑sponsors a law to make DOT install school‑zone safety devices within 60 days after a study.

He also advanced a bill to force speed limiters on repeat dangerous drivers.

Then Adams at Fulton. Daylight the crosswalks. Harden the turns. Give pedestrians a head start. Use cameras to keep bus lanes, bike lanes, and crosswalks clear—what <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Res 1024‑2025</a> seeks to unlock. Install school‑front safety fast under <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1353‑2025</a>.</p><p>Across the city, lower the default speed limit and rein in repeat speeders. The legislature already renewed school‑zone cameras through 2030, as covered by <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog</a>. The next step is passing speed limiters for the worst drivers—tracked in committee and votes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>.</p><p>Lower speeds.

State Senator Andrew Gounardes moves to reauthorize the city’s speed camera program.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2022, public debate erupted over speed camera enforcement and evasion technologies. The issue centers on a new app, NYC SpeedCamBuster, which alerts drivers to speed and red-light cameras, helping them avoid tickets. The matter, titled 'New App Helps Reckless Drivers Thumb Their Noses at City’s Speed Cameras,' drew sharp criticism from safe-streets activists and the NYPD, who called such apps a 'significant public safety concern.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, representing District 26, took action to reauthorize and expand the city’s speed camera program. Advocates Jacob deCastro and Jehiah Czebotar demanded more cameras and stricter enforcement, arguing that cameras save lives and change driver behavior.

The article, titled "New App Helps Reckless Drivers Thumb Their Noses at City’s Speed Cameras," details how the app lets drivers evade enforcement and dispute tickets. Safe-streets groups, including Transportation Alternatives and engineer Jehiah Czebotar, condemned the app. Jacob deCastro of Transportation Alternatives said, "If drivers want to avoid speeding tickets, they simply should not speed." Czebotar added, "Any demand for notifications to help drivers avoid speed cameras is proof that actually enforcing the speed limit does change driver behavior for the better." The NYPD warned that such apps undermine public safety. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes is pushing to reauthorize and expand the speed camera program. The app, and others like it, threaten vulnerable road users by making streets less safe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill summary states: 'New York City officials are in conflict with state lawmakers in Albany over the future of school speed zone cameras.' Gounardes is confident in renewal. Mayor Eric Adams and advocates want home rule for NYC on speed cameras and speed limits, but Albany resists.

The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo.

The bill was proposed on March 29, 2022. It is currently under consideration in committee. The measure’s summary states it would mandate 'directed training with a professional.' Gounardes called out the current system, linking lack of experience to crashes and road violence. Carroll said professional training means better drivers. The bill has backing from the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools and the city Department of Transportation. Both stress the need for real training to protect all road users. The DMV has not commented. The bill aims to close deadly gaps in driver preparation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill was announced on March 29, 2022. Gounardes slammed the current rules as too lenient, saying, "For some drivers, the first time they take the wheel [as a licensed driver] they are in sole control of their car." Carroll called the requirement "reasonable." Stephen Walling, president of the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools, said the bill would "go a long way towards keeping all New Yorkers safer on our roads." The NYC Department of Transportation called driver education "crucial" for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users, and is reviewing the proposal.

The event spotlighted the city’s struggle to control its own traffic laws. Adams slammed state rules that force red light and speed cameras off between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., calling it 'unbelievable.' He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year. The mayor pressed for 24/7 camera operation and renewed NYPD focus. The council and advocates demand Albany act before more lives are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams criticized the law that forces cameras off at 10 p.m., asking, 'Who are we protecting? We're protecting the speeders?' He cited clear data showing cameras cut violations and crashes. State Senator Andrew Gounardes echoed Adams, questioning why lawmakers outside the city control local street safety. Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement has dropped and pledged to prioritize it. Advocates argue enforcement alone is not enough and call for street redesigns to protect pedestrians and cyclists. Traffic deaths remain high, especially when cameras are off.
