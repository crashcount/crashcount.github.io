Eleven are seriously hurt.</strong> In Woodside, from 2022 to June 2025, the street is a wound that will not close. <strong>Crashes do not stop.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 224 people were injured. Three were left with injuries that will mark them for life. Not one death in the past year, but the memory of loss lingers. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-relentless-and-unchanged>The Pattern: Relentless and Unchanged</h3><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, mopeds.</strong> They strike bodies and break them. Two killed by SUVs. One by a truck. One by a motorcycle. Pedestrians, cyclists, riders—all at risk. The numbers do not care if you are young or old. In the last year, 11 children were hurt. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-waiting>Leadership: Promises and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They point to new laws—<strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders. But in Woodside, the street stays the same. <strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> The council can lower the limit to 20 mph. They have not. The state can keep speed cameras running. They have not acted fast enough. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Cameras can be kept on. But only if leaders act. Only if people demand it. The cost of waiting is written in broken bodies and empty chairs.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The session saw progressives sidelined as the Council prioritized car-centric bills, including Intros 103 and 104 (parking protection) and hearings on Intro 606 (e-bike registration). The Common Sense Caucus, known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, led the charge. Progressive members lost key committee seats. Universal daylighting (Intro 1138) and other safety reforms stalled. Council Member Julie Won continued to push for daylighting but faced resistance. As Streetsblog reported, 'roadway safety is simply not a priority.' Advocates and former members criticized the Council for failing to hold the mayor accountable on the Streets Master Plan and for focusing on parking over safety. The Council's actions marked a retreat from previous street safety gains, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates say the report ignores proven safety gains in other cities.</p><p class=mb3>On January 18, 2025, the Department of Transportation released a report challenging the safety benefits of universal daylighting, as a City Council bill requiring it gained momentum. The report, discussed in the Transportation Committee, found higher injury rates at intersections where parking is banned, but DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton, admitted they could not prove daylighting causes more injuries. The matter summary states: 'Universal daylighting, as evidenced in DOT’s hydrant zone analysis, does not have the widespread safety benefits anticipated and may have negative effects on safety.' Councilmember Julie Won, the bill’s sponsor, argued, 'That could've been prevented with universal daylighting,' referencing children killed by traffic violence. The bill has 20 co-sponsors. Advocates and researchers, including Marcel Moran and Alex Morano, criticized the report’s lack of data and focus on negatives, noting no city has improved safety by blocking visibility. The report’s timing drew skepticism as cities like San Francisco and Hoboken have seen safety gains from daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now under council debate, follows a DOT study required by earlier council legislation. The study’s summary: 'simply removing parking or adding signage had little or even negative impact on safety, with injury rates 30% higher at intersections with only hydrant zones.' Won said, 'Daylighting must be supplemented with hardened barriers like planters and boulders.' DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton warned that sign-only daylighting can actually increase danger by letting drivers speed through wider turns. Advocates and DOT officials agree: daylighting without physical barriers fails to protect. The bill’s fate now rests with the council and the mayor’s pledge to daylight 1,000 intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
