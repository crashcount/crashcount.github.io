Eleven are seriously hurt.</strong> In Woodside, from 2022 to June 2025, the street is a wound that will not close. <strong>Crashes do not stop.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 224 people were injured. Three were left with injuries that will mark them for life. Not one death in the past year, but the memory of loss lingers. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-relentless-and-unchanged>The Pattern: Relentless and Unchanged</h3><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, mopeds.</strong> They strike bodies and break them. Two killed by SUVs. One by a truck. One by a motorcycle. Pedestrians, cyclists, riders—all at risk. The numbers do not care if you are young or old. In the last year, 11 children were hurt. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-waiting>Leadership: Promises and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They point to new laws—<strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders. But in Woodside, the street stays the same. <strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> The council can lower the limit to 20 mph. They have not. The state can keep speed cameras running. They have not acted fast enough. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Cameras can be kept on. But only if leaders act. Only if people demand it. The cost of waiting is written in broken bodies and empty chairs.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Cyclists and walkers remain crammed together. Council Member Julie Won called out the danger. DOT blames supply chain woes. Lives hang in the balance while cars keep their lanes.</p><p class=mb3>On May 23, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced at a City Council hearing that the dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge would be delayed until at least mid-2024. This is the fourth delay for the project, which was originally promised by the end of 2022. The matter, discussed in the Council, centers on transforming the south outer roadway from a car lane into a pedestrian path, giving cyclists sole access to the north outer roadway. Council Member Julie Won (D-Astoria) expressed frustration, stating, 'It was announced that it would be open in 2022 ... and last year you said that it may be 2024. You now have a delayed update again.' Won highlighted the life-and-death risk for vulnerable users forced to share a narrow, overcrowded path. DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione cited supply chain issues, especially with paint, as the reason for the delay, but refused to cede a car lane, citing traffic concerns. Advocacy group Bike New York's Jon Orcutt urged the city to test weekend closures for cars. The delay keeps pedestrians and cyclists in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers want more frequent, reliable, and affordable transit. They warn of a looming fiscal cliff. Without action, riders face service cuts. The vote backs millions who depend on buses and trains.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0460-2023 was adopted by the City Council on April 27, 2023, after review by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The site has seen 103 crashes and 47 injuries since 2020. Council Member Julie Won responded, calling the fatality 'another senseless death that could have been prevented with traffic calming measures and street redesigns.' Won urged the Department of Transportation to 'take immediate action to redesign this intersection to prevent further injuries and death.' The council member’s statement highlights the urgent need for safer streets for all users—pedestrians, cyclists, and moped riders. The intersection’s deadly record underscores systemic failure.

One light will not fix the corridor.</p><p class=mb3>On April 1, 2023, NYC DOT announced a new traffic signal for 45th Street and Newtown Road in Queens. This follows the February death of Dolma Naadhun, age 7, struck by a driver with a learner’s permit. The matter, titled 'NYC to install a traffic signal at the site of Queens crash that killed 7-year-old,' drew support from State Sen. Michael Gianaris, who said, 'I am glad the city is installing a traffic signal at the site of Naadhun's tragic death, in accordance with her family’s wishes.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'No loss of life on our streets is acceptable.' The DOT has already added curb extensions and new crosswalks. Community members, including Alex Duncan, argue that one signal is not enough and demand systemic safety changes along the corridor. The signal is set for installation in May.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency will install a traffic light by May, following a petition from Dolma’s brother and pressure from local leaders. State Senator Michael Gianaris, representing District 12, pledged to honor the family's request, stating, 'We fix Newtown Road where this happened.' The DOT will also add all-way stop signs at a nearby crossing and has already improved crosswalks, extended curbs, and restricted parking for better visibility. The driver in the fatal crash ran a stop sign and lacked a proper license. The city’s action comes after years of complaints about dangerous driving at this intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
