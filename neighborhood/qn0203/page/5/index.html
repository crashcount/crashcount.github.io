It keeps growing.</p><h3 id=queens-boulevard-and-roosevelt-names-on-a-map-bodies-on-the-line>Queens Boulevard and Roosevelt: names on a map, bodies on the line</h3><p>Queens Boulevard logs two deaths and 54 injuries. Roosevelt Avenue holds one death and 35 injuries. Together they tell one story: speed and mass win; flesh loses.</p><p>A 42‑year‑old on a motorcycle died on Queens Boulevard after contact with a box truck on Aug. 10, 2022. The record shows ejection and crush injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> marks it as fatal (CrashID 4554092).</p><p>A 38‑year‑old man, walking outside a crosswalk at Roosevelt and 70th, was struck and killed by a 2011 Ford SUV before dawn on Apr. 23, 2024. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> logs the pedestrian as “Apparent Death” (CrashID 4719380).</p><p>On the BQE, a 33‑year‑old pedestrian died on July 13, 2023. The file lists “Internal” injuries after a Ford SUV going straight. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> records the fatality (CrashID 4646702). The corridor is our top injury hotspot.</p><p>These are not accidents. They are impacts. They happen where the map already glows red: <a href=#>Queens Boulevard</a> and <a href=#>Roosevelt Avenue</a> in our dataset’s top intersections, and the <a href=#>BQE</a> that cuts through it.</p><h3 id=when-and-why-it-happens>When and why it happens</h3><p>Harm spikes at the edges of day. Injuries stack at 8 a.m., 9 a.m., and again from late afternoon into night. Deaths hit at 5 a.m., 6 a.m., 4 p.m., and 10 p.m., then keep coming through the evening, per the hourly distribution.</p><p>What drives the damage here: “other” factors dominate with 2 deaths and 210 injuries. Pedestrian or cyclist “error” appears in the log too, but the bodies show the power imbalance: SUVs are tied to two pedestrian deaths and 48 pedestrian injuries; trucks add nine more pedestrian hits. The vehicle rollup is blunt: cars and SUVs account for the largest share of harm to people on foot.</p><p>On Aug. 7, 2025 at 69th Street and Woodside Avenue, a U‑turning sedan with Oklahoma plates met a southbound Harley. The rider, 62, went down with crush injuries to his leg. The log cites failure to yield. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> fixes the time and place (CrashID 4833478).</p><h3 id=promises-pressure-and-the-slow-road-to-change>Promises, pressure, and the slow road to change</h3><p>Leaders can move when they are pressed. The Queensboro Bridge finally split people walking from people biking in May 2025 after months of delay. “After years of advocacy… [complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths],” said State Senator Michael Gianaris, while noting the unexplained holdup. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-completes-long-stalled-plan-to-separate-bikes-and-pedestrians-on-queensboro-bridge>Gothamist</a>. In April, electeds warned City Hall that further delay would “unnecessarily put at risk” thousands who still shared a cramped lane. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>At the state level, Albany moved on chronic speeders. Senator Gianaris voted yes in committee for S4045 to require intelligent speed assistance for drivers who pile up violations. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>. Assembly Member Steven Raga co‑sponsors the Assembly version. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">Open States</a>.</p><p>City Council also pushed to clear illegal blockers. A resolution urges Albany to pass A.5440 to ticket owner‑liability parking violations by camera, with Raga tied to the state bill and Council Member Lincoln Restler sponsoring the resolution. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-make-woodside-safer-now>What would make Woodside safer now</h3><p>Start at the hot corridors.</p><ul><li>Harden turns and add daylighting on Queens Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue. Protect the crosswalks drivers hit again and again. Use failure‑to‑yield stings where the log shows turning conflicts.</li><li>Build physical separation and traffic calming near the BQE ramps and frontage, where one death and 199 injuries cluster. Keep speed down before the merge.</li><li>Target repeat hotspots at 69th Street and Woodside Avenue with no‑U‑turn controls and curb work. The Aug. 7 crash tells you why.</li></ul><p>Then finish the citywide work.</p><ul><li>Lower speeds everywhere. Sammy’s Law gave NYC the power to set slower limits. A citywide 20 mph default cuts force at the point of impact.</li><li>Fit chronic violators with speed limiters. S4045/A7979 is built for the 1.5% who do the worst harm.</li></ul><p>This neighborhood’s file is already thick. The numbers do not grieve. People do.</p><p>If you want it to stop, start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Helmet cam footage showed Rosen rear-ending the motorcycle, causing it to catch fire and kill McField instantly. Queens DA Melinda Katz stated, "As alleged, this defendant plowed his BMW SUV into a motorcyclist shortly after the two had a minor collision." The BMW also struck another car before stopping.

Faster boarding slashes dwell times. Riders save time. Streets get safer, air gets cleaner. The city must weigh the cost—and the gains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2025, a policy analysis by Charles Komanoff examined the impact of fare-free buses in New York City. The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips. The report adds fuel to the debate over city funding for free bus service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project sits finished. Cyclists and walkers still cram into a narrow, crash-prone lane. Delays keep thousands at risk. City Hall stalls. Advocates plan protest. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors said Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and struck Justin Diaz, 23, who had the right-of-way. Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly double the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The article states, 'Pena was driving nearly 60 mph above the speed limit after a night of drinking at a bar.' Surveillance footage confirmed the sequence. Two passengers in Pena's car were hospitalized.
