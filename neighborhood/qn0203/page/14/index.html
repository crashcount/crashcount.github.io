Eleven are seriously hurt.</strong> In Woodside, from 2022 to June 2025, the street is a wound that will not close. <strong>Crashes do not stop.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 224 people were injured. Three were left with injuries that will mark them for life. Not one death in the past year, but the memory of loss lingers. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-relentless-and-unchanged>The Pattern: Relentless and Unchanged</h3><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, mopeds.</strong> They strike bodies and break them. Two killed by SUVs. One by a truck. One by a motorcycle. Pedestrians, cyclists, riders—all at risk. The numbers do not care if you are young or old. In the last year, 11 children were hurt. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-waiting>Leadership: Promises and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They point to new laws—<strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders. But in Woodside, the street stays the same. <strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> The council can lower the limit to 20 mph. They have not. The state can keep speed cameras running. They have not acted fast enough. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Cameras can be kept on. But only if leaders act. Only if people demand it. The cost of waiting is written in broken bodies and empty chairs.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill sought to amend city law by establishing a parking permit enforcement unit within the Department of Transportation. Its summary reads: 'This bill would require the Department of Transportation to create a parking permit enforcement unit that would be dedicated to the enforcement of laws and rules relating to misuse of city-issued parking permits.' The primary sponsor was Kristin Richardson Jordan, joined by Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Julie Won, Rita C. Joseph, Crystal Hudson, Farah N. Louis, and Lincoln Restler. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. No safety analyst assessed its impact on vulnerable road users.

The incident, which killed 74-year-old Be Tran at Myrtle and Seneca Avenues, triggered public outcry. Gianaris criticized the city’s process, saying, 'They have to wait until that happens to get the score high enough to realize that an intersection needs protection.' He joined activists from the Ridgewood Tenants Union and Transportation Alternatives, demanding new signals and better street design. Gianaris said he contacted the Department of Transportation a year earlier with no result. The city claims over 20 traffic control approvals in Ridgewood, but residents and advocates say it’s not enough.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0604-2022 was introduced on August 11, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to 'establish priority for sidewalk repairs at developments operated by the New York City Housing Authority,' giving first priority to senior-only NYCHA buildings, then to other NYCHA sites. Emergencies at non-NYCHA properties could override this order, with required notification to local officials. The bill required DOT to report on completed and pending NYCHA sidewalk repairs by June 30, 2023. Council Member Alexa Avilés sponsored the bill, joined by Abreu, Brooks-Powers, Restler, Hanif, Won, Nurse, Gutiérrez, and Sanchez. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without enactment. Sidewalk hazards at NYCHA developments persist, leaving vulnerable residents exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) delayed the conversion of the South Outer Roadway to a full-time pedestrian path until at least the end of 2023, citing ongoing bridge repairs. The shared path, only 11 feet wide, is far below DOT’s own safety standards. Injuries have increased as usage soars—nine cyclists hurt in three years, up from three. Julie Won said, "People walking or biking on the shared path are paying with bloody pavement and broken bones, all so the DOT can promote car travel for the few." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the project is a priority, but the city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed. Nine lanes for cars, half a lane each for people. The danger is real and rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
