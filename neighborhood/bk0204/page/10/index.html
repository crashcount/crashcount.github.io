A Ford Explorer hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. No one has been arrested. Police said it was the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn that week. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>Witnesses told police the driver of the Ford Explorer sped off without stopping.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, one person died and four suffered serious injuries in Clinton Hill. There were 147 injuries from 246 crashes. The dead and wounded are not numbers. They are neighbors—people who crossed the street and did not come home.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p>SUVs killed or seriously injured more pedestrians than any other vehicle in Clinton Hill. In the last three years, SUVs were involved in every pedestrian death. Cars, trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left people hurt. No one is safe. Children, the elderly, and working people all show up in the numbers. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But the speed limit on most streets is still 25 mph. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners need Albany to keep them alive. The city has the power to lower speeds now. It has not used it. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act or do not act. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Tell them to build streets where people can cross and live. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets next to commercial, office, or retail zones would be exempt. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance.

The group, led by Gib Veconi, demands the Adams administration finish the Underhill Avenue bike boulevard and support the Vanderbilt Avenue open street. Council Member Crystal Hudson called for daylighting all intersections within a half-mile of a school, covering all 54 intersections. The matter summary states, 'No intersections in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, are clear of parked cars as required under state law.' Veconi and the council cite recent pedestrian deaths, including a 7-year-old killed by an NYPD tow truck driver whose view was blocked by parked cars. The mayor’s office has delayed safety projects, citing outreach concerns. Residents and advocates say the city’s exemption from state daylighting law leaves streets unsafe, with 180 crashes and 75 injuries reported this year.

The incident, reported on November 3, 2023, highlights Adams’ reversal on key safety policies, including ending the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program and abandoning a planned bike lane on Ashland Place. The Department of Transportation briefly removed a car-free Open Street in Fort Greene, a move traced to City Hall. Councilmember Crystal Hudson, representing District 35, criticized the administration for failing to fill 483 vacant crossing guard positions and for lax speeding enforcement, stating her precinct has 'a long waiting list and not enough crossing guards.' Despite Adams’ claims of 1,000 street redesigns and ongoing efforts, the administration has missed City Council-mandated goals for protected bike and bus lanes. Cycling deaths are at their highest since 2014. DOT touts a record low in pedestrian fatalities and daylighting redesigns, but residents and Hudson say many intersections remain unsafe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents demanded speed bumps and crossing guards. The crash came as the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and crossing guard positions were cut.

The project, led by the Department of Transportation, aimed to create a protected bike lane from the Manhattan Bridge to Barclays Center. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso said, "New York City is regressing on meeting its Vision Zero goals ... and stalled street safety improvements, like those slated for Ashland Place, are a part of the reason why." State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety. City Hall deflected, blaming e-bikes for rising cyclist deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) ended contractor support in spring 2023, citing a shift of resources to higher-need areas and the street's ineligibility for the Public Space Equity Program. The matter summary states, 'A block-long "open street"...ended in spring 2023 after the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) reassigned its contractor elsewhere.' Council Member Crystal Hudson did not comment on the closure. Volunteers, including Phillip Kellogg, Brian Blessinger, and Mike Lydon, voiced frustration and burnout, highlighting the failure of relying on unpaid labor for public safety. No significant local opposition existed.

The plan, discussed for over ten years, aims to transform Atlantic Avenue from a car-dominated corridor into a safer, mixed-use area. The report, described as 'exhaustive' by Council Member Crystal Hudson, highlights community demands for deeply affordable housing, safer streets, and better infrastructure. Hudson stated, 'the community surrounding Atlantic Avenue has called for a new vision for this dangerous corridor.' The plan identifies needs like bike boulevards, raised crosswalks, and wider sidewalks. However, the Department of Transportation raised concerns about protected bike lanes due to truck traffic.
