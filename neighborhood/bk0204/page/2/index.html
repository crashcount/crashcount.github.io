A Ford Explorer hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. No one has been arrested. Police said it was the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn that week. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>Witnesses told police the driver of the Ford Explorer sped off without stopping.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, one person died and four suffered serious injuries in Clinton Hill. There were 147 injuries from 246 crashes. The dead and wounded are not numbers. They are neighbors—people who crossed the street and did not come home.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p>SUVs killed or seriously injured more pedestrians than any other vehicle in Clinton Hill. In the last three years, SUVs were involved in every pedestrian death. Cars, trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left people hurt. No one is safe. Children, the elderly, and working people all show up in the numbers. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But the speed limit on most streets is still 25 mph. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners need Albany to keep them alive. The city has the power to lower speeds now. It has not used it. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act or do not act. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Tell them to build streets where people can cross and live. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
