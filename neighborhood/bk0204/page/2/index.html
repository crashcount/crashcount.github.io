In the last three years, SUVs were involved in every pedestrian death. Cars, trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left people hurt. No one is safe.

The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But the speed limit on most streets is still 25 mph. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners need Albany to keep them alive. The city has the power to lower speeds now. It has not used it. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act or do not act. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Tell them to build streets where people can cross and live. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure now returns to the City Planning Commission before a full Council vote.

Councilmembers Chi Ossé (District 36) and Crystal Hudson support the plan, which includes $215 million for infrastructure, tenant protections, and workforce development. Ossé said, 'We are taking on that challenge' of housing scarcity. The plan funds a comprehensive redesign of Atlantic Avenue, focusing on major intersections and bike infrastructure, plus upgrades to playgrounds and subway access. These changes target systemic street danger, aiming to protect pedestrians and cyclists in a corridor long plagued by crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, 'Monday’s Headlines: NYPD Bike Crackdown Edition,' revealed that the crackdown would sweep 14 corridors across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the policy 'incredibly misguided' and 'unacceptable.' MSNBC’s Chris Hayes called it 'outrageous' and warned it targets immigrant delivery cyclists. The New York Civil Liberties Union warned of amplified racially targeted policing. The safety analyst notes: 'Criminalizing common cycling violations places undue burdens on cyclists, discourages cycling, and may reduce mode shift, ultimately undermining safety in numbers and street equity for vulnerable road users.'

The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low.
