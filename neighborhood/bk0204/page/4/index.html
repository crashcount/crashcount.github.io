So is <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Classon Avenue</a>. Fulton Street and Washington Avenue follow.</p><p>The clock tells its own truth. Injuries spike at school and commute hours: 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. carry dozens of hurt. Mid‑afternoon is worse. At 3 p.m., sixty‑eight injuries. At 2 p.m. and 1 p.m., near fifty each. Deaths show up at 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. The hours are stamped in the ledger. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s counts don’t flinch</a>.</p><h3 id=what-causes-the-hurt>What causes the hurt</h3><p>The numbers point at hands on wheels. “Driver inattention/distraction.” “Failure to yield.” “Aggressive driving.” “Unsafe speed.” Mechanical failure barely registers. In these years, pedestrians took 91 injuries and one death. Cyclists took 115 injuries. SUV and car fronts do most of the damage. That is all in the city’s rollup. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data lays it out</a>.</p><p>A state dataset shows the dead by age. Two people 55–64 died in the first half of this year in this area. Total crashes are up more than 60% year‑over‑year to 233 by mid‑June. Injuries up more than 50%. These are not curves. They are people. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The period stats are public</a>.</p><h3 id=police-van-red-light-a-man-dragged>Police van. Red light. A man dragged.</h3><p>On Eastern Parkway in 2022, an NYPD van sped, ran a red, and hit Ronald Smith. The van dragged him 35 to 40 feet. The state Attorney General released the video. His sister spoke after. “These officers drove an NYPD van so fast and recklessly&mldr; they dragged my brother&mldr; and had no regard for my brother’s life.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/12/19/video-shows-cop-speeding-in-nypd-van-and-suggests-he-was-watching-a-soccer-game-before-fatal-crash>Read the AG release coverage</a>.

The city has the cameras running all day. Survivors keep pleading. The action items are not secrets. Our own guide shows how to push your council member and the mayor to set safer speeds and back limits on repeat speeders. <a href=/take_action/>Take action here</a>.</p><p>“Repeat speeders keep killing people in our district,” say sponsors of a bill to force speed limiters on the worst drivers. The Senate version moved in June. State Sen. Jabari Brisport voted yes in committee. The Assembly version lists local co‑sponsors. The bill would require speed‑limiting tech for drivers with a record of tickets or points. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Read the Senate file</a> and the <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Assembly file</a>.</p><h3 id=a-last-thing-you-cant-unsee>A last thing you can’t unsee</h3><p>At 470 Vanderbilt, the injury note reads “Severe Lacerations.” At Fulton and Washington, the note reads “Crush Injuries.” The forms are short. The pain is not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The files stay up</a>.</p><p>—</p><p>Bold steps save lives. Lower the default speed.

The lawsuit says tying DOT money to immigration crackdowns endangers safety. Projects stall. Streets grow riskier. Immigrants fear reporting crimes. The federal move puts lives on the line.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, New York Attorney General Letitia James led a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration’s move to tie U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) funding to state cooperation with immigration enforcement. The suit, joined by other state attorneys general, challenges an April 24 announcement by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that would cut off funding to states refusing to enforce federal immigration law or maintain diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The matter summary states, 'DOT’s blatant overreach threatens to divert critical resources away from public safety and undermine projects that keep our communities connected and safe.' James and her colleagues argue this policy forces states to choose between billions in infrastructure funds and supporting immigrant communities. They warn that withholding funds will halt vital safety projects, making streets and transit more dangerous. The attorneys general also note that immigrants may avoid reporting crimes if they fear deportation, further undermining public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT delays a promised bike lane. Elected officials and residents demand action. Private interests block progress. Cyclists face crashes and fear. The city shrugs. The gap remains. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2025, a coalition of Brooklyn officials—including Council Members Crystal Hudson, Shahana Hanif, Lincoln Restler, Assembly Members Andrew Gounardes, Jo Anne Simon, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso—sent a letter urging DOT to finish the protected bike lane on Ashland Place. The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
