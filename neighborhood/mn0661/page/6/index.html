The driver, Stanley Manel, had 26 speed camera tickets. He faced minor charges. Officials demand action: lower speed limits, force repeat offenders to install speed controls, and redesign deadly streets. The city’s inaction kills.</p><p class=mb3>On February 25, 2024, after Danielle Aber was killed by a repeat speeding driver in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, a coalition of elected officials demanded sweeping changes. The group—Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez—called for passage of two state bills: one mandating intelligent speed assistance devices for drivers with six or more speeding tickets in a year, and 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let the City Council lower speed limits. Their statement read, 'We’re calling on the New York State legislature to pass two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence.' They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections, and to convert Nassau and Norman avenues to one-way streets. The officials’ push highlights the deadly gap in accountability and infrastructure that leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident left a 49-year-old woman in critical condition. The driver, Stanley Manel, was arrested and charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. The officials' statement read: 'We’re deeply saddened and outraged at the news of yet another pedestrian being struck by an unsafe driver in Greenpoint.' Restler and colleagues highlighted the intersection's dangers and the driver's history—35 tickets since 2019, including 26 speed camera violations. They urged support for bills requiring speed control devices for repeat offenders and for Sammy’s Law, which would let NYC set its own speed limits. The group called on the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting to protect pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year.

The Department of Transportation's new plan, described as a 'compromised version,' adds protected bike lanes but keeps two car lanes during peak hours from Calyer Street to the Pulaski Bridge. The matter, titled 'Relief in Greenpoint as compromise reached on McGuinness Boulevard redesign,' reflects years of advocacy for safer streets. Restler, along with Borough President Reynoso and others, welcomed the changes and pledged to push for swift implementation. Advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe criticized the compromise as 'less effective and less safe,' blaming business opposition for watering down the original plan. The compromise marks a partial win for vulnerable road users, but falls short of the full road diet advocates demanded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No one is satisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, Mayor Adams announced a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious Brooklyn corridor. The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident happened near Meeker Avenue, one block from where teacher Matthew Jensen was killed in 2021. The matter, titled 'Locals call for mayor to take immediate action after moped rider injured on McGuinness Boulevard,' highlights the urgent need for the Department of Transportation’s proposed safety redesign. Restler, along with U.S. Rep.

They argue EVs cut smog, so drivers deserve a break. Critics warn this move keeps streets clogged. Fewer cars mean fewer crashes.

They urged a congestion pricing discount for electric vehicles, claiming EVs 'do not contribute significantly to the smog and pollution of the Central Business District.' Assembly Member Bores led the effort, stating, 'when it comes to the environmental case, an electric vehicle is just a different profile than a gas-guzzling one.' The officials oppose credits for bridge and tunnel crossings. Congestion pricing advocates and environmental groups counter that EV discounts undermine the core goal: fewer cars, less traffic, safer streets. They note other cities are ending such breaks. The proposal highlights a tension—cleaner air versus safer, less crowded roads for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
