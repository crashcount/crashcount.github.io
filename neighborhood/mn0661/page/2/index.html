The proposal, discussed at a heated community board meeting, remains active and is set for installation after summer repaving. Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas endorsed the plan in a letter, stating it would 'protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.' DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward. Safety analysts note: 'Protected bike lanes are proven to reduce injuries and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians, encourage mode shift, and improve street equity by reallocating space from cars to vulnerable users.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay risky.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit (2025-06-19) reports that despite Mayor Eric Adams's proposal for a 15 mph speed limit on e-bikes, shops in Manhattan still advertise illegal speed modifications. Adams admits the plan is 'an idea' needing state approval and a lengthy rulemaking process. Critics like Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives call the proposal 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' arguing it unfairly targets cyclists while drivers face lesser consequences for greater harm. Janet Schroeder of the NYC E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the limit will matter without enforcement: 'The 15 mph speed limit does nothing.' The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor infractions. The article highlights the policy gap and enforcement challenges, with no immediate relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The vehicles will not operate autonomously; human drivers will remain behind the wheel, as state law forbids fully driverless cars. Waymo is lobbying for a law change to allow autonomous operation, but the effort has stalled in the State Assembly. Mayoral spokeswoman Sophia Askari said, "Public safety is our first priority, which is why we have strong guardrails and requirements in place on any sort of autonomous vehicles." The city’s Department of Transportation is reviewing Waymo’s permit application, the first under the new Autonomous Vehicle Demonstration or Testing Permit Program. The article highlights the tension between technological ambition and regulatory caution, with policy decisions pending and no driverless operation allowed yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Delivery workers swap illegal bikes for certified ones. Fires drove action. But only a few get help. Confusion and mixed signals rule the streets. Riders remain exposed. Systemic danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the Adams administration launched the NYC e-bike trade-in program. No bill number or committee is listed, but the $2-million program stems from a 2023 bill by Council Member Keith Powers. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'The Adams administration is both cracking down on e-bikes and providing safer e-bikes to workers.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'This is not just about protecting delivery workers. It’s about protecting them, their families, their neighbors, and all New Yorkers from deadly fires.' Delivery worker William Medina praised the program, but called for expansion. The program lets workers trade uncertified bikes or illegal mopeds for certified e-bikes, but covers only a fraction of the city’s 80,000 delivery workers. The safety analyst notes: Cracking down may burden vulnerable users, while safer bikes help; mixed signals mean no clear safety gain. The city’s approach leaves vulnerable road users in limbo.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city moves closer to safer, faster streets for people.</p><p class=mb3>On June 12, 2025, Manhattan Community Board 6 passed a resolution supporting DOT’s 34th Street busway plan by a 31-5 vote. The matter, as reported by Streetsblog NYC, reads: 'Manhattan Community Board 6 overwhelmingly supported by a vote of 31-5 the DOT's plans to install a busway on 34th Street, passing a resolution that urged the city to prioritize its installation.' Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, who represent the corridor, both support the measure. The resolution urges the city to prioritize the busway, which would ban through traffic by private cars between Third and Ninth avenues. Leadership from Community Boards 4 and 5 also joined the call. DOT plans to implement the busway in summer or fall 2025. According to the safety analyst, the event text does not describe a policy or legislative change relevant to pedestrian or cyclist safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
