Rep. Velázquez vows court fight. Council Member Julie Won joins call for activism. Panel slams rollback of protections. The crowd demands action to defend New Yorkers from federal threats.</p><p class=mb3>On February 20, 2025, Rep. Nydia Velázquez led a Queens town hall to rally opposition against Trump Administration policies, including the federal move to block New York City's congestion pricing plan. The event, held at Sunnyside Community Services, featured Council Member Julie Won (District 26) and other local officials. The panel condemned the rollback of protections for immigrants and the firing of NLRB board member Gwynne A. Wilcox. Velázquez declared, 'We’ll see him in court,' after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revoked federal approval for congestion pricing. She pledged to fight budget cuts targeting vulnerable communities and criticized tax breaks for the wealthy. Julie Won joined the call for grassroots activism. The town hall spotlighted the threat to New York’s sovereignty and the urgent need to defend city streets and programs from federal interference.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas.

The $2 million program offers bikes and spare batteries, but only scratches the surface for the city’s estimated 80,000 delivery workers. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called the effort a step toward safer, cleaner mobility. Applications close February 17.

Student OMNY cards left kids behind. E-vehicle crackdowns sparked debate. Police and National Guard flooded subways. Council Member Keith Powers fought for excluded students. Holden pushed e-bike licensing. Enforcement rose. Vulnerable riders faced shifting rules and uneven access.</p><p class=mb3>This annual review covers 2024 NYC transit policy, with Council Member Keith Powers vocal about student OMNY card exclusions. The review, published December 23, 2024, highlights congestion pricing delays, e-vehicle crackdowns, and increased subway enforcement. The matter notes, 'parents in [Powers'] Manhattan district felt slighted that their kids were left out of the free transportation program.' Powers pressed for fair access, saying, 'we're still hearing from families whose children aren't receiving an OMNY card like their classmates.' Council Member Robert Holden pushed for e-bike licensing, drawing fire from advocates. The review documents a year of policy shifts, enforcement surges, and ongoing fights over who gets safe, affordable transit. Vulnerable riders—students, cyclists, pedestrians—remained at the mercy of city decisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, held during the third annual Fifth Avenue Holiday Open Street, made the avenue car-free between 48th and 57th Streets. The $150 million plan, as described by Madelyn Wils, will reduce traffic lanes from five to three and widen sidewalks between Bryant Park and Central Park. Powers and other officials voiced strong support for prioritizing pedestrians, echoing Levine’s call to 'do better here' and make Fifth Avenue a true pedestrian destination. The redesign aims to reclaim space for people, not cars, and signals a shift toward safer, more vibrant streets for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is under council review as of December 10, 2024. The measure seeks to overhaul regulations that force NYCHA to keep up over 400 sidewalk sheds—spanning 25 miles—often long after repairs finish. The matter summary states, 'reforming parts of the city’s broader shedding regulations that are a poor fit for NYCHA and a nuisance citywide.' Powers and co-sponsor Erik Bottcher aim to reduce shed length, extend inspection cycles, and allow more art and color on scaffolds. Jamie Rubin, NYCHA board head, supports the bill, noting that current rules rob residents of sunlight, safety, and outdoor space. The bill promises to remove unnecessary sheds, reclaim millions in wasted funds, and improve daily life for public housing residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Keith Powers called the move 'surprising' and urged a full return next year. Advocates called it 'frustrating and disappointing.' Mayor Adams had previously praised the program, which boosted sales by $3 million in 2023. The Department of Transportation now touts sidewalk expansion, but the new redesign drops a planned bike lane and may slow buses. Pedestrians and cyclists lose space.

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.
