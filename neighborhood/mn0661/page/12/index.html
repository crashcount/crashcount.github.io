In the United Nations district, the numbers do not lie. Since January 2022, there has been one death and 51 injuries from 88 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). No one under 18 has died, but the wounded span every age. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. A sedan, a taxi, an SUV—these are the machines that break bodies here. In the last year alone, 18 people were hurt. No one was spared serious injury, but the luck will not hold.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-repeat>Patterns That Repeat</h3><p>The violence is not random. Cars turning left on E 45th Street hit a cyclist. A moped driver is struck by an SUV. A 16-year-old passenger is hurt on the FDR. The pattern is always the same: steel against flesh. The cause is always the same: inattention, speed, the city’s indifference. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps, but the pace is slow. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones</a>. Assembly Member Harvey Epstein <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsors bills to require speed limiters for drivers with a record of violations</a>. Council Member Keith Powers has <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>called for using idle congestion pricing cameras for speed and red-light enforcement</a>.</p><p>But the city delays. &ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>said a local board vice chair</a>, as the city cut bike lanes from Fifth Avenue. The machines keep rolling. The bodies keep falling.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just promises.

The driver turned right from 24th Avenue onto 29th Street, hitting Kao and killing her instantly. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani called the crash 'absolutely heartbreaking,' noting Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in Astoria in 2.5 years. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez blamed 'poorly designed streets,' saying, 'traffic violence is the outcome of poorly designed streets and is a solvable problem.' The area has almost no protected bike lanes. In 2022, Community Board 1 saw 1,979 crashes, injuring 120 cyclists and 163 pedestrians.

The push follows prior years when two crosstown blocks were closed to cars to protect pedestrians. The matter, described as 'NYC pols push Eric Adams to bring back Rockefeller Center holiday street closures,' highlights the risk: 'The crowds are just enormous... it’s frankly unsafe to have tourists pushed off the sidewalk and stepping into traffic.' Powers and Levine sent a letter on November 1 but received no response. Powers said, 'The crowds are crushing and demand is overflowing.'

Advocates and officials back the move but call it timid. No wider sidewalks. No hardened protection. Paint and plastic mark the limits. Pedestrians and cyclists still face risk.</p><p class=mb3>On October 18, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation presented a redesign for Third Avenue, reviewed by Community Board 8's Transportation Committee. The plan, echoing a 2010 First Avenue project, repurposes 23 feet for cyclists and bus riders between E. 59th and E. 96th streets. Council Member Keith Powers and Borough President Mark Levine endorsed the proposal, with Levine stating, 'The redesign’s commitment to expanded protected bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes will turn this particularly dangerous stretch of the roadway into a safer, more efficient, and forward-thinking artery.' Still, Levine and advocates like Anna Melendez (Transportation Alternatives) pressed for more: wider sidewalks, hardened pedestrian islands, and real physical protection. The plan uses only paint and plastic, leaving pedestrians exposed. The proposal faces a full board vote on October 19, 2022. The city calls it a start, but the danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in the Board’s Transportation Committee, would convert two of five northbound car lanes into a dedicated bus lane and a parking-protected bike lane, with new pedestrian islands and signal priority. The committee voted 12-1 in favor. Councilmember Keith Powers, representing District 4, supports the overhaul. A spokesperson said, 'This project will expedite commute times, improve pedestrian safety, increase spaces for bikes, and ensure that cars, buses, and bikes can share the road in harmony.' Third Avenue is a Vision Zero priority corridor, scarred by six pedestrian and one cyclist death since 2016. Hundreds of cyclists ride here daily, despite no bike lane.

The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition. Now, the board calls for comprehensive, protected infrastructure to shield vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
