In the United Nations district, the numbers do not lie. Since January 2022, there has been one death and 51 injuries from 88 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). No one under 18 has died, but the wounded span every age. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. A sedan, a taxi, an SUV—these are the machines that break bodies here. In the last year alone, 18 people were hurt. No one was spared serious injury, but the luck will not hold.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-repeat>Patterns That Repeat</h3><p>The violence is not random. Cars turning left on E 45th Street hit a cyclist. A moped driver is struck by an SUV. A 16-year-old passenger is hurt on the FDR. The pattern is always the same: steel against flesh. The cause is always the same: inattention, speed, the city’s indifference. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps, but the pace is slow. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones</a>. Assembly Member Harvey Epstein <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsors bills to require speed limiters for drivers with a record of violations</a>. Council Member Keith Powers has <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>called for using idle congestion pricing cameras for speed and red-light enforcement</a>.</p><p>But the city delays. &ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>said a local board vice chair</a>, as the city cut bike lanes from Fifth Avenue. The machines keep rolling. The bodies keep falling.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just promises.

Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, who represent the corridor, both support the measure. The resolution urges the city to prioritize the busway, which would ban through traffic by private cars between Third and Ninth avenues. Leadership from Community Boards 4 and 5 also joined the call. DOT plans to implement the busway in summer or fall 2025.

The matter reads: 'Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of White Plains; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2030.' Mayer led the push.

The endorsement, reported by Streetsblog NYC and covered by Gersh Kuntzman, followed a review of candidate plans. StreetsPAC called Lander’s proposal 'by far the most comprehensive blueprint ... we've ever seen from a candidate for any office.' Lander promised more protected bike lanes, a citywide Bus Rapid Transit network, and using congestion pricing revenue for busways and bikeways. He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users. Their safety analyst noted: 'A comprehensive plan for safer streets and better public transit typically prioritizes vulnerable road users, supports mode shift, and aligns with best practices for population-level safety improvements.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates call out the city’s misplaced priorities.</p><p class=mb3>On June 10, 2025, Council Member Keith Powers introduced a bill to lower e-bike speed limits to 15 miles per hour, following Mayor Adams’s call for action. The measure, discussed in the Council but not yet assigned a bill number or committee, comes as Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch launches a crackdown on cyclists. Powers said, "I am interested in all measures that might address keeping our street experience here in the city feeling much safer and slowing down any vehicle or device or instrument that could hurt someone." Despite state authority to lower car speed limits, neither the mayor nor the Council act to curb car speeds citywide. Advocates and some officials slam the focus on e-bikes, pointing to data: cars and trucks cause nearly all pedestrian injuries. The safety analyst notes no direct safety impact for vulnerable users, as no specific policy change is enacted. The city’s priorities remain clear—and deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
