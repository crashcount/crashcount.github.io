In the United Nations district, the numbers do not lie. Since January 2022, there has been one death and 51 injuries from 88 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). No one under 18 has died, but the wounded span every age. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. A sedan, a taxi, an SUV—these are the machines that break bodies here.

Cars turning left on E 45th Street hit a cyclist. A moped driver is struck by an SUV. A 16-year-old passenger is hurt on the FDR. The pattern is always the same: steel against flesh. The cause is always the same: inattention, speed, the city’s indifference. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps, but the pace is slow.

The machines keep rolling. The bodies keep falling.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call your state senator.

DOT stands firm. Two killed, 190 injured here since 2020. The street stays dangerous. The fight is over space, speed, and who gets to survive.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-08-08) reports that Astoria businesses sued to stop a DOT project adding protected bike lanes and traffic calming to 31st Street. The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city." The agency says it incorporated feedback from 90% of local businesses.

Both times, she suffered serious injuries. Police never responded. Bike rules go unenforced. Riders flee. Victims are left alone.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit (2025-07-18) reports a 72-year-old woman was hit twice by cyclists on Central Park sidewalks, suffering severe injuries including kidney damage. The NYPD did not respond or file reports in either case. The article notes, 'Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene.' Enforcement of bike regulations in Central Park is rare, despite ongoing crackdowns elsewhere. The Department of Transportation relies on NYPD data, but underreporting skews injury statistics. Policy gaps and lack of follow-up leave vulnerable pedestrians at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
