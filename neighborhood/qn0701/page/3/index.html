Since 2022, College Point logged <strong>4 deaths and 495 injuries across 1,097 crashes</strong>. Eleven were serious. Most were car occupants. One cyclist. One pedestrian. The numbers are from the city’s own database.</p><p>Two of the dead were taken by the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Whitestone Expressway</a>.

Trucks and buses are present, but cars and SUVs dominate the harm.</p><p>Contributing factors skew vague. “Other” leads with 2 deaths and 135 injuries. Failure to yield shows in nine injuries.

McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes."
