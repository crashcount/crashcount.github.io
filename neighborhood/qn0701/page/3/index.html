Progress, setbacks, and hard truths.</p><p class=mb3>The 2024 Streetsie Awards, published December 24, 2024, by Streetsblog NYC, reviewed the year’s transportation policy. The article highlighted both progress and setbacks, stating: 'The 2024 Streetsie Awards by Streetsblog NYC review the year's best and worst in NYC transportation policy, highlighting key events, policies, and political actors.' Key actions included the City Council decriminalizing jaywalking and cutting mandatory parking minimums, though low-density areas were left out. Council Member Lincoln Restler lost his Transportation Committee seat despite pushing for citizen enforcement against illegal parking. Speaker Adrienne Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Mayor Adams were all named for missed promises or weak follow-through. Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch’s crackdown on ghost plates drew praise. The review called out Gov. Hochul for delaying congestion pricing, then reversing course. The NYPD faced criticism for ignoring placard abuse and Vision Zero, and for deadly high-speed chases. The piece underscored the need for accountability and stronger action to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children.

The bill, sponsored by Councilmember Bob Holden, claims to address 'the proliferation of these vehicles' and their impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety. Councilmember Vickie Paladino, District 19, insisted, 'This is a safety issue.' Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez countered, 'We agree with the intent, but we believe that mandating registration and licensing is not a solution.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams warned the bill would 'have a disparate impact on low-income individuals, people of color, and undocumented migrants.' A separate resolution from Councilmember Gale Brewer supports licensing only for commercial e-bikes.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT says the program is safe and popular.</p><p class=mb3>On September 17, 2024, Council Member Sandra Ung announced a bill to ban the Queens e-scooter share program. The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets will change.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0746-2024, now Local Law 94 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 12, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

All were conscious and restrained at the scene. The sedan was damaged at the center back end, while the truck showed no damage.
