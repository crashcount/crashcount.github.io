Harm concentrates at night. Serious injuries peak around 22:00 (about 10 p.m.).</p><p>On 2025-07-02 a 51-year-old driver died on the Cross Island Parkway at Bell Blvd, per city records (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4824810</a>). The parkways cut through Bay Terrace–Clearview. The toll is steady.</p><h3 id=we-already-saw-the-warning>We already saw the warning</h3><p>A wrong-way driver on the Clearview Expressway smashed into other cars and sent people to the hospital. A jury convicted him. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said, “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway and crashed into multiple cars” (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>). The driver told police he entered the expressway the wrong way “because I wanted to hurt people and I felt ‘liberated’ by what I had done” (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>).</p><p>High-speed roads. Human bodies. Metal wins.</p><h3 id=hotspots-and-patterns>Hotspots and patterns</h3><p>Two corridors dominate injuries: <strong>Cross Island Parkway</strong> and <strong>Clearview Expressway</strong>. Nights are worse; many serious injuries happen near 22:00. Common contributing factors are failure-to-yield, inattention/distraction, and other driver errors. Cars and SUVs account for most recorded pedestrian injuries in this period.</p><p>Local, concrete fixes now:</p><ul><li>Daylight crossings and clear sight lines at feeder streets.</li><li>Leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs) at signalized approaches.</li><li>Add targeted nighttime lighting and enforcement at ramps and service roads where crashes cluster.</li><li>Traffic-calming on nearby local streets and hardened turn radii at ramp exits.</li></ul><h3 id=what-leaders-did--and-didnt>What leaders did — and didn’t</h3><p>Council Member Vickie Paladino introduced Int. 1362-2025, which would remove bus- and bike-lane quotas from the Streets Master Plan (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar</a>). That rollback would strip concrete targets for protected lanes.</p><p>State Senator Toby Stavisky voted yes in committee for S 4045, a bill to require intelligent speed-assistance devices for repeat dangerous drivers (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). That is the right target: the worst repeat offenders cause outsized harm.</p><p>Set the local priority plain: keep and expand protected bus and bike lanes; slow cars on local streets; harden ramps and crossings; and force repeat speeders to obey the law.</p><h3 id=citywide-fixes-this-points-to>Citywide fixes this points to</h3><p>Local patterns repeat across NYC. Two citywide moves would cut this harm fast: lower the city’s default speed limit to 20 mph, and require speed limiters (intelligent speed-assistance) for habitual speeders.

The article reports, "On Tuesday, police charged him with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to exercise due care, both misdemeanors." Jean-Baptiste, driving a Dodge Ram, turned left and hit Jimenez as he crossed the busy intersection. Jimenez suffered a massive head injury and died a week later. The driver remained at the scene and was later given a desk appearance ticket. This case highlights persistent risks at major crossings and the delay in holding drivers accountable for failing to yield and exercise care.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets turned dangerous in a blink.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on April 4, 2025, that two separate crashes in Queens left multiple pedestrians injured. In Astoria, a 35-year-old driver 'lost control of her vehicle and went onto the sidewalk, running over two girls, ages 7 and 14.' Police charged her with reckless driving and driving without a license. Later, in South Ozone Park, a 79-year-old driver swerved, sideswiped a bus, then 'jumped the curb and struck four women who were standing at a bus shelter.' All victims survived, but injuries ranged from broken bones to head trauma. The incidents highlight ongoing dangers for pedestrians and raise questions about driver screening and street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, a probationary firefighter, now faces manslaughter charges.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on March 28, 2025, that Michael Pena, a probationary FDNY firefighter, was fired after being charged with vehicular manslaughter in a Queens crash. Prosecutors said Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and struck Justin Diaz, 23, who had the right-of-way. Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly double the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The article states, 'Pena was driving nearly 60 mph above the speed limit after a night of drinking at a bar.' Surveillance footage confirmed the sequence. Two passengers in Pena's car were hospitalized. The crash highlights ongoing risks from impaired and reckless driving, even among public servants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
