Eighty-five injuries. One serious injury.</strong> That is the toll in Yankee Stadium-Macombs Dam Park since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are neighbors, children, workers. In the last year, two children were hurt: a four-year-old struck by a bike, and a teenager hit by a car. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=red-lights-broken-lives>Red Lights, Broken Lives</h3><p>On a Sunday night in June, a 15-year-old boy rode his scooter north on Jerome Avenue. A motorcyclist ran the red at East 167th. The boy was hit, left in the street, and the driver sped away. Police said, “A 15-year-old boy riding his scooter was critically hurt when a Bronx motorcyclist blew through a red light, slammed into him and sped away.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/boy-15-on-scooter-struck-by-hit-and-run-bronx-motorcyclist-critically-hurt/>Police said</a></p><p><strong>No one stopped.

But the law that lets the city set safer speeds—Sammy’s Law—sits unused. The city could lower the speed limit to 20 mph today. It has not. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark if Albany does not act. The streets stay fast. The children stay at risk.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the power they have. Lower the speed. Keep the cameras on.

The letter calls for urgent upgrades to the 133-year-old Washington Bridge. The officials demand a two-way protected bike lane, wider pedestrian paths, improved lighting, and safety cameras. The letter states: 'The city has done a terrific job of making wise investments in improving mobility on both sides of the Harlem River, but left the bridge with just two very narrow, poorly lit lanes for foot and bike traffic.' Stevens and her colleagues stress that the bridge is unsafe for people on foot and bike. They urge DOT to act, citing the need to reduce traffic deaths and make the bridge safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
