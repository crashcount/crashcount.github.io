Eighty-five injuries. One serious injury.</strong> That is the toll in Yankee Stadium-Macombs Dam Park since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are neighbors, children, workers. In the last year, two children were hurt: a four-year-old struck by a bike, and a teenager hit by a car. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=red-lights-broken-lives>Red Lights, Broken Lives</h3><p>On a Sunday night in June, a 15-year-old boy rode his scooter north on Jerome Avenue. A motorcyclist ran the red at East 167th. The boy was hit, left in the street, and the driver sped away. Police said, “A 15-year-old boy riding his scooter was critically hurt when a Bronx motorcyclist blew through a red light, slammed into him and sped away.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/boy-15-on-scooter-struck-by-hit-and-run-bronx-motorcyclist-critically-hurt/>Police said</a></p><p><strong>No one stopped.

But the law that lets the city set safer speeds—Sammy’s Law—sits unused. The city could lower the speed limit to 20 mph today. It has not. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark if Albany does not act. The streets stay fast. The children stay at risk.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the power they have. Lower the speed. Keep the cameras on.

Introduced January 17, 2025, it awaits committee review. The bill summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, and others. No votes have been recorded yet. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving by forcing speed limiters on offenders.
