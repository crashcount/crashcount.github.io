Three seriously hurt.</strong> In Bath Beach, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, <strong>346 people have been injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>One person—a woman, age 81—was killed crossing with the signal</strong> at 15th Avenue and 85th Street. A truck turned left. She did not make it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In the last year, <strong>12 people under 18 were hurt</strong> in crashes. Cyclists and pedestrians take the brunt. The old and the young, the ones walking, the ones riding—these are the bodies that break first.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, mopeds, taxis.</strong> The roll call of harm is long. In the last three years, SUVs and cars were involved in <strong>12 crashes causing moderate or serious injury or death</strong>. Trucks and buses killed one, hurt another. Motorcycles and mopeds left one with a serious injury. Bikes did not kill, but they did not escape harm either. The street is a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No bold moves.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it here. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders have not made Bath Beach a priority.</strong> There are no new protected bike lanes. No major intersection redesigns. The silence is loud. Each day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crossings can be protected. But only if leaders act. Only if neighbors demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action before another life is lost.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.'
