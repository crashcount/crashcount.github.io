Three seriously hurt.</strong> In Bath Beach, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, <strong>346 people have been injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>One person—a woman, age 81—was killed crossing with the signal</strong> at 15th Avenue and 85th Street. A truck turned left. She did not make it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In the last year, <strong>12 people under 18 were hurt</strong> in crashes. Cyclists and pedestrians take the brunt. The old and the young, the ones walking, the ones riding—these are the bodies that break first.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, mopeds, taxis.</strong> The roll call of harm is long. In the last three years, SUVs and cars were involved in <strong>12 crashes causing moderate or serious injury or death</strong>. Trucks and buses killed one, hurt another. Motorcycles and mopeds left one with a serious injury. Bikes did not kill, but they did not escape harm either. The street is a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No bold moves.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it here. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders have not made Bath Beach a priority.</strong> There are no new protected bike lanes. No major intersection redesigns. The silence is loud. Each day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crossings can be protected. But only if leaders act. Only if neighbors demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings.

The driver crashed into a parked car and was arrested at the scene. Two guns were recovered from the vehicle. Both officers were hospitalized for injuries from broken glass. Charges against the driver are pending as the investigation continues. The incident highlights the dangers of traffic stops and the risks posed by armed drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits.

Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, 'The discussion on revenue raisers is definitely going to have to be a part of the MTA.' Senator Steve Chan, District 17, criticized the tax hike, calling it 'a slap on the Brooklyn businesses struggling for survival in my district.'
