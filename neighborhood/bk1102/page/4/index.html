Three seriously hurt.</strong> In Bath Beach, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, <strong>346 people have been injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>One person—a woman, age 81—was killed crossing with the signal</strong> at 15th Avenue and 85th Street.

In the last three years, SUVs and cars were involved in <strong>12 crashes causing moderate or serious injury or death</strong>. Trucks and buses killed one, hurt another. Motorcycles and mopeds left one with a serious injury. Bikes did not kill, but they did not escape harm either. The street is a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No bold moves.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it here. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders have not made Bath Beach a priority.</strong> There are no new protected bike lanes. No major intersection redesigns. The silence is loud. Each day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crossings can be protected. But only if leaders act. Only if neighbors demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action before another life is lost.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Change comes after loss and pressure.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on April 28, 2025, that the city will close a dangerous Bushwick intersection after a fatal crash killed motorcyclist Philippe Haussmann. The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure aims to close a $35 billion hole in the MTA’s five-year capital plan, which covers subway and bus upgrades. The bill has no number yet and remains under negotiation. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, 'The discussion on revenue raisers is definitely going to have to be a part of the MTA.' Senator Steve Chan, District 17, criticized the tax hike, calling it 'a slap on the Brooklyn businesses struggling for survival in my district.' The talks also floated surcharges on for-hire vehicles and online deliveries. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The budget deadline looms.

Danger passed, barely.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (March 9, 2025) reports a near-disaster on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. High winds sent a wooden board flying from a pickup truck into David Deng’s windshield. Dashcam footage shows the board shattering glass across Deng and his family. Deng told the outlet, "I was in complete shock," and described glass covering their clothes and seats. The truck driver had stopped earlier, apparently trying to secure the load. The incident highlights the risk of unsecured cargo on city bridges. No police report was filed at the time. The event underscores the persistent threat loose debris poses to all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash killed Hayden Wallace and injured three others. The driver fled, leaving chaos behind. Police tracked him for over a year. Charges stack up, but the loss remains.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (March 8, 2025) reports that Christopher Seabrook, 28, was arrested after a deadly hit-and-run in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Seabrook had been out on bail for a previous crash involving police. On January 8, 2024, he crashed into a Toyota, killing Hayden Wallace and injuring three others. Seabrook fled the scene, abandoning his vehicle. The article notes, "All accidents are useless but this one was even more useless because [Seabrook] had so many other offenses." Seabrook faces 23 charges, including manslaughter, leaving the scene, unlicensed driving, and speeding. The case highlights repeated driver offenses and questions about bail and enforcement. Police needed over a year to arrest Seabrook, who had a history of fleeing crashes and driving without a license.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
