Three seriously hurt.</strong> In Bath Beach, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, <strong>346 people have been injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>One person—a woman, age 81—was killed crossing with the signal</strong> at 15th Avenue and 85th Street. A truck turned left. She did not make it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In the last year, <strong>12 people under 18 were hurt</strong> in crashes. Cyclists and pedestrians take the brunt. The old and the young, the ones walking, the ones riding—these are the bodies that break first.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, mopeds, taxis.</strong> The roll call of harm is long. In the last three years, SUVs and cars were involved in <strong>12 crashes causing moderate or serious injury or death</strong>. Trucks and buses killed one, hurt another. Motorcycles and mopeds left one with a serious injury. Bikes did not kill, but they did not escape harm either. The street is a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No bold moves.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it here. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders have not made Bath Beach a priority.</strong> There are no new protected bike lanes. No major intersection redesigns. The silence is loud. Each day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crossings can be protected. But only if leaders act. Only if neighbors demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings.

Kagan, who switched parties, opposed congestion pricing and any increase in bus or bike lanes, saying, 'Not more. What they have right now is enough.' Both supported some public transit improvements, but split on how to get there. No formal bill was at stake, but their stances set the tone for the district’s future.

Cyclists and pedestrians get a clear look at danger. The searchable map must show blocked lanes, crash sites, and repairs. No more hiding unsafe streets.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0289-2022, now Local Law 124 of 2023, was enacted by the City Council on September 3, 2023, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The law requires the Department of Transportation to publish a monthly-updated, searchable map of all city bike lanes. The map must show obstructions, construction, crash patterns, shared paths, conflict points, resurfacing, parking, bike share docks, open streets, repair shops, and reporting tools. The bill’s matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to develop a map of bicycle infrastructure conditions.' Council Member Crystal Hudson sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Sanchez, Stevens, Yeger, Restler, Avilés, and others. The law brings sunlight to hidden hazards, giving vulnerable road users the facts they need to see the city’s dangers in plain sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police say the man reversed into Fruchter, who died of head trauma. Council Member Justin Brannan called for confronting traffic violence.

The case is not a council bill but a high-profile enforcement action. Council Member Justin Brannan, District 47, responded to Fruchter's death, tweeting: 'Confronting traffic violence also means taking personal responsibility + safe driving habits. It will take all of us.' The community held a vigil at Owl's Head Park, honoring Fruchter and demanding better traffic safety. Brooklyn leads the city in pedestrian fatalities, with 34% of deaths citywide. The crash site has seen multiple injuries since 2018. Fruchter's legacy and the tragedy highlight ongoing systemic danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
