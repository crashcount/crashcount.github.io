Three seriously hurt.</strong> In Bath Beach, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, <strong>346 people have been injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>One person—a woman, age 81—was killed crossing with the signal</strong> at 15th Avenue and 85th Street. A truck turned left. She did not make it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In the last year, <strong>12 people under 18 were hurt</strong> in crashes. Cyclists and pedestrians take the brunt. The old and the young, the ones walking, the ones riding—these are the bodies that break first.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, mopeds, taxis.</strong> The roll call of harm is long. In the last three years, SUVs and cars were involved in <strong>12 crashes causing moderate or serious injury or death</strong>. Trucks and buses killed one, hurt another. Motorcycles and mopeds left one with a serious injury. Bikes did not kill, but they did not escape harm either. The street is a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No bold moves.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it here. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders have not made Bath Beach a priority.</strong> There are no new protected bike lanes. No major intersection redesigns. The silence is loud. Each day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crossings can be protected. But only if leaders act. Only if neighbors demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings.

The bill’s matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends.

It follows a federal court ruling that found the MTA violated the ADA by skipping elevator installation during renovations. The sponsors demand the MTA use every renovation as a chance to fix this injustice. The bill remains in committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sits in committee. Riders face new rules. Lawmakers push for registration. Streets wait. No change yet. The city debates control. Vulnerable users watch. The system holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0606-2024 was introduced on March 7, 2024, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered," would force all e-bikes, e-scooters, and similar vehicles not already covered by DMV rules to register with the Department of Transportation and display a visible plate. Council Member Inna Vernikov led as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Farías, Riley, Brannan, and many others. The bill was laid over in committee on December 11, 2024. The measure aims to track these vehicles, but its impact on vulnerable road users remains unassessed. The city’s debate continues, with no law yet in force.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
