Three seriously hurt.</strong> In Bath Beach, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, <strong>346 people have been injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>One person—a woman, age 81—was killed crossing with the signal</strong> at 15th Avenue and 85th Street. A truck turned left. She did not make it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In the last year, <strong>12 people under 18 were hurt</strong> in crashes. Cyclists and pedestrians take the brunt. The old and the young, the ones walking, the ones riding—these are the bodies that break first.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, mopeds, taxis.</strong> The roll call of harm is long. In the last three years, SUVs and cars were involved in <strong>12 crashes causing moderate or serious injury or death</strong>. Trucks and buses killed one, hurt another. Motorcycles and mopeds left one with a serious injury. Bikes did not kill, but they did not escape harm either. The street is a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No bold moves.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it here. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders have not made Bath Beach a priority.</strong> There are no new protected bike lanes. No major intersection redesigns. The silence is loud. Each day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crossings can be protected. But only if leaders act. Only if neighbors demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings.

Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.'

The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles.

The court found the city may have acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally" by ordering the removal without proper legal notice. City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children. The city claimed it would only shift the lane, not remove it, but advocates countered that any removal increases danger.

The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.'

Lander promised more protected bike lanes, a citywide Bus Rapid Transit network, and using congestion pricing revenue for busways and bikeways. He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users. Their safety analyst noted: 'A comprehensive plan for safer streets and better public transit typically prioritizes vulnerable road users, supports mode shift, and aligns with best practices for population-level safety improvements.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The threat of cars remains.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 11, 2025, that parents at Public School 110 in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, are calling for a Paris-style school street to protect children. Their plan would turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, and close a slip lane to block cut-through traffic from the BQE. The push follows a fatal crash at Monitor and Driggs, where a driver killed 73-year-old cyclist Teddy Orzechowski. Streetsblog notes, 'Streets outside schools have higher crash and injury rates than the city average.' Most PS 110 families walk or bike, but the city has not responded to the proposal. The article highlights the persistent risk from drivers using local streets as shortcuts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses.

She had the signal. The driver sped through. Bones broke. She died on Rutland Road. The street stayed loud. Witnesses watched. The city’s crackdown missed the real threat.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on May 16, 2025, that a 68-year-old woman, Maurette Lafleur, was killed by a driver while crossing Rutland Road at E. 95th Street in East Flatbush. Lafleur was in the crosswalk with the walk signal when the driver of a 2025 Mercedes Benz GLC 300 struck her. A witness told Streetsblog, "The lady spin around and sped through," and described hearing the impact. The article notes that police have not released the driver's name. The incident occurred as NYPD focused enforcement on electric bikes, while drivers continue to cause deadly harm. The tragedy highlights the ongoing danger to pedestrians and raises questions about city policy and street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
