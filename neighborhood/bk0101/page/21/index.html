Former Brooklyn Democratic Party Chair Frank Seddio opposed the lane reduction, urging allies to resist the change. The meeting excluded some officials who support shrinking the highway, such as Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, who cite environmental and community health concerns.

Restler said, 'My top priority is expanding street safety.' The bill now requires a digital training course and valid ID for complainants. Only unoccupied cars can be reported.

The bill, now revised, drops the 25 percent bounty for citizen reporters. It requires digital training and valid New York identification. The rollout starts in Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn, expanding citywide over three years. The Department of Transportation must create a mobile app and post signage in reporting zones. The bill doubles reporting zones around schools to 2,640 feet. Restler said, 'The updated version of this bill will prioritize safety by reducing the likelihood of conflict between neighbors while continuing to empower citizen enforcement across nearly the entirety of New York City.' Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers led the committee. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives and Bike New York support the bill, citing the need for civilian enforcement to keep streets safe for vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT presented three proposals—The Terraces, The Lookout, and The Stoop—aiming to repair the crumbling highway and reconnect Brooklyn Heights to Brooklyn Bridge Park. Restler said, 'We need a commitment that this is the long-term solution.' Residents like Cindy McLaughlin pushed for a walkable, green city, while Amy Breedlove warned that wider highways mean more danger on local streets.

Reynoso’s stance is clear: streets must be safer for people walking and biking. He wants action after recent traffic violence and supports more open streets.
