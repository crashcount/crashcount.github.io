A pickup truck turned left and took her life. No headline. Just another number in the city’s ledger.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>Trucks, bikes, cars, mopeds.</strong> In Greenpoint, trucks killed one pedestrian. E-bikes killed one. Cars and SUVs left a trail of broken bodies—twelve moderate injuries, none fatal this year, but the threat is constant. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. The street does not care what you drive. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h3><p>The city has tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. The council could act. They have not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The numbers say otherwise. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another chance for death. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Comptroller Brad Lander stressed that 'expanded bus routes must also match 21st century travel patterns.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso linked better buses to less car dependence and climate action. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pledged 150 new miles of busways and lanes.

Council Member Steve Levin and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher have both called for action. Gallagher said, 'We must reform the way we use the roads and how we design them so that when drivers make mistakes... they don't kill people.' Despite a $40-million redesign promise from then-Mayor de Blasio, the project remains in planning.

Gallagher credited the Highway District Collision Investigation Squad and the 94th Precinct for their persistence. The Make McGuinness Safe Coalition called the street 'a highway cutting our community in two,' blaming systemic failure for repeated deaths. After Jensen's killing, then-mayor Bill de Blasio pledged $39 million for a full redesign of the boulevard. Interim safety measures, like shorter light cycles and a new crosswalk, have been installed, but the city has not released final plans.

He tried to ride the Schermerhorn Street bike lane after a snowstorm. The lane was blocked by snow and illegally parked vehicles. Restler took 41 minutes to travel half a mile and was forced to leave the lane. He declared, 'No one should have to bike into traffic because of a row of illegally parked cars.' Restler called for a comprehensive street redesign and protected bike lanes, saying, 'There’s a crisis on Schermerhorn Street.' The Department of Transportation is reportedly working on a proposal. Restler’s action highlights the failure of painted lanes to protect cyclists.
