Seven left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last twelve months, two people died just trying to cross the street. Ninety-three more were injured. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><p>Luis Cruz, 49, stepped out of his car on India Street. An e-bike delivery worker ran the stop sign and hit him. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said witness Jack Collins</a>. The rider stayed. No arrest. No justice. Collins did not mince words: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot. I&rsquo;ve seen several people get swiped.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>He knows the street</a>.</p><p>A woman, also 49, was killed in a crosswalk at Sutton and Nassau. A pickup truck turned left and took her life. No headline. Just another number in the city’s ledger.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>Trucks, bikes, cars, mopeds.</strong> In Greenpoint, trucks killed one pedestrian. E-bikes killed one. Cars and SUVs left a trail of broken bodies—twelve moderate injuries, none fatal this year, but the threat is constant. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. The street does not care what you drive. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h3><p>The city has tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. The council could act. They have not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The numbers say otherwise. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another chance for death. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Restler vows to push hard for passage, saying, 'This bill would make a tremendous difference in making our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.'

The fight for safer streets and real transit continues.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2024, the U.S. Department of Transportation rejected Mayor Adams’s request for nearly $1 billion to repair and expand the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The city sought $800 million to shore up the aging highway. The matter, described as a bid to 'maintain the structural integrity of the BQE,' faced sharp criticism. Council Member Lincoln Restler and advocates like Danny Pearlstein (Riders Alliance) opposed the plan, arguing it would worsen conditions for vulnerable road users and fail to improve transit. Jon Orcutt called it 'a bad project.' Community groups, including the Brooklyn Heights Association, withheld support. The federal decision halts expansion and buys time for a safer, more community-driven solution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, supported by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows a deadly crash that killed a 31-year-old woman. DOT crews installed crossings between Bond and Nevins, Hoyt and Bond, and Smith and Hoyt streets. The official matter summary states: 'Freshly painted crosswalks and new traffic signals will help slow down drivers and encourage more foot traffic and safe crossings.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the crossings vital for safety. Restler applauded the move but demanded further action, especially near the site of the fatal crash. He said, 'Mid-block crossings are a critical step in making this dangerous corridor safer.' The new measures do not cover all danger zones. Atlantic Avenue remains a threat for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s hand finally moves after years of blood.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced new mid-block pedestrian crossings on Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn’s so-called 'Boulevard of Death.' The crossings, between Nevins and Bond, Bond and Hoyt, and Hoyt and Smith streets, add crosswalks, traffic lights, and ramps. Restler said, 'These new mid-block crossings will create a greater sense of safety and community for Boerum Hill.' The Department of Transportation acted after Restler and others demanded change following the death of Katherine Harris, killed by a speeding driver. DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks. Leaders want more: curb extensions, redesigned crossings, and further traffic calming. Atlantic Avenue remains a battleground for the city’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred just before 1 a.m. The report states the driver was traveling at 'unsafe speed' and encountered 'pavement slippery' conditions. The narrative describes her skidding out, hitting the ground hard, and bleeding from the head. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor, with 'Pavement Slippery' also noted. The woman was not wearing a helmet, as documented in the report, but this detail appears after the driver error of unsafe speed. No other vehicles or people were involved.

Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.'

Restler has sponsored bills to curb illegal parking, speed up bike lane installations, and fight placard abuse.

Restler called CBTC 'a vital investment' but warned that 'a full shutdown of the G train in Greenpoint for six weeks would cause harm and disruption to our community.' He urged the MTA to 'act nimbly and find alternative construction approaches.' The G train is a lifeline for thousands in Greenpoint.
