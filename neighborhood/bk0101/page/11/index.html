A pickup truck turned left and took her life. No headline. Just another number in the city’s ledger.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>Trucks, bikes, cars, mopeds.</strong> In Greenpoint, trucks killed one pedestrian. E-bikes killed one. Cars and SUVs left a trail of broken bodies—twelve moderate injuries, none fatal this year, but the threat is constant. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. The street does not care what you drive. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h3><p>The city has tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. The council could act. They have not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The numbers say otherwise. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another chance for death. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Ossé stated, 'They brought this to the community board and there was an outpouring of support for this protected bike lane.' The matter was discussed with Community Boards 3 and 8, and local officials, schools, and businesses support the project. Council Member Lincoln Restler accused Mayor Adams of putting politics over public safety, saying, 'Mayor Adams has decided that he cares more about who he thinks is going to vote for him in 2025 than our lives.' The delay leaves cyclists exposed to ongoing danger, with injuries on the rise. The DOT’s call for more 'community engagement' is seen as a smokescreen for inaction.

Council Member Lincoln Restler questioned whether new bus lanes or busways would be installed to speed up shuttle buses for stranded riders. The matter, titled 'G train summer shutdown: ‘Czar’ will oversee service disruptions amid repairs, MTA says,' focused on the MTA's plan to centralize shutdown management and upgrade the G's ancient signals to modern CBTC technology. Restler pressed for action from the Department of Transportation, which failed to meet legal bus lane construction benchmarks last year, building only 5.2 of the required 30 miles. DOT did not respond.

Yet, penalties remain minimal: a small fine for a hood ornament, missing paperwork. The driver in the latest fatality faces no charges, despite video showing the pedestrian had the right of way. Restler declared, 'We need much stricter oversight of the private sanitation and construction truck companies that are operating in New York City.' He added, 'Companies like Manolos Trucking should not be allowed to do business in New York City.' The company did not respond to requests for comment. Oversight is lax.

Manhattan safe streets activist Jehiah Czebotar analyzed city data, finding that 77 percent of street-sweeping tickets go to repeat offenders, with 37 percent to drivers who got at least six tickets. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired last year, leaving a gap in enforcement.

Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent.

Streets stay risky for walkers and riders.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0179-2024 sits with the Committee on Public Safety. It was introduced on February 28, 2024, and laid over in committee on April 28, 2025. The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department tow pound capacity.' Council Members Kamillah Hanks (primary sponsor), Oswald Feliz, Robert F. Holden, Farah N. Louis, Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, Mercedes Narcisse, and Amanda Farías co-sponsored. The bill would force the NYPD to run tow pounds with enough space to tow cars at a rate that deters illegal conduct. It also requires public reports on tow pound capacity and towing in response to traffic violations. The committee has not advanced the bill. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill orders a map online. Streets are dangerous. Kids cross in chaos. The public will see the gaps. The city must face the truth in plain sight.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0447-2024, now in the Committee on Public Safety, was introduced on February 28, 2024. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to reporting on crossing guard deployment," demands the NYPD post an online map showing where crossing guards are stationed. Council Member Kamillah Hanks leads as primary sponsor, joined by Stevens, Schulman, Menin, Salaam, Brewer, Marte, and others, including a request from the Bronx Borough President. The bill is for 'informational purposes only,' but the impact is clear: families and advocates will finally see where the city leaves children exposed. The measure forces transparency. It makes the city’s priorities visible block by block.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
