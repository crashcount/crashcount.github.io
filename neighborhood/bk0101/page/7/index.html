Seven left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last twelve months, two people died just trying to cross the street. Ninety-three more were injured. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><p>Luis Cruz, 49, stepped out of his car on India Street. An e-bike delivery worker ran the stop sign and hit him. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said witness Jack Collins</a>. The rider stayed. No arrest. No justice. Collins did not mince words: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot. I&rsquo;ve seen several people get swiped.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>He knows the street</a>.</p><p>A woman, also 49, was killed in a crosswalk at Sutton and Nassau. A pickup truck turned left and took her life. No headline. Just another number in the city’s ledger.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>Trucks, bikes, cars, mopeds.</strong> In Greenpoint, trucks killed one pedestrian. E-bikes killed one. Cars and SUVs left a trail of broken bodies—twelve moderate injuries, none fatal this year, but the threat is constant. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. The street does not care what you drive. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h3><p>The city has tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. The council could act. They have not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The numbers say otherwise. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another chance for death. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council member Lincoln Restler said, 'Having an alternative use for this space during this period for the G train [shutdown] makes a ton of sense. It gives us an opportunity to see how it goes.' DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno said the closure will 'enhance safety and create new public space.' The North Brooklyn Parks Alliance set up planters to keep cars out.

Restler is organizing local businesses to pressure DOT, demanding wider bike lanes and sidewalks, curb separation to block drivers, and safer pedestrian crossings. He says, 'If we really care about cyclists and their safety in New York City, then we should design and implement bike lanes that show it.' DOT spokesperson Will Livingston says the agency is reviewing the proposal but notes the city’s priority is elsewhere. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger: narrow lanes, illegal parking, and forced detours into traffic. No formal bill number or committee stage yet.

Lawmakers let NYC lower speed limits and expand red light cameras. Some safety bills stalled. Advocates won ground but lost momentum. Streets remain dangerous. The fight for safer roads continues. Progress came, but not enough.</p><p class=mb3>In June 2024, the New York State legislative session ended with mixed results for street safety. Governor Hochul paused congestion pricing, stalling a major funding plan. Lawmakers passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits, but exempted some roads. The city can now expand red light cameras from 150 to 600 intersections. Other measures, like parking enforcement cameras on sweepers and the Idaho Stop for cyclists, passed only one chamber. Speed governors for reckless drivers and daylighting did not advance. Advocates like Eric McClure called Sammy’s Law a 'huge victory,' but noted, 'there’s so much more the legislature could be doing.' Council Member Lincoln Restler called the failure to pass sweeper camera enforcement 'super disappointing.' The congestion pricing drama overshadowed progress. Vulnerable road users gained some protections, but systemic danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, organized by Riders Alliance, followed Governor Kathy Hochul’s last-minute decision to halt the Manhattan toll plan. The protest drew bus and subway riders, who chanted for immediate action and held signs demanding clean air and reliable transit. Restler declared, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' and called for more frequent bus service, better trains, and less dependence on cars and trucks. The demonstrators warned that without congestion pricing, the MTA faces a funding crisis. This threatens repairs and improvements, especially in Black, Brown, and low-income neighborhoods, and risks worsening traffic and delays for emergency services. The protest highlights the systemic danger: when transit funding is gutted, vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows internal debate and negotiation, with some members pushing for 1,325 intersections and others preferring fewer. The final number represents a four-fold increase, covering about 4 percent of city intersections. The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement. The Department of Transportation called the Council's action a critical step.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
