A pickup truck turned left and took her life. No headline. Just another number in the city’s ledger.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>Trucks, bikes, cars, mopeds.</strong> In Greenpoint, trucks killed one pedestrian. E-bikes killed one. Cars and SUVs left a trail of broken bodies—twelve moderate injuries, none fatal this year, but the threat is constant. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. The street does not care what you drive. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h3><p>The city has tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. The council could act. They have not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The numbers say otherwise. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another chance for death. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets stay deadly. Calls for licensing miss the mark. Advocates demand protected lanes, clear intersections, and employer accountability. Restrictive rules push riders to riskier modes. Real safety comes from design, not blame.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion, published September 26, 2024, argues against e-bike licensing and for street redesign. The article, titled 'Opinion: Worried About E-Bike Safety? Make the Roads Safer First,' highlights the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians due to poor infrastructure. It supports Council Member Lincoln Restler’s bill to enforce bike and bus lane obstruction rules and backs state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal’s proposal for employer-based delivery worker licensing. The piece states: 'Such proposals are heavy-handed and will deter and discourage e-bike ridership without effectively ensuring their safe operations on the street.' The author urges protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and moving Citi Bike docks off sidewalks. The message is clear: systemic fixes, not punitive measures, protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights.

The measure, not yet passed, awaits committee review and would take effect in 2029 if the city renews its contract with Lyft. The bill summary reads: 'Citi Bike members would not pay more than the MTA's intra-city transit fare for any e-bike ride under an hour or any non-electric Citi Bike ride under two hours.' Restler, the bill's sponsor, argues, 'Bike share is an essential part of transit in NYC. It needs to be affordable & accessible for all.' He criticizes the current model, where e-bike rides can cost up to $7.20 for a half-hour, far above the $2.90 subway fare. The bill would require public investment to lower fares, following models in Boston and Washington, D.C.

He said, 'What a silly system we have that's depending on hundreds of cars and trucks going around New York City to recharge our sustainable form of transit.' Restler’s push aims to make e-bikes accessible for working-class New Yorkers and reduce car and truck trips tied to battery swaps.

According to the event summary, 'the cancellation of elevator installations at 23 subway stations' followed the funding cut. Gallagher condemned the decision, declaring, 'We all matter, and we all need elevators, and we all need congestion pricing.' Comptroller Brad Lander called the move 'shameful.'
