E-bikes killed one. Cars and SUVs left a trail of broken bodies—twelve moderate injuries, none fatal this year, but the threat is constant. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. The street does not care what you drive. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h3><p>The city has tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. The council could act. They have not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The numbers say otherwise. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another chance for death. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Its summary reads: 'Establishes in the city of New York a bicycle lane safety program to enforce certain restrictions on the use of bicycle lanes and/or protected bicycle lanes by means of bicycle lane photo devices.' Brad Hoylman-Sigal leads as primary sponsor, joined by Jabari Brisport, Kristen Gonzalez, Liz Krueger, Jessica Ramos, and Julia Salazar as co-sponsors. These lawmakers seek to use automated cameras to enforce bike lane rules, targeting drivers who endanger cyclists by blocking protected lanes. The bill does not blame victims. It focuses on driver behavior and systemic enforcement to keep vulnerable road users safe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill was first introduced in 2023, revised, and reintroduced in 2024 with the bounty restored. It has support from 17 Council members and the Brooklyn Borough President, but no hearing yet. The matter summary: 'giving New Yorkers the power to allow residents to write up drivers for parking violations like blocked bus lanes, bike lanes, and fire hydrants.' Restler’s push follows a fatal Brooklyn fire where blocked hydrants delayed rescue. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC calls for 'more pervasive enforcement and higher fines.' Advocates say NYPD enforcement is lax, with 311 complaints often ignored.
