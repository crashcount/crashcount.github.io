Seven left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last twelve months, two people died just trying to cross the street. Ninety-three more were injured. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><p>Luis Cruz, 49, stepped out of his car on India Street. An e-bike delivery worker ran the stop sign and hit him. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said witness Jack Collins</a>. The rider stayed. No arrest. No justice. Collins did not mince words: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot. I&rsquo;ve seen several people get swiped.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>He knows the street</a>.</p><p>A woman, also 49, was killed in a crosswalk at Sutton and Nassau. A pickup truck turned left and took her life. No headline. Just another number in the city’s ledger.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>Trucks, bikes, cars, mopeds.</strong> In Greenpoint, trucks killed one pedestrian. E-bikes killed one. Cars and SUVs left a trail of broken bodies—twelve moderate injuries, none fatal this year, but the threat is constant. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. The street does not care what you drive. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h3><p>The city has tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. The council could act. They have not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The numbers say otherwise. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another chance for death. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Restler blasted the reversal, pointing to weekly crashes and years of community work now ignored.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams reversed his support for the McGuinness Boulevard safety redesign, a plan developed by the Department of Transportation and approved by the community board after two years of work. The matter, described as a 'NYC transportation policy dispute: McGuinness Blvd safety redesign reversal,' saw Adams cite opposition from a business-organized town hall, despite over 7,000 residents signing a petition for the redesign. Council Member Lincoln Restler, who supported the plan, criticized Adams, stating, 'We experience a crash per week on McGuinness.' Restler called for renewed efforts to implement the safety measures, highlighting the ongoing danger to pedestrians and cyclists. The mayor’s decision, influenced by his chief adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, leaves vulnerable road users at risk and delays long-promised protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, which would grant New York City local control over its speed limits, remains stalled in the Assembly. The rally, led by Families for Safe Streets, called out lawmakers for refusing to bring the measure to a vote. Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry. The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection, once part of an Open Street program, lost its protections after local backlash. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said, "The community has tried for a bike lane on this exact street & a play street in front of the school, and all were KILLED by backlash. Blood is on our hands. Shame on us." Advocates like Noel Hidalgo and Bronwyn Breitner called out city delays and DOT inaction. The Department of Transportation made minor changes but failed to stand up to opposition.

The matter, discussed on June 2, 2023, involves no formal bill but features heated criticism in the City Council and from state officials. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the city's planning 'shortsighted' and warned of 'catastrophic' consequences if the cantilever collapses. Council Member Lincoln Restler voiced 'disappointment' over DOT's delay in automated truck weight enforcement. The Adams administration is considering a full six-lane rebuild, which Simon says would be 'just as polluting and climate insensitive.' DOT claims the BQE is safe and promises interim repairs, but work on a permanent fix may not start until 2027. Local officials expect more delays due to community opposition and litigation. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the city fails to act swiftly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
