Seven left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last twelve months, two people died just trying to cross the street. Ninety-three more were injured. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><p>Luis Cruz, 49, stepped out of his car on India Street. An e-bike delivery worker ran the stop sign and hit him. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said witness Jack Collins</a>. The rider stayed. No arrest. No justice. Collins did not mince words: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot. I&rsquo;ve seen several people get swiped.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>He knows the street</a>.</p><p>A woman, also 49, was killed in a crosswalk at Sutton and Nassau. A pickup truck turned left and took her life. No headline. Just another number in the city’s ledger.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>Trucks, bikes, cars, mopeds.</strong> In Greenpoint, trucks killed one pedestrian. E-bikes killed one. Cars and SUVs left a trail of broken bodies—twelve moderate injuries, none fatal this year, but the threat is constant. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. The street does not care what you drive. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h3><p>The city has tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. The council could act. They have not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The numbers say otherwise. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another chance for death. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) manages these paths but has failed to keep them clear. As one rider put it, 'They should maintain [it] so bikers who use it don't get whacked and don't need to ride in the middle of the lanes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler responded to complaints, tweeting that DOT would prune Kent Avenue’s bike lane 'next week.' The article, 'Too Green: City Neglects Overgrown Bike Paths,' details how weeds squeeze lanes to a single rider, forcing cyclists into traffic. Advocates urge regular maintenance and clearer agency roles, warning that neglect makes greenways unsafe for all who rely on them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as closing the 'black hat black hole,' faces resistance from some community members, but data show high demand and low car ownership. Council Member Lincoln Restler, a strong supporter, stated, 'I have been working with DOT to help expand access to Citi Bike for South Williamsburg residents.' He praised DOT’s outreach and progress. Despite the expansion, a significant part of the neighborhood will remain without Citi Bike access. Political resistance has slowed progress, but the new docks mark a step forward for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, affordable transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gutiérrez, joined by U.S. Rep.

Lander called this a repeat of past errors, saying, 'Even maintaining a state of good repair on existing roadway infrastructure would be a better use of money than widening the highway.' Gallagher warned, 'New York state risks squandering the historic investments of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act by directing far too much funding toward highway expansion instead of climate resilient, multimodal projects.'
