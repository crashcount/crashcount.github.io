Safety waits while lawsuits drag on.</p><p class=mb3>On August 8, 2025, the Department of Transportation reaffirmed its commitment to protected bike lanes and traffic calming on 31st Street in Astoria, despite a lawsuit from local businesses. The project, not tied to a council bill or committee, aims to cut injuries on a deadly corridor. DOT spokesman Will Livingston said, “We stand firmly behind this project and will defend our work in court.” Council Member Tiffany Caban, Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas backed the redesign in June. The safety analyst warns: opposition and misinformation from businesses can stall proven safety measures, putting vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The call for change grows louder.</p><p class=mb3>On August 7, 2025, Sophia Lebowitz and street safety advocates renewed demands for a Morgan Avenue redesign after a third pedestrian death in three years. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'renewing calls from advocates for the city to redesign the dangerous street.' Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, State Sen. Julia Salazar, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher back the push. Advocates want a protected bike lane, mid-block crossings, and safer loading zones. Despite meetings and official letters, the city has not acted. The safety analyst notes: advocacy alone brings no immediate safety change, but it could spark future improvements. The danger remains until the city moves.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
