Another 658 are hurt.</strong> Those figures come from city crash records for this neighborhood through Sep 4, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-keeps-breaking>Where the street keeps breaking</h3><p>Avenue D leads the list of harm, with deaths and injuries tied to that corridor (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). FDR Drive cuts its own line of loss. Avenue C and 1st Avenue follow close behind, each with repeated crashes in the record.</p><p>Evenings hit hard. Injuries peak at 8 PM and 9 PM, with 44 at each hour recorded in this dataset. Deaths strike at 7 PM, 10 PM, and 11 PM, alongside dozens more injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Named factors show up again and again: inattention and failure to yield sit in the file; speed appears in specific cases, too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). One record logs an unlicensed driver, unsafe speed, and a man killed in the crosswalk at Cooper Square in the early morning of Nov 27, 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-bodies-behind-the-numbers>The bodies behind the numbers</h3><p>Pedestrians take most of the deaths here. Cyclists pile up injuries. Trucks and buses turn into walkers at corners. Taxis and private cars do the same, over and over. This is not one bad night; it is a file that does not close (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>From 2022 through this week, serious injuries in this area reach nine, spread across modes and years. The toll does not spare the young or the old (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-slow-the-cars>Fix the corners, slow the cars</h3><p>The map points to corners like Avenue D and East 10th, Avenue C and East 10th. These need daylighting now, with no parking blocking sight lines. City lawmakers have a bill to ban parking at crosswalks; our Council Member <a href=/council-district/2/>Carlina Rivera</a> is a co-sponsor (Int 1138-2024, timeline record).</p><p>Night harm calls for night action: targeted enforcement where injuries spike after dark; hardened turns on Avenue C and Avenue D; leading pedestrian intervals where walkers move first. The data flags heavy vehicles in the mix; turning controls and truck routing can cut those impacts (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=albanys-lever-on-the-worst-repeat-drivers>Albany’s lever on the worst repeat drivers</h3><p>There is a bill to stop the most dangerous pattern drivers. Senate bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> would require speed-limiting tech for anyone who racks up 11 points in 24 months or six speed/red-light camera tickets in a year. Our State Senator <a href=/senate-district/27/>Brian Kavanagh</a> voted yes in committee (timeline record; <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Our Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/74/>Harvey Epstein</a> co-sponsors the Assembly companion A 2299 (timeline record).</p><p>Cameras work best when they stay on. The Legislature renewed NYC’s school-zone speed cameras through 2030; Senator <a href=/senate-district/27/>Kavanagh</a> voted yes in June (S 8344, timeline record; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>).</p><h3 id=slow-it-everywhere-save-lives-here>Slow it everywhere, save lives here</h3><p>Lower, enforced speeds save lives. A citywide lower default, paired with speed limiters for repeat violators, would reach the corners where people keep getting hit. That is the path from the taxi on East 5th to fewer names in the file. If you live these streets, ask City Hall and Albany to move.
