Another 658 are hurt.</strong> Those figures come from city crash records for this neighborhood through Sep 4, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-keeps-breaking>Where the street keeps breaking</h3><p>Avenue D leads the list of harm, with deaths and injuries tied to that corridor (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). FDR Drive cuts its own line of loss. Avenue C and 1st Avenue follow close behind, each with repeated crashes in the record.</p><p>Evenings hit hard. Injuries peak at 8 PM and 9 PM, with 44 at each hour recorded in this dataset. Deaths strike at 7 PM, 10 PM, and 11 PM, alongside dozens more injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Named factors show up again and again: inattention and failure to yield sit in the file; speed appears in specific cases, too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). One record logs an unlicensed driver, unsafe speed, and a man killed in the crosswalk at Cooper Square in the early morning of Nov 27, 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-bodies-behind-the-numbers>The bodies behind the numbers</h3><p>Pedestrians take most of the deaths here. Cyclists pile up injuries. Trucks and buses turn into walkers at corners. Taxis and private cars do the same, over and over. This is not one bad night; it is a file that does not close (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>From 2022 through this week, serious injuries in this area reach nine, spread across modes and years. The toll does not spare the young or the old (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-slow-the-cars>Fix the corners, slow the cars</h3><p>The map points to corners like Avenue D and East 10th, Avenue C and East 10th. These need daylighting now, with no parking blocking sight lines. City lawmakers have a bill to ban parking at crosswalks; our Council Member <a href=/council-district/2/>Carlina Rivera</a> is a co-sponsor (Int 1138-2024, timeline record).</p><p>Night harm calls for night action: targeted enforcement where injuries spike after dark; hardened turns on Avenue C and Avenue D; leading pedestrian intervals where walkers move first. The data flags heavy vehicles in the mix; turning controls and truck routing can cut those impacts (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=albanys-lever-on-the-worst-repeat-drivers>Albany’s lever on the worst repeat drivers</h3><p>There is a bill to stop the most dangerous pattern drivers. Senate bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> would require speed-limiting tech for anyone who racks up 11 points in 24 months or six speed/red-light camera tickets in a year. Our State Senator <a href=/senate-district/27/>Brian Kavanagh</a> voted yes in committee (timeline record; <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Our Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/74/>Harvey Epstein</a> co-sponsors the Assembly companion A 2299 (timeline record).</p><p>Cameras work best when they stay on. The Legislature renewed NYC’s school-zone speed cameras through 2030; Senator <a href=/senate-district/27/>Kavanagh</a> voted yes in June (S 8344, timeline record; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>).</p><h3 id=slow-it-everywhere-save-lives-here>Slow it everywhere, save lives here</h3><p>Lower, enforced speeds save lives. A citywide lower default, paired with speed limiters for repeat violators, would reach the corners where people keep getting hit. That is the path from the taxi on East 5th to fewer names in the file. If you live these streets, ask City Hall and Albany to move.

Vulnerable road users wait for action. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On August 22, 2024, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (District 47) joined the debate over New York’s congestion pricing plan. The original $15 toll was paused by Governor Hochul in June. Now, officials consider a lower toll or alternatives to fund the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'we need congestion pricing.' The matter, titled 'MTA boss ‘thrilled’ Kathy Hochul eyeing lower congestion toll after NY gov indefinitely paused controversial scheme,' highlights the urgency of MTA financing. Assemblywoman Deborah Glick noted Hochul’s commitment to a replacement plan. The bill’s status remains in flux, with no committee or vote recorded. The safety impact for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—was not assessed. The city’s most at-risk remain exposed as leaders argue over dollars and cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill's text is blunt: 'Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady.' No formal safety analyst note was provided, but speed cameras have a record of reducing driver speed and protecting children walking to school.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No replacement for the lost $1 billion. Transit riders and street users face uncertainty. Lawmakers call the move reckless. The city waits. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
