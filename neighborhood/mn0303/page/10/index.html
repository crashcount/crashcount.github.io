Eight seriously hurt.</strong> One thousand crashes since 2022. Pedestrians, cyclists, children—none spared. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the pavement, sirens in the night, families waiting in hospital halls.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two.</strong> The rest fell to bikes, mopeds, and the endless churn of metal. In the last year alone, two more lives lost, four left with wounds that do not heal. Seventy-one injured since January. The slow grind does not stop.</p><h3 id=the-latest-blows>The Latest Blows</h3><p>On June 2, a driver made a U-turn at East 4th and Avenue D. He aimed his car at a man and hit him. The victim survived. The driver vanished into the dark. Police are still looking. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/driver-strikes-lower-east-side-pedestrian-06022025/>&ldquo;The driver made a U-turn, then rammed the vehicle into a 29-year-old man.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=promises-and-delays>Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city says it wants zero deaths. It passed Sammy’s Law. It can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not done so. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany drags its feet on renewing the law. The numbers show what delay costs: more dead, more broken.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city built new crosswalks. It added bike lanes. It talks about Vision Zero. But the dead keep coming. The law lets leaders act. They have not acted fast enough.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do><strong>What You Can Do</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The street does not care. Only action will stop the bleeding.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk.

The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction.

The plan, not yet in committee or assigned a bill number, seeks federal support through the Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods grant. Levine urges Mayor Adams to apply for funding, stating, 'We’re a perfect candidate for Reconnecting Communities.' State Senator Brian Kavanagh voiced support, saying, 'We will work with the borough president.' The proposal would transform the underused highway into a waterfront space for cyclists and pedestrians, echoing successful removals in cities like Seattle and Seoul.

The city previously considered this removal for coastal resiliency, but dropped it from the final plan. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the plan centers vulnerable road users by reclaiming space from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The city’s crosswalks remain unchanged.
