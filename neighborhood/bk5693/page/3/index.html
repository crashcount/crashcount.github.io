One serious injury. Sixty-eight hurt.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Shirley Chisholm State Park since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are lives. A 35-year-old woman killed on the Belt Parkway. A 21-year-old ejected and left unconscious. A 59-year-old with whiplash, a 38-year-old with a broken back.

Not yet.</strong> But the young are not spared. Four under 18 have been injured in the last three years. The pain is spread across every age. Most victims are drivers or passengers, but pedestrians are not safe. One was killed, struck and left with crush injuries. The road does not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They have power.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. Speed cameras can be expanded. But the pace is slow. The law is on the books, but the limit is not yet lower. Cameras work, but only if they stay on. Each day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead>The Road Ahead</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can act. The state can act. They have not done enough. The numbers do not lie. The dead do not speak. But you can.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark.

If DOT cannot meet the deadline, it must post a public notice and alert the community board. Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The measure responds to the hazard of prolonged, uneven streets, which put pedestrians, cyclists, and people with mobility devices at risk. The law’s timeline and notice rules take effect in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
