In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> and <strong>thirteen suffered serious injuries</strong> on the streets of South Ozone Park. The bodies are not numbers. A cyclist was left in critical condition after a hit-and-run on 115th Avenue. Police found him unconscious. The driver kept going. <em>&ldquo;They are now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver&rdquo;</em> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A woman, 51, killed by a taxi at Lefferts and 115th. A child, crushed but alive. A 52-year-old pedestrian struck dead by a motorcycle at Liberty and 114th. A moped driver, helmet on, ejected and killed on Nassau Expressway. The list does not end. <strong>Four deaths. Thirteen serious injuries. Over 1,700 hurt.</strong></p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-speed-and-silence>The Pattern: Cars, Speed, and Silence</h3><p>The machines do not care. <strong>Cars and SUVs led the roll call of harm</strong>: one death, five serious injuries, thirty-eight moderate injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, seriously injured two, and left another with a broken body. Trucks and buses, too, left their mark. Bikes, one moderate injury. The pattern is clear. The violence is not random.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit stands. The council waits. The mayor waits. The dead do not wait. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% where installed. Injuries drop 14%.</strong> But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. <em>&ldquo;Police report that several pedestrians were struck at the location, resulting in at least nine injuries&rdquo;</em> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-struck-several-people-injured-being-hit-south-richmond-hill/16124727/>ABC7</a>).</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood.</strong> Call your council member.

According to the police report, 'A bus turned left. A 64-year-old woman walked with the light. The bumper struck her full. Her body crushed. She stayed awake.' The crash occurred at 18:28. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor. The woman suffered crush injuries to her entire body but remained conscious at the scene. The impact point was the bus’s left front bumper. The pedestrian’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted in the report, but the driver’s failure to yield is the primary factor cited by police.
