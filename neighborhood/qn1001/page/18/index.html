In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> and <strong>thirteen suffered serious injuries</strong> on the streets of South Ozone Park. The bodies are not numbers. A cyclist was left in critical condition after a hit-and-run on 115th Avenue. Police found him unconscious. The driver kept going. <em>&ldquo;They are now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver&rdquo;</em> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A woman, 51, killed by a taxi at Lefferts and 115th. A child, crushed but alive. A 52-year-old pedestrian struck dead by a motorcycle at Liberty and 114th. A moped driver, helmet on, ejected and killed on Nassau Expressway. The list does not end. <strong>Four deaths. Thirteen serious injuries. Over 1,700 hurt.</strong></p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-speed-and-silence>The Pattern: Cars, Speed, and Silence</h3><p>The machines do not care. <strong>Cars and SUVs led the roll call of harm</strong>: one death, five serious injuries, thirty-eight moderate injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, seriously injured two, and left another with a broken body. Trucks and buses, too, left their mark. Bikes, one moderate injury. The pattern is clear.

Advocates call it a step, not a leap. The mayor and speaker skipped safety talk. Streets still wait for real protection.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2022, the City Council and Mayor Adams reached a budget agreement, allocating $53 million in operating funds for the Department of Transportation for the fiscal year starting July 1. This is a down payment on the mayor's promised $904 million for the Streets Master Plan, but falls short of the Council's $3.1 billion ask to double the plan's targets. The plan mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes, 150 miles of dedicated bus lanes, and new public plazas. The official matter summary notes, 'the agreement provided far less for street safety projects than the Council originally sought.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams announced the deal, but neither mentioned street safety in their press conference. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, did not comment. Advocates praised the funding as a significant step, but stressed the need for strong implementation to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists.

Adams emphasized the need for 'robust investments that strengthen our communities and deliver opportunities for all New Yorkers.'

The city’s future hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 4, 2022, the City Council, led by Speaker Adrienne Adams (District 28), called for a $3.1 billion investment in the city’s Streets Master Plan. The proposal, now under budget review, seeks to fund at least 500 miles of new bus lanes, 500 miles of protected bike lanes, 38 million square feet of pedestrian space, and 40 miles of car-free busways. The Council’s action responds to the mayor’s $98.5 billion budget and aims to surpass the targets set by the Department of Transportation’s NYC Streets Plan. Adams stated, “To secure an equitable recovery for our city and improve public safety, we must focus on robust investments that strengthen our communities.” The Council’s push highlights the urgent need for safe, accessible streets and addresses the city’s funding gap for critical infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, responding to Mayor Eric Adams’s $98.5 billion budget, seeks 'robust investments that strengthen our communities and deliver opportunities for all New Yorkers.' The Council wants at least 500 miles of new bus lanes, 500 miles of protected bike lanes, 40 miles of busways, and 38 million square feet of pedestrian space. Adams’s advocacy comes as the Department of Transportation admits it lacks resources to meet even current targets, and the Mayor calls for agency cuts. The proposal remains under negotiation before the July 1 budget deadline. The Council’s plan centers vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders—by demanding more space and protection from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, part of the council’s response to the mayor’s $98.5 billion preliminary budget, seeks to expand protected bike lanes to 500 miles, bus lanes to 500 miles, and add 38 million feet of pedestrian space. The council’s plan also introduces 40 miles of car-free busways, a benchmark not found in the mayor’s plan or previous legislation. Adams and other council leaders argue this funding is vital, stating, 'To secure an equitable recovery for our city and improve public safety, we must focus on robust investments.' Transit advocates back the plan, urging the mayor to support safer, more accessible streets for all New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
