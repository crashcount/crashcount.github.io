In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> and <strong>thirteen suffered serious injuries</strong> on the streets of South Ozone Park. The bodies are not numbers. A cyclist was left in critical condition after a hit-and-run on 115th Avenue. Police found him unconscious. The driver kept going. <em>&ldquo;They are now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver&rdquo;</em> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A woman, 51, killed by a taxi at Lefferts and 115th. A child, crushed but alive. A 52-year-old pedestrian struck dead by a motorcycle at Liberty and 114th. A moped driver, helmet on, ejected and killed on Nassau Expressway. The list does not end. <strong>Four deaths. Thirteen serious injuries. Over 1,700 hurt.</strong></p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-speed-and-silence>The Pattern: Cars, Speed, and Silence</h3><p>The machines do not care. <strong>Cars and SUVs led the roll call of harm</strong>: one death, five serious injuries, thirty-eight moderate injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, seriously injured two, and left another with a broken body. Trucks and buses, too, left their mark. Bikes, one moderate injury. The pattern is clear.

The law, named after Carlos Moncayo, aims to curb a surge in construction worker deaths—22 in the past year, the highest in five years. State Sen. Jessica Ramos, representing District 13, called the law 'critically needed' as thousands of migrants enter non-union construction jobs lacking basic safety protections. Ramos and other lawmakers supported the bill, but advocates and union officials warn that without strong enforcement and education for new arrivals, deaths and injuries will persist. The law passed after years of advocacy, but the minimum fine was removed, and nonprofits struggle to train the influx of new workers.

The fight now: who controls the future.</p><p class=mb3>On January 19, 2023, a new report detailed the impact of New York City’s pandemic-era open restaurants program. The program, debated in the Council and championed by Speaker Adrienne Adams, brought outdoor dining to 17 community boards previously shut out by high fees and red tape. The report states, 'Dining in all neighborhoods [should be] a permanent part of the city’s streetscape.' Brooklyn’s share of outdoor dining rose from 16% to 25%, while Manhattan’s dropped from 70% to 49%. Queens and the Bronx doubled their share. Speaker Adams opposes dining sheds in the roadway and seeks to shift oversight from DOT to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Advocates warn DCWP lacks resources and fear a return to restrictive rules. DOT supports keeping the process simple and affordable, citing equity and vibrant streets. The Council’s decision will shape who benefits—and who is left out.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people.

The city pledged safer intersections, stronger bike lanes, and more speed cameras. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams favored parking over outdoor dining. The MTA hiked fares. Riders, walkers, and cyclists faced old dangers and new promises.</p><p class=mb3>This year-in-review covers New York City’s major transportation events and policies in 2022. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (District 28) featured prominently, voicing support for parking over curbside sheds during the outdoor dining debate. The summary, published December 27, 2022, highlights pledges to fortify 100 miles of bike lanes and make 1,000 intersections safer. The MTA settled lawsuits to make 95% of subway stations ADA compliant by 2055. The city exceeded its intersection safety goal, and the state approved 24/7 speed cameras. Adams’s stance on parking signals a preference for car storage over expanded public space, a move that can limit safety gains for pedestrians and cyclists. The review underscores a year of mixed progress: new safety measures, but persistent threats for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation cut Jamaica Avenue’s busway hours from 24/7 to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, while Archer Avenue remains round-the-clock. The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It sits with the Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, who is working with Restler to streamline the complaint process. The bill’s summary: it allows residents to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or fire hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school, creating a $175 fine and a civilian complaint protocol. Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation. The NYPD and DOT oppose the bill, citing concerns about neighbor conflict. Advocates support it, highlighting NYPD’s failure to protect vulnerable road users.

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This policy move, announced on October 26, 2022, comes as the MetroCard is phased out. The program, managed by the city and championed by Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, remains limited: 'Before we expand anything for Fair Fares, we need to make sure that everyone’s aware what Fair Fares is,' Adams said. Despite $75 million in baseline funding, only about one-third of eligible residents are enrolled. Advocates like Danny Pearlstein and Lisa Daglian urge the city to raise the income cap, calling current limits 'a ridiculously tiny amount of money.' Mayor Adams has not committed to expanding eligibility, focusing instead on outreach.
