Seven with life-changing wounds.</strong> In Corona, the street is a wound that never closes. From 2022 to June 2025, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>1,266 crashes</a> tore through this neighborhood. <strong>612 people were hurt.</strong></p><p>A 49-year-old man, walking where there was no crosswalk, was crushed by a sedan and an SUV on Grand Central Parkway. A 36-year-old moped rider died on 97th Street, his body thrown, his helmet useless. A 43-year-old woman died in the back seat of an SUV, distraction listed as the cause. An 8-year-old girl, crossing outside the lines, was left with deep cuts to her legs. These are not numbers. These are lives, stopped cold.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Children and working-age adults take the hits.</strong> In the last year, 23 kids under 18 were injured. One was seriously hurt. For adults 25 to 44, the toll is higher: 81 injured, one dead, one left with wounds that will not heal. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, SUVs and cars killed once, left three with grave injuries, and hurt 23 more. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the count, but the weight of steel and speed does the worst.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city says it wants zero deaths.</strong> Laws have passed. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The city can set speed limits lower, but in Corona, the pace of change is slow. The street stays the same. The bodies keep coming. There is no record here of local leaders standing in the street, demanding more. No sign of a council vote to claim the power Sammy’s Law gives. No public push for more cameras, more safe crossings, more space for people.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

Prosecutors said Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and driving 83 mph in a 25 mph zone when he ran a red light and struck Diaz’s BMW. Surveillance footage showed the Mercedes 'barreled through an East Elmhurst intersection' at 4:15 a.m. Diaz, headed to work at LaGuardia, died at the scene. Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail. The article highlights family grief and outrage at bail laws, quoting Diaz’s brother: 'Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail...

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment.

Brad Hoylman-Sigal leads as primary sponsor, joined by Jabari Brisport, Kristen Gonzalez, Liz Krueger, Jessica Ramos, and Julia Salazar as co-sponsors.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On December 3, 2024, a mayoral candidate forum on NYC bus service and transportation policy spotlighted City Hall’s failures. The event, organized by Riders Alliance, saw candidates attack Mayor Eric Adams for not meeting the Streets Master Plan law, which mandates 30 new miles of bus lanes each year. Adams’ administration installed only 15.7 miles last fiscal year. State Sen. Jessica Ramos said, 'The current mayor promised 150 miles of bus lanes and hasn't delivered.' Comptroller Brad Lander promised a 'professional, world-class DOT commissioner.' Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani vowed to resist business interests blocking bus projects. Sen. Zellnor Myrie, mentioned at the forum, made pro-transit promises. The forum exposed how political inaction and broken promises keep streets unsafe for bus riders and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stayed dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On December 3, 2024, six candidates for New York City mayor—Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, and Jim Walden—spoke at a Riders Alliance forum. The event focused on transit policy. Candidates pledged support for bus lanes, free buses, expanded Fair Fares, and shifting gas tax funds to mass transit. Lander vowed to end subway and street homelessness for the severely mentally ill by connecting them to stable housing. Mamdani promised a world-class bus network. Myrie pushed for citywide bus lanes. Ramos called for automatic Fair Fares registration. Stringer backed more bus routes. Walden opposed fare evasion crackdowns, urging resources go to service instead. All criticized Mayor Adams’ record on bus lanes and congestion pricing. The forum highlighted a united front for safer, more accessible transit, but offered no immediate relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
