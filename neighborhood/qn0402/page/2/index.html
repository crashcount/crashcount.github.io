Seven with life-changing wounds.</strong> In Corona, the street is a wound that never closes. From 2022 to June 2025, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>1,266 crashes</a> tore through this neighborhood. <strong>612 people were hurt.</strong></p><p>A 49-year-old man, walking where there was no crosswalk, was crushed by a sedan and an SUV on Grand Central Parkway. A 36-year-old moped rider died on 97th Street, his body thrown, his helmet useless. A 43-year-old woman died in the back seat of an SUV, distraction listed as the cause. An 8-year-old girl, crossing outside the lines, was left with deep cuts to her legs. These are not numbers. These are lives, stopped cold.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Children and working-age adults take the hits.</strong> In the last year, 23 kids under 18 were injured. One was seriously hurt. For adults 25 to 44, the toll is higher: 81 injured, one dead, one left with wounds that will not heal. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, SUVs and cars killed once, left three with grave injuries, and hurt 23 more. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the count, but the weight of steel and speed does the worst.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city says it wants zero deaths.</strong> Laws have passed. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The city can set speed limits lower, but in Corona, the pace of change is slow. The street stays the same. The bodies keep coming. There is no record here of local leaders standing in the street, demanding more. No sign of a council vote to claim the power Sammy’s Law gives. No public push for more cameras, more safe crossings, more space for people.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Every injury is a failure to act. The city has the tools. The leaders have the power. The people have the right to demand more.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets where children can cross and live.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
