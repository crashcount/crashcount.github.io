As CBS New York <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>reported</a>, &ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout.&rdquo; The shield is gone. The street is bare again.</p><p>Mayor Adams called it a matter of safety. He said he was <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/protected-bike-lane-in-williamsburg-will-be-removed-mayor-says/>&ldquo;back-pedaling on a protected bike lane&mldr; citing safety concerns.&rdquo;</a> The city’s answer to danger is to take away the only barrier between flesh and steel.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The city counts the dead. It counts the injured. It does not count the cost to families, to children, to the ones who walk and ride because they have no other way. <strong>Cars and trucks caused the most pain</strong>—22 crashes left pedestrians bleeding or worse. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the numbers are smaller. The city’s answer is to wait, to study, to undo what little was done.</p><h3 id=what-now-take-the-fight-to-city-hall>What Now? Take the Fight to City Hall</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to stop removing protections. Tell them to build streets that do not kill. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not paint. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The statement, titled 'Congestion Pricing Benefits Are Inarguable; Its Minor Problems are Easily Fixable,' urged city, state, and federal leaders to advance the Central Business District Tolling Program. Wright said, 'Congestion pricing will have benefits for communities across the city and region: It will reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. It will raise vital revenue for public transit. It will make the transportation system more equitable.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler planned a rally in support. The statement acknowledged minor impacts, like increased traffic on select highways, but insisted these can be addressed by electrifying fleets and capping highways. The focus remained on the program’s broad benefits for vulnerable road users and city residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sits stalled in the Assembly committee since January. The measure, sponsored by Senator Julia Salazar, would require NYSERDA to cover half the cost of e-bike purchases, up to $1,100. Salazar said, 'When the federal government falls short, it really does fall on the state to step up and take responsibility.' Assembly sponsor Robert Carroll added, 'This is not a luxury item.' The bill’s summary states it aims to make e-bikes accessible and reduce car dependence. If enacted, New York would join a handful of states offering direct e-bike subsidies, targeting emissions and car use in daily trips.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the Assembly as of August 30, 2022. The measure, led by State Senator Julia Salazar and Assembly Member Robert Carroll, aims to make e-bikes accessible to working-class New Yorkers. Salazar says, 'With the Ride Clean rebate, [e-bikes] really would be much more accessible to working New Yorkers.' Carroll pushes back on critics who call e-bikes a luxury, stating, 'They don’t realize that this is not a luxury item.' The program would use NYSERDA funds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, mirroring the Drive Clean program for electric cars. Advocates cite European and U.S. models.

The matter title reads, 'He was only 30: Family and friends gather to mourn Danny Vidal, deliverista killed in Bushwick.' Nurse called the city’s inaction 'a failure of our city government to protect these lives.' Councilmember Jennifer Gutierrez stressed that Bushwick’s industrial character does not excuse neglect. Attendees, including Los Deliveristas Unidos and the Workers Justice Project, demanded protected bike lanes, traffic lights, and barriers. The unprotected, painted lanes failed to shield Vidal.

NYPD agents hesitated, citing placard privilege and jurisdiction. Only after pressure did they issue a ticket. Council Member Restler now pushes a bill for citizen enforcement.</p><p class=mb3>Council Member Lincoln Restler has revived a bill that would let the public directly ticket cars for parking violations. The Department of Transportation opposes this measure. The incident, reported August 5, 2022, highlights weak NYPD enforcement against placard abuse and illegal plate covers. The matter centers on a car parked in a federal zone with obscured plates, a violation of state law. NYPD agents hesitated to act, citing placard status and unclear jurisdiction, but issued a $65 ticket after supervisor intervention. The bill, now in committee, aims to break the cycle of impunity for placard holders. Restler has also called for the elimination of placards entirely, stating, 'there are way too many scofflaw federal officers out there driving way too much to get from their (likely) suburban homes to their free, placard-guaranteed parking space in Lower Manhattan.' The affair exposes systemic failures in protecting pedestrians and cyclists from the dangers of unchecked car privilege.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Dumbo locals say they’re suffocating under constant push for tourism,' drew sharp criticism from residents over congestion, parking loss, and lack of input. Restler, however, reaffirmed his support for open streets and praised the Dumbo BID as a 'strong partner.' Resident voices split: some decried the impact on daily life and business, while others said the closure made walking safer and slowed traffic.
