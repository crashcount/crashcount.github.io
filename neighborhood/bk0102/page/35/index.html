As CBS New York <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>reported</a>, &ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout.&rdquo; The shield is gone. The street is bare again.</p><p>Mayor Adams called it a matter of safety. He said he was <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/protected-bike-lane-in-williamsburg-will-be-removed-mayor-says/>&ldquo;back-pedaling on a protected bike lane&mldr; citing safety concerns.&rdquo;</a> The city’s answer to danger is to take away the only barrier between flesh and steel.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The city counts the dead. It counts the injured. It does not count the cost to families, to children, to the ones who walk and ride because they have no other way. <strong>Cars and trucks caused the most pain</strong>—22 crashes left pedestrians bleeding or worse. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the numbers are smaller. The city’s answer is to wait, to study, to undo what little was done.</p><h3 id=what-now-take-the-fight-to-city-hall>What Now? Take the Fight to City Hall</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to stop removing protections. Tell them to build streets that do not kill. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not paint. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary states: 'This bill would prohibit commercial establishments from parking vehicles on city streets as part of their business.' Civil penalties ranged from $250 to $400 per day, with possible impoundment. Sponsors included Kalman Yeger (primary), Carlina Rivera, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kevin C. Riley, Marjorie Velázquez, Erik D.

The plan adds a two-way protected bike lane, shifts traffic to one-way, and promises real pedestrian upgrades. Advocates demand strong barriers to keep cars out. Cyclists and walkers have waited too long.</p><p class=mb3>On May 17, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) unveiled a redesign plan for Schermerhorn Street, a notorious crash corridor in Downtown Brooklyn. The plan, presented to the community board, proposes making Schermerhorn one-way between Smith Street and Third Avenue, installing a two-way protected bike lane, and moving the existing painted lane to the south side. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone called it a 'holistic approach to address traffic and bicycle safety.' Council Member Lincoln Restler said, 'Getting this has been a top priority across the district.' Former Council Member Stephen Levin and advocates have long pushed for these changes, especially to stop NYPD from blocking bike lanes. Advocates like Brian Howald and Jon Orcutt stress the need for robust, physical protection—not just paint or flexible posts—to keep drivers out. Since 2015, 555 crashes have injured 124 people and killed one pedestrian on this stretch. The plan aims to end the lawless status quo and protect the most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The roadmap calls for new bike lanes, cleaner buses, and slashed emissions. It aims to cut car pollution, expand green space, and shield neighborhoods from floods. The plan is non-binding but bold.</p><p class=mb3>On May 10, 2022, Councilmember Lincoln Restler of District 33 announced a sweeping climate action roadmap—the first district-level plan in New York City. The proposal, which is non-binding, was not assigned to a council committee but sets a template for local advocacy and funding. The plan’s summary states it will 'address local climate crises by reducing building and vehicular emissions, expanding green space and infrastructure, building storm surge protection, and achieving zero waste.' Restler, the sole sponsor, called for urgent neighborhood action, saying, 'We need to roll up our sleeves and take action at the local level, at the neighborhood level on our blocks.' The plan proposes new bike lanes, electrified school buses, and more renewable energy. Environmental advocates back the approach for its focus on neighborhood needs. While not law, the plan signals a push for safer, greener streets and less car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s matter title reads: "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting dynamic pricing under the city’s bike share program." Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Francisco P. Moya, Shaun Abreu, Lincoln Restler, Kalman Yeger, and Althea V. Stevens backed the measure. The bill prohibited the Department of Transportation from allowing any increase in bike share fees based on demand. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. The move targeted fare hikes that could price out riders, but the bill’s session-ending status left the issue unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Stevens led as primary sponsor, joined by 26 co-sponsors including Hudson, Williams, Restler, Krishnan, and others.

This measure aimed to expose police vehicle violence by demanding full transparency in use-of-force reporting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
