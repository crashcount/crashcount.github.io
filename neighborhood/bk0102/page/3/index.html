Councilmember Lincoln Restler tried to block challenger Sabrina Gates from the ballot. Residents cite child injuries. Advocates say injuries dropped 25% since the lane opened.</p><p class=mb3>In Council District 33, a legal dispute erupted ahead of the June 2025 Democratic primary. Councilmember Lincoln Restler, a strong backer of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, challenged the ballot access of opponent Sabrina Gates, claiming her campaign misled petition signers. A judge ruled Gates had enough valid signatures. The bike lane, built by the Department of Transportation in September, faces fierce opposition from Hasidic residents worried about child safety. At least two children have been injured by cyclists, fueling calls to reroute the lane. Over 3,200 residents signed a petition against it. Cycling advocates and Restler point to a 25% drop in injuries since the lane’s installation. Gates argues more must be done to address community complaints. The court battle centered on ballot signatures, not the lane itself, but the fight underscores deep tensions over street safety and representation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Parks Department cited a backlog of 42,000 requests and long wait times. Each of the 59 community boards will now get tree services once every nine years. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the policy, asking, "What am I supposed to do, to look my constituents...in the eye and tell them...the Parks Department isn't gonna come by to plant a tree for nine years?" Adam Ganser of New Yorkers for Parks blamed budget cuts and underfunding. Brad Vogel, a Brooklyn resident, called the grassroots request system "critical." The city’s nearly 900,000 trees fight pollution and heatwaves.

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, supported by Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez and Transportation Alternatives, bans cars on a short stretch between Flushing and Johnson Avenues and removes parking at several corners for better visibility—a process known as daylighting. DOT will also narrow Scott Avenue further south and build a concrete pedestrian peninsula at Troutman Street, banning right turns onto Scott. The intersection, described as a 'crash hotspot' with 39 incidents since 2020, will see expanded pedestrian space and improved safety. Gutierrez noted increased foot traffic and little negative feedback. DOT claims the redesign can reduce deaths and serious injuries by up to 45 percent for pedestrians.

Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection.

Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year.

They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.
