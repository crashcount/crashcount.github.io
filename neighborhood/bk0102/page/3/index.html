Ten left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, 242 people have been hurt in crashes. Two of the dead were in their forties and fifties. One was a man on a bike, crushed and left unconscious on Kent Avenue. Another was a driver, gone before dawn on Lorimer Street. A 26-year-old woman, walking where she should have been safe, was struck and left bleeding on Hope Street. A pair of teenagers, riding a bike together, were thrown and cut open on Driggs Avenue. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives, broken and ended. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, and trucks together caused the bulk of pedestrian injuries. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the steel and speed of cars leave the deepest wounds. In one crash, a truck flipped on the BQE, downed a pole, and set off a chain of collisions. &ldquo;A truck had downed a pole, triggering another crash on the opposite side of the expressway,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/05/one-person-injured-after-truck-flips-on-brooklyn-queens-expressway/>reported the NY Daily News</a>. One person was taken to Woodhull Hospital. The road was left scattered with debris and fear.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit in Williamsburg is still higher. Speed cameras, proven to cut speeding and injuries, are at risk if Albany does not act again. The city has redesigned intersections and added some protected bike lanes, but the pace is slow. The carnage is not. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> It is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more safe crossings, more protected lanes. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Two SUVs, both traveling north, collided when the rear vehicle struck the center back end of the front vehicle. The driver of the rear SUV, a 45-year-old man, was injured with neck pain and whiplash but was conscious and wearing a lap belt. The report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor to the collision. Both drivers were licensed and operating their vehicles going straight ahead. The impact point and vehicle damage confirm a rear-end collision caused by the rear driver's failure to maintain attention.

A sedan driven by a licensed female driver was entering a parked position when it struck a northbound bicyclist. The bicyclist, a 22-year-old male, sustained injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot, resulting in shock. The point of impact was the sedan's left front quarter panel and the bike's center front end. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Keep Right' as contributing factors attributed to the bicyclist, but the primary driver error was the sedan driver's inattention while maneuvering. The bicyclist was not ejected and wore no safety equipment. No visible complaints were noted from the cyclist at the scene. This collision highlights the dangers posed by distracted drivers entering parking spaces amid active bicycle traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
