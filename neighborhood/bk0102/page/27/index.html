Since 2022, three people have died and 860 have been injured in crashes. Thirteen of those injuries were serious. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. Forty-nine children have been hurt. Some never made it to school. Some never made it home.</p><p>Last month, a cyclist was left with a bleeding head after a car struck him on Kent Avenue. Days before, two teenagers on bikes were cut down by a sedan on Driggs Avenue. The crash report lists the cause: &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction. Unsafe Speed.&rdquo; No one writes what the parents saw. No one lists the sound the bike made when it hit the ground.</p><h3 id=the-voices-that-remain>The Voices That Remain</h3><p>The pain does not fade. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>. The words are plain. The loss is not.</p><p>A relative tried to explain the unexplainable: &ldquo;It was just a freak accident. Nothing intentional. I know that he loved her. He loved her dearly. He&rsquo;d do anything for her, and she would do the same for him.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>The quote stands alone</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The numbers climb. Local leaders have not stood still. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>sponsored bills to curb repeat speeding and mandate speed limiters</a> for the worst offenders. She has voted to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/13/can-new-york-city-fix-its-deadly-conduit-to-jfk-airport>extend school speed zones</a> and spoken out for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>safer street redesigns</a>. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>co-sponsored bills for speed limiters and automated bike lane enforcement</a>. These are steps, not finish lines.</p><p>But the street is still hungry. Most injuries come from cars and SUVs. Speed and distraction are not rare. They are the rule. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it everywhere it can. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation cited federal and state rules for the widening. The plan, discussed in a public meeting, drew sharp criticism. The matter summary reads: 'proposing three similar options for a redesign that will restore three lanes of traffic in each direction, with a park on top.' Liz Denys of Bridges 4 People called out the city for ignoring creative ideas and failing to reduce car and truck traffic. William Meehan criticized the focus on beautification over safety. Council Member Lincoln Restler urged a reduction in car impacts, while Borough President Antonio Reynoso condemned the neglect of environmental justice. Advocates say the plan keeps vulnerable road users in danger and misses a chance to make streets safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Reynoso insists the new corridor must be at least as long as Manhattan’s six-and-a-half-mile stretch, not just a patchwork of short Open Streets. He told Streetsblog, "We have to think about, long-term, having a route that is as long if not longer than the one Manhattan does." Reynoso commits city funding to make this happen. The Adams administration has yet to announce plans. The matter, described as 'expansion of car-free Summer Streets program to Brooklyn,' remains in policy advocacy, with support from public-space advocates. Reynoso’s push centers on opening streets to pedestrians and cyclists, not just for events, but as a lasting, borough-wide change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
