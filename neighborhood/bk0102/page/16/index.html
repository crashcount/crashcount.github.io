A cyclist, helmet on, is crushed on Kent Avenue. Two teens on bikes, both sixteen, are thrown and cut open on Driggs. A pedestrian, 26, is struck in the head by a backing sedan on Hope Street. In three and a half years, <strong>Williamsburg has seen 3 deaths and 10 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>825 people have been hurt</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not heal.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-bones>Broken Promises, Broken Bones</h3><p>The city tried to build a shield. They called it a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. It was supposed to keep riders safe. It failed. Crashes piled up. The city tore it out. As CBS New York <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>reported</a>, &ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout.&rdquo; The shield is gone. The street is bare again.</p><p>Mayor Adams called it a matter of safety. He said he was <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/protected-bike-lane-in-williamsburg-will-be-removed-mayor-says/>&ldquo;back-pedaling on a protected bike lane&mldr; citing safety concerns.&rdquo;</a> The city’s answer to danger is to take away the only barrier between flesh and steel.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The city counts the dead. It counts the injured. It does not count the cost to families, to children, to the ones who walk and ride because they have no other way. <strong>Cars and trucks caused the most pain</strong>—22 crashes left pedestrians bleeding or worse. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the numbers are smaller. The city’s answer is to wait, to study, to undo what little was done.</p><h3 id=what-now-take-the-fight-to-city-hall>What Now? Take the Fight to City Hall</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to stop removing protections. Tell them to build streets that do not kill. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not paint. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Trucks flood neighborhoods, endanger lives, and choke streets. Introduction 708 demands safer, smarter routes. The bill has strong support. The city’s map has not changed since the 1970s.</p><p class=mb3>Introduction 708, sponsored by Council Member Alexa Avilés, seeks a sweeping overhaul of New York City’s outdated truck route map. The bill, now before the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was highlighted in an op-ed published November 13, 2023. Avilés, as committee chair, wrote, 'An overhaul of our truck route map is long overdue. We must pass Introduction 708 for the sake of our communities and all New Yorkers.' The measure would require the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to improve safety, visibility, and reduce congestion and emissions. It also mandates input from neighborhoods, environmental groups, and industry. Avilés leads a coalition of 40 co-sponsors, with support from Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. The bill responds to the surge in freight traffic, which has battered streets and put vulnerable communities—often communities of color—at risk. The current map, unchanged since the 1970s, routes heavy trucks through residential areas, increasing danger for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No new public money. Electrification pilot starts. Advocates slam lack of expansion. Riders outside core zones stay shut out. System grows in power, not reach.</p><p class=mb3>On November 6, 2023, the Adams Administration and Lyft announced amendments to the Citi Bike contract, which runs through 2029. The deal, covered in Streetsblog NYC, doubles e-bikes from 10,000 to 20,000 and adds new and replacement classic bikes. The matter summary states, 'No system expansion... you're not going to be able to ride the bikes anywhere new because system expansion was not part of the amendment agreement.' Council members were not directly named, but Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso praised electrification, saying, 'This is exactly the direction we should be moving in—toward greener, safer, and more accessible micromobility options for New Yorkers.' John Tomac of Bike South Brooklyn condemned the lack of expansion: 'We're disappointed that you still can’t ride a Citi Bike in most of New York City.' The contract introduces price caps but avoids public funding. The city’s refusal to expand or subsidize Citi Bike leaves many vulnerable road users in transit deserts, with safer, greener options still out of reach.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, organized by Vision Zero opponents, was set to criticize the city's road safety program. But after a tow truck driver killed 7-year-old Kamei Hughes near Fort Greene Park, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Crystal Hudson withdrew. In their open letter, they wrote, 'Holding a forum where Vision Zero will be criticized in the neighborhood next to where a young boy’s life was lost to traffic violence sends the wrong message to the community and to our borough.' The church, led by Rev. Anthony Trufant, canceled the meeting. Local residents called for more enforcement against reckless drivers. The tragedy underscored the stakes: pedestrian deaths are down, but the toll of traffic violence remains high.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event followed his administration’s interruption of several safe street projects. When pressed by a Streetsblog reporter—'Why should New Yorkers trust you to make the city’s streets safer?'—Adams replied, 'I love New York, I love New York,' and left without a substantive answer. The matter, as reported, centers on public frustration: 'Adams had previously promised to do "whatever it takes to keep our streets safe" after the child’s death.' Council Member Crystal Hudson and Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for urgent safety improvements. A Brooklyn parent’s letter demanding action drew 1,800 signatures in days.

The crash happened near Fort Greene Park, where witnesses reported the driver was speeding, using her phone, and dragged the child before stopping. The intersection’s visibility was blocked by a legally parked car, as New York City exempts itself from state daylighting rules. Council Member Crystal Hudson visited the scene, spoke with police and residents, and acknowledged a pattern of reckless tow truck driving. Hudson said, 'This is the worst possible outcome, and, yet, we are forced to reckon with the worst possible outcome at the hands of the NYPD all too often.' Residents demanded speed bumps and crossing guards. The crash came as the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and crossing guard positions were cut. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for an end to 'senseless traffic violence.'

The bill targets drivers hiding their plates from red light and speed cameras. Reports must show where, when, and how plates go unseen. Data goes public, every quarter.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0712-2022, now enacted as Local Law 155 of 2023, passed the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the full Council on October 19, 2023. The law, sponsored by Gale A. Brewer with co-sponsors including Erik D. Bottcher, Lincoln Restler, and others, amends the city code to require the Department of Transportation to report on vehicles with license plates unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems. The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The reports must be public and sent to the Mayor and Council Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more hiding the gaps.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1164-2023, now enacted, amends the city code to require an 'investment roadmap' in every Streets Master Plan starting December 1, 2026. The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passing on October 19, 2023, and became law on November 19, 2023. The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C. Riley (primary), with Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Hanif, Brewer, Restler, and Rivera as co-sponsors, the bill demands DOT report, by neighborhood, on safety infrastructure investment, crash rates, and demographics. It shines a light on which districts get safety upgrades and which are left exposed. The roadmap aims to close the gap for underserved areas, forcing transparency and accountability for every dollar spent on street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
