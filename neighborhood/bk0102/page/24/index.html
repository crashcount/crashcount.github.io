A cyclist, helmet on, is crushed on Kent Avenue. Two teens on bikes, both sixteen, are thrown and cut open on Driggs. A pedestrian, 26, is struck in the head by a backing sedan on Hope Street. In three and a half years, <strong>Williamsburg has seen 3 deaths and 10 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>825 people have been hurt</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not heal.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-bones>Broken Promises, Broken Bones</h3><p>The city tried to build a shield. They called it a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. It was supposed to keep riders safe. It failed. Crashes piled up. The city tore it out. As CBS New York <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>reported</a>, &ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout.&rdquo; The shield is gone. The street is bare again.</p><p>Mayor Adams called it a matter of safety. He said he was <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/protected-bike-lane-in-williamsburg-will-be-removed-mayor-says/>&ldquo;back-pedaling on a protected bike lane&mldr; citing safety concerns.&rdquo;</a> The city’s answer to danger is to take away the only barrier between flesh and steel.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The city counts the dead. It counts the injured. It does not count the cost to families, to children, to the ones who walk and ride because they have no other way. <strong>Cars and trucks caused the most pain</strong>—22 crashes left pedestrians bleeding or worse. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the numbers are smaller. The city’s answer is to wait, to study, to undo what little was done.</p><h3 id=what-now-take-the-fight-to-city-hall>What Now? Take the Fight to City Hall</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to stop removing protections. Tell them to build streets that do not kill. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not paint. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the Council, 'We love Lincoln Restler's bill,' and called the old law 'unnecessarily burdensome.' The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster. Bike advocates and DOT say the change is vital to meet safety targets and reduce cyclist injuries, which drop by over 30 percent where bike lanes are built.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg) confronted NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell over widespread illegal parking by police around precincts. Restler cited a study showing 70 of 77 precincts had officers’ cars blocking sidewalks, calling NYPD enforcement 'a joke.' Chell insisted he has led 5,000 inspections and issued 39 command disciplines in four months, but Restler dismissed these efforts as inadequate. Restler used the hearing to highlight his bill allowing citizen reporting of parking infractions, bypassing the broken 311 system. He argued, 'A failure of the NYPD to enforce against this issue over many years makes our streets unsafe. So why not empower citizens to do the work that the NYPD has refused to do?' The hearing exposed deep distrust and the ongoing danger NYPD’s parking practices pose to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Oswald Feliz, Marjorie Velázquez, and Lincoln Restler, amends laws to ban selling counterfeit tags, with fines starting at $1,000 for first offenses and $2,000 for repeat violations. The measure was brought before the City Council and discussed at a City Hall press conference. The matter summary states the bill 'goes after the unscrupulous used car dealers profiting considerably off a huge black market for phony tags.' Restler, as a sponsor, joins efforts to curb the spread of ghost cars, which evade speed cameras and tolls, making streets more dangerous for everyone. Lawmakers stress that the goal is deterrence, not revenue, and call for further action from online marketplaces and federal agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
