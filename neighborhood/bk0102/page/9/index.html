As CBS New York <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>reported</a>, &ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout.&rdquo; The shield is gone. The street is bare again.</p><p>Mayor Adams called it a matter of safety. He said he was <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/protected-bike-lane-in-williamsburg-will-be-removed-mayor-says/>&ldquo;back-pedaling on a protected bike lane&mldr; citing safety concerns.&rdquo;</a> The city’s answer to danger is to take away the only barrier between flesh and steel.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The city counts the dead. It counts the injured. It does not count the cost to families, to children, to the ones who walk and ride because they have no other way. <strong>Cars and trucks caused the most pain</strong>—22 crashes left pedestrians bleeding or worse. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the numbers are smaller. The city’s answer is to wait, to study, to undo what little was done.</p><h3 id=what-now-take-the-fight-to-city-hall>What Now? Take the Fight to City Hall</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to stop removing protections. Tell them to build streets that do not kill. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not paint. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Anger filled the streets.</p><p class=mb3>On September 8, 2024, a coalition of transit advocates and elected officials, including Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, gathered in Manhattan to protest Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing. The event, described as a 'citywide subway accessibility day of action,' spotlighted the $15 billion shortfall now facing the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan. According to the event summary, 'the cancellation of elevator installations at 23 subway stations' followed the funding cut. Gallagher condemned the decision, declaring, 'We all matter, and we all need elevators, and we all need congestion pricing.' Comptroller Brad Lander called the move 'shameful.' The rally demanded immediate reinstatement of congestion pricing to restore funding for subway accessibility, directly impacting disabled New Yorkers, parents, and seniors. The protest underscored the systemic danger of underfunded transit and the toll on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They filed a brief. They argue the governor has no right to halt congestion pricing. The MTA Board, not Albany, holds the power. The pause sows confusion. Streets stay clogged. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On August 23, 2024, a group of New York State legislators—Assembly Members Phil Steck and Andrew Hevesi, State Senator Julia Salazar, and former Assembly Member Dick Gottfried—filed a legal brief against Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing. The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT claims improvements, but critics remain unsatisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 20, 2024, the city announced it will proceed with a controversial redesign of McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The plan, not a council bill but a Department of Transportation decision, extends parking-protected bike lanes from Calyer Street to Meeker Avenue. Councilmember Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, criticized the move, saying, 'The mayor has put forward a compromise that nobody likes.' A coalition of elected officials—including Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso—called for a more thorough redesign, arguing the current plan preserves dangerous elements. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone claimed the redesign will make the corridor safer for all users, with new bike lanes and sidewalk extensions. Despite these claims, advocates and local leaders argue the plan fails to address core dangers and puts vulnerable road users at continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT keeps two lanes each way, adds a bike lane with overnight parking. Advocates and officials slam the move. Cyclists face danger. Promised safety upgrades vanish. Traffic stays fast. Lives remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On August 20, 2024, Mayor Adams announced a revised redesign for McGuinness Boulevard. The Department of Transportation (DOT) will install a bike lane on the southern stretch but keep two traffic lanes in each direction. The original plan called for a road diet and a parking-protected bike lane. After pushback from business interests, DOT scaled back. The new plan converts the outer lane to parking overnight, a design that has led to illegal parking and safety hazards for cyclists. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the plan, saying, 'this plan fails to dramatically slow down traffic on this dangerous boulevard.' The advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe accused the mayor of breaking his promise to prioritize safety. The compromise removes some parking, which local businesses oppose. Despite DOT claims, the redesign does not slow traffic or protect vulnerable road users as promised. The decision follows years of advocacy after a fatal crash in 2021.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in the Transportation Committee, keeps two vehicle lanes during peak hours and adds protected bike lanes along each curb. The official matter: 'City will move forward with stripped-back redesign of McGuinness Boulevard.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, joined by eight other elected officials, condemned the move, stating, 'Mayor Adams is going forward with a plan that fails Greenpoint by preserving the most dangerous elements of this roadway.' Local safety advocates and Restler argue the redesign ignores years of calls to address deadly conditions. The city’s plan abandons a previous proposal to remove a traffic lane, leaving the street’s core dangers in place. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, children—remain exposed on a corridor with a long record of crashes and deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
