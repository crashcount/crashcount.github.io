He said he was <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/protected-bike-lane-in-williamsburg-will-be-removed-mayor-says/>&ldquo;back-pedaling on a protected bike lane&mldr; citing safety concerns.&rdquo;</a> The city’s answer to danger is to take away the only barrier between flesh and steel.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The city counts the dead. It counts the injured. It does not count the cost to families, to children, to the ones who walk and ride because they have no other way. <strong>Cars and trucks caused the most pain</strong>—22 crashes left pedestrians bleeding or worse. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the numbers are smaller. The city’s answer is to wait, to study, to undo what little was done.</p><h3 id=what-now-take-the-fight-to-city-hall>What Now? Take the Fight to City Hall</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to stop removing protections. Tell them to build streets that do not kill. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not paint.

Enforcement remains weak. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 80, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn), aims to let New Yorkers report drivers who block fire hydrants, bus lanes, and bike lanes, earning a small bounty. The bill was first introduced in 2023, revised, and reintroduced in 2024 with the bounty restored. It has support from 17 Council members and the Brooklyn Borough President, but no hearing yet. The matter summary: 'giving New Yorkers the power to allow residents to write up drivers for parking violations like blocked bus lanes, bike lanes, and fire hydrants.' Restler’s push follows a fatal Brooklyn fire where blocked hydrants delayed rescue. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC calls for 'more pervasive enforcement and higher fines.' Advocates say NYPD enforcement is lax, with 311 complaints often ignored. Hydrant-blocking remains routine, putting vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary: 'New Yorkers can't afford for Citi Bike to hike prices every few months. We need to tie the cost of a CitiBike ride to the cost of a subway fare to make it more accessible and affordable to choose cycling,' said Nieve Mooney, Restler's spokesperson. Restler’s action highlights the burden on low-income riders and the need for regulation. The bill’s status is pending in committee. Mayor Adams voiced support for subsidies but offered no plan.

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.'

Streetsblog NYC named names. They praised wins—like jaywalking decriminalization and parking minimum cuts. They called out failures—delayed congestion pricing, weak bus lane enforcement, and slow bike lane rollouts. Progress, setbacks, and hard truths.</p><p class=mb3>The 2024 Streetsie Awards, published December 24, 2024, by Streetsblog NYC, reviewed the year’s transportation policy. The article highlighted both progress and setbacks, stating: 'The 2024 Streetsie Awards by Streetsblog NYC review the year's best and worst in NYC transportation policy, highlighting key events, policies, and political actors.' Key actions included the City Council decriminalizing jaywalking and cutting mandatory parking minimums, though low-density areas were left out. Council Member Lincoln Restler lost his Transportation Committee seat despite pushing for citizen enforcement against illegal parking. Speaker Adrienne Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Mayor Adams were all named for missed promises or weak follow-through. Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch’s crackdown on ghost plates drew praise. The review called out Gov. Hochul for delaying congestion pricing, then reversing course. The NYPD faced criticism for ignoring placard abuse and Vision Zero, and for deadly high-speed chases. The piece underscored the need for accountability and stronger action to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
