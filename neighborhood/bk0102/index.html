A cyclist, helmet on, is crushed on Kent Avenue. Two teens on bikes, both sixteen, are thrown and cut open on Driggs. A pedestrian, 26, is struck in the head by a backing sedan on Hope Street. In three and a half years, <strong>Williamsburg has seen 3 deaths and 10 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>825 people have been hurt</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not heal.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-bones>Broken Promises, Broken Bones</h3><p>The city tried to build a shield. They called it a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. It was supposed to keep riders safe. It failed. Crashes piled up. The city tore it out. As CBS New York <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>reported</a>, &ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout.&rdquo; The shield is gone. The street is bare again.</p><p>Mayor Adams called it a matter of safety. He said he was <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/protected-bike-lane-in-williamsburg-will-be-removed-mayor-says/>&ldquo;back-pedaling on a protected bike lane&mldr; citing safety concerns.&rdquo;</a> The city’s answer to danger is to take away the only barrier between flesh and steel.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The city counts the dead. It counts the injured. It does not count the cost to families, to children, to the ones who walk and ride because they have no other way. <strong>Cars and trucks caused the most pain</strong>—22 crashes left pedestrians bleeding or worse. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the numbers are smaller. The city’s answer is to wait, to study, to undo what little was done.</p><h3 id=what-now-take-the-fight-to-city-hall>What Now? Take the Fight to City Hall</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to stop removing protections. Tell them to build streets that do not kill. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not paint. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress.

City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children.

The lane, installed in 2024, calmed a corridor once plagued by crashes and deaths. Streetsblog NYC reported: 'A protected bike lane that was installed last year to calm a notoriously dangerous Brooklyn corridor will be removed by the Adams administration, making the roadway less safe.' Council Members Lincoln Restler and Chi Ossé condemned the move, calling it reckless and political. Brad Lander and Zohran Mamdani joined in opposition. No council bill or committee review occurred; this was a unilateral mayoral action. Removing the lane eliminates a proven safety intervention, increasing risk for cyclists and pedestrians and discouraging active transportation, which undermines safety in numbers and equitable street access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city will replace it with a painted, unprotected lane. The official matter: 'Part of the parking-protected bike lane on a hazardous stretch of Bedford Avenue ... will be removed and replaced with a non-protected painted bike lane.' Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned the move, calling it 'a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.' Transportation Alternatives noted pedestrian injuries fell 10% and driver injuries 42% after the lane was installed. The safety analyst warns: 'Removing a parking-protected bike lane and replacing it with a painted lane reduces physical protection for cyclists, likely decreasing safety and discouraging cycling, especially on a hazardous stretch.' The city moves backward. Cyclists and pedestrians face more danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their plan would turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, and close a slip lane to block cut-through traffic from the BQE. The push follows a fatal crash at Monitor and Driggs, where a driver killed 73-year-old cyclist Teddy Orzechowski. Streetsblog notes, 'Streets outside schools have higher crash and injury rates than the city average.' Most PS 110 families walk or bike, but the city has not responded to the proposal.

The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, had passed the Senate Transportation Committee but stalled in the Assembly. The measure would have required drivers caught speeding six or more times in a year to install devices preventing reckless driving. The matter summary states: 'A bill that would require recidivist speeders to install a simple device to block the car from being driven recklessly will not pass this session.' Gallagher expressed frustration, warning that every delay means preventable crashes and lives lost. Safety analysts note the bill would have directly reduced risk for pedestrians and cyclists by targeting repeat dangerous drivers. Despite support from advocates and NYC DOT, the committee cited due process and enforcement concerns. The bill must be reintroduced next year. Vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated.

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
