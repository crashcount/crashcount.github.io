But the wounds run deep. In the past twelve months, ten crashes. Four people hurt. One left with injuries so serious the scars will not fade. A cyclist, age 38, struck on Broadway. Severe cuts to the face. Unconscious on the pavement. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Data does not say who helped him</a>. It does not say if he rode again.</p><p>Children are not spared. An eight-year-old, a fifteen-year-old, a sixteen-year-old—each injured in a crash on Henry Hudson Parkway. The numbers do not show the fear in their eyes. They only count the bruises, the shock, the blood.</p><p>No deaths. But pain.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting</h3><p>The city says it is making progress. Speed cameras run day and night. The law now lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Inwood Hill Park, the pace of change is slow. Crashes keep coming. The city counts the numbers. The people count the cost.</p><p>Local leaders have the power. They can lower the speed limit. They can redesign streets. They can act now. Or they can wait for the next siren.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made somewhere—by a driver, by a planner, by a lawmaker who did not act fast enough. The city has the tools. The question is whether it will use them.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand streets that protect the people who walk and ride.</p><p>Do not wait for the next crash. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced strong support, stating, 'This administration welcomes this bill, which is in line with both our vision for a greener, more connected city.' Rivera criticized the current system: 'Many of New York's 100 miles of greenways exist only on paper with no cohesive city network.' The bill would require city agencies to present a plan by July 1 next year. It also shifts responsibility from City Planning to agencies that actually build and maintain greenways.

The vote was 43 in favor, seven against. The matter summary: 'giving the state Legislature the go-ahead to pass a three-year extension and expansion of New York City's speed camera program that allows them to operate 24/7.' Council Member David Carr (District 50) voted no. Other Republicans and two Democrats also opposed. Ydanis Rodriguez, City Transportation Commissioner, said, 'Cameras will be 24/7 the whole year.' The bill now moves to the state legislature, which must act before June 2. No formal safety analyst note was provided for this action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers urged action, saying, 'We must use all the tools at our disposal.' Council Members Joan Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and David Carr opposed, calling cameras a financial burden. Eric Dinowitz defended the program: 'If you don't want a speeding ticket, don't speed.'

The matter summary states: 'Topping the list for Adams is extending mayoral control of the city’s public schools and allowing speed cameras on city streets to operate 24/7.' State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie were key figures in these talks. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez also lobbied for expanded speed camera authority. Despite Adams’s efforts, lawmakers showed little appetite for granting 'home rule'—the power for the city to control camera placement and hours. Advocates warn that restricting camera hours to weekdays, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., leaves streets deadly at night.

The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo.
