But the wounds run deep. In the past twelve months, ten crashes. Four people hurt. One left with injuries so serious the scars will not fade. A cyclist, age 38, struck on Broadway. Severe cuts to the face. Unconscious on the pavement. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Data does not say who helped him</a>. It does not say if he rode again.</p><p>Children are not spared. An eight-year-old, a fifteen-year-old, a sixteen-year-old—each injured in a crash on Henry Hudson Parkway. The numbers do not show the fear in their eyes. They only count the bruises, the shock, the blood.</p><p>No deaths. But pain.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting</h3><p>The city says it is making progress. Speed cameras run day and night. The law now lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Inwood Hill Park, the pace of change is slow. Crashes keep coming. The city counts the numbers. The people count the cost.</p><p>Local leaders have the power. They can lower the speed limit. They can redesign streets. They can act now. Or they can wait for the next siren.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made somewhere—by a driver, by a planner, by a lawmaker who did not act fast enough. The city has the tools. The question is whether it will use them.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand streets that protect the people who walk and ride.</p><p>Do not wait for the next crash. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Despite Commissioner Rodriguez’s promise of 100 safety projects, the agency denied a FOIL request, claiming costs are not tracked. Advocates and families condemned the lack of accountability.

The project, begun in September 2021 and finished last fall, added 1,285 square feet of sidewalk, a new median, and red bus-only lanes on Westchester Avenue. The DOT worked with the MTA to cut a circuitous bus detour, giving Bx12 and other riders a direct path. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'DOT’s work at Pelham Bay Park... may be only one-10th of a mile, but the impact for thousands of riders will be gigantic.' New York City Transit President Richard Davey added, 'Bus lanes don't have to be miles long to deliver a huge impact.' The changes serve 64,000 daily riders, expanding space for pedestrians and shortening bus trips. More crosswalks now connect the busy transfer point, making the area less hostile for those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation cut Jamaica Avenue’s busway hours from 24/7 to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, while Archer Avenue remains round-the-clock. The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'NYC DOT proposal for car-free Grand Army Plaza and related street safety improvements,' is not a formal council bill but has drawn council attention. Council Member Shahana Hanif (District 39) and Crystal Hudson pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to address the plaza’s 'endless traffic, poor sidewalk conditions, broken benches, and overflowing trash cans.' Hanif and Hudson demanded immediate safety upgrades after recent crashes injured pedestrians and cyclists. DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton said, 'We want to take it to the next level... more consistent and better designed public spaces.' The agency is seeking public feedback and plans to draft detailed designs within the year. The proposal aims to end the status quo of danger and disrepair, prioritizing vulnerable road users over cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
