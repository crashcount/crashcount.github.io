This initiative, required by a 2021 City Council law, aims to reduce truck traffic and organize last-mile deliveries. The matter summary states: 'The city will launch a pilot program testing neighborhood delivery microhubs across the five boroughs, aimed at reducing the surge of truck traffic.' Councilmember Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, representing District 31, emphasized the need for sustainable infrastructure to curb environmental justice impacts from truck congestion. The program will allow large trucks to unload at designated hubs, shifting the final delivery leg to vans, cargo bikes, or carts. Details on locations and management are pending. After a year, DOT will review data and consider expansion, with a final report due in 2026. Environmentalists and advocates support the move but note it does not address warehouse siting in vulnerable communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This follows the February death of Dolma Naadhun, age 7, struck by a driver with a learner’s permit. The matter, titled 'NYC to install a traffic signal at the site of Queens crash that killed 7-year-old,' drew support from State Sen. Michael Gianaris, who said, 'I am glad the city is installing a traffic signal at the site of Naadhun's tragic death, in accordance with her family’s wishes.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'No loss of life on our streets is acceptable.' The DOT has already added curb extensions and new crosswalks. Community members, including Alex Duncan, argue that one signal is not enough and demand systemic safety changes along the corridor.

Twenty-six council members signed on, but Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers did not. Brooks-Powers argued, "Stricter speed limits must also be paired with investments in physical infrastructure as well that deter drivers from going too fast." Advocates, including DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied in support. Despite the push, the Assembly left the measure out of its budget.

A girl died here. Her brother begged for change. The city listened. Officials promise more: stop signs, curb extensions, clearer crosswalks. The driver who killed her ran a stop sign. He was unlicensed.</p><p class=mb3>On March 30, 2023, the NYC Department of Transportation announced new safety measures at a Queens intersection where 7-year-old Dolma Naadhum was killed by an SUV. The agency will install a traffic light by May, following a petition from Dolma’s brother and pressure from local leaders. State Senator Michael Gianaris, representing District 12, pledged to honor the family's request, stating, 'We fix Newtown Road where this happened.' The DOT will also add all-way stop signs at a nearby crossing and has already improved crosswalks, extended curbs, and restricted parking for better visibility. The driver in the fatal crash ran a stop sign and lacked a proper license. The city’s action comes after years of complaints about dangerous driving at this intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not a council bill but a city initiative, expanded pedestrian space with 'super sidewalks'—painted sidewalk extensions between 50th and 59th streets. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pledged to bring this design citywide, stating, 'While we are excited to bring this improvement to Hells Kitchen, we look forward to expanding these efforts elsewhere.' Council member Erik Bottcher called for similar changes on 10th and 11th Avenues. Local advocate Christine Berthet called the new space 'just like having air to breathe.' The redesign removed a car lane in a neighborhood where most households lack cars. Still, the use of paint over concrete means drivers, including NYPD, sometimes park illegally on pedestrian space.

The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agenda covers several bills: Intro 415 (dangerous driving study), Intro 555 (school safety signs), Intro 679 (traffic calming near seniors), Intro 805 (pedestrian safety reporting), Intro 854 (annual daylighting), Intro 879 (bollards at sidewalks), and Intro 441 (5 mph on Open Streets). Open Plans' Sara Lind supports daylighting, civilian and automated enforcement, and home rule for speed limit reductions, stating, 'Self-enforcing streets are best.' Jackson Chabot urges street redesigns and curb reform. Both demand immediate action to protect vulnerable road users. The hearing is the first Vision Zero session under the new mayor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsored by Patricia Fahy, the bill addresses how much the state pays for federally assisted projects and for municipal projects with complete street designs. The measure saw broad support, with near-unanimous yes votes in both chambers. The bill's focus is on funding, not on direct safety improvements for pedestrians, cyclists, or other vulnerable road users.

The city aims to curb private cars and free up streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 8, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced an expansion of its carshare program, adding 80 new curbside spaces across Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. The program, now permanent after a four-year pilot, aims for 'equitable distribution in predominantly low-income Black and brown neighborhoods with limited transportation options.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We now have the proof that convenient access to carshare frees New Yorkers from the burden of car ownership—while helping to fight climate change.' The expansion follows a pilot that saw a 38.7 million mile annual drop in driving and a reduction in private car ownership among participants. Three companies—Zipcar, Getaround, and Truqit—will deploy vehicles in the new spaces. More spots are planned later this year as the city pushes for fewer private cars and safer, less congested streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan promises a road diet, separated bike lanes, and accessibility. Officials say it will change everything. Action is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2023, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced an $18-million federal grant for redesigning Delancey Street, using most of a $21-million citywide safety fund. The project, still in the design phase, will add separated bike lanes, accessibility upgrades, and a road diet—measures meant to calm traffic and protect vulnerable road users. Gillibrand referenced the 2012 death of 12-year-old Dashane Santana and said, 'We need to do much better.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a 'citywide commitment' and said it would 'completely change the feel of Delancey Street, making it safer and more welcoming.' Since 2019, 799 crashes have injured 279 people here, including 69 cyclists and 48 pedestrians. Despite past improvements, injury rates have not dropped. The new plan aims to finally break that cycle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
