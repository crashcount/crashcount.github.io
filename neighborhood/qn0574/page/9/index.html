But the blood still runs. In the last twelve months, 68 people were hurt on these streets. Three were seriously injured. No one walks away the same. The wounds linger—broken bones, broken lives. The young are not spared. One child was injured. Most victims are in their prime: 21 injuries for ages 25–34, 19 for 35–44. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>SUVs strike hardest. In the last three years, SUVs caused the only serious pedestrian injuries here. One man, 57, crossing with the signal, was left bleeding at Cooper and Cypress. The driver failed to yield. He survived. Others were not so lucky elsewhere. Motorcycles and bikes bring their own danger, but the weight of steel and speed of engines decide who walks and who does not.</p><h3 id=the-leaders-who-wait>The Leaders Who Wait</h3><p>No deaths. No headlines. No action. Local leaders have not spoken out. No new laws. No new protections. The silence is heavy. The city has the power now—Sammy’s Law lets them lower speed limits. But the limit stays high. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany stalls. The clock ticks. The street waits.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-must-be-made>The Call That Must Be Made</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every injury is a warning. Every silence from City Hall is a choice. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Councilmember Joann Ariola opposes the plan, claiming it will worsen city travel. Delays threaten $1 billion in MTA funding. Vulnerable road users wait as traffic and pollution persist. No relief in sight.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2022, Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) joined critics in a policy debate over New York City's stalled congestion pricing plan. The measure, approved by state lawmakers three years ago, would charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The MTA faces hundreds of follow-up questions from the Federal Highway Administration, delaying the required environmental assessment. Ariola argued, 'I don’t believe it will work, in fact I believe it will make the city more unmanageable to travel through.' The plan is intended to reduce traffic, lower car pollution, and fund MTA capital improvements. Delays put $1 billion in annual funding at risk, threatening upgrades like accessible subway stations and zero-emission buses. As the debate drags on, vulnerable road users remain exposed to traffic and pollution hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter, backed by Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, State Senator Julia Salazar, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, and Council Members Lincoln Restler and Jennifer Gutierrez, called for 'protective jersey barricades and measures taken at each intersection to stop cars from entering the protected bike lane.' The group condemned the current plastic delineators, noting, 'From day one, the Grand Street bike lane has failed to keep people safe.' Since 2019, 67 cyclists have been injured and 196 crashes reported. The letter urges the city to replace weak barriers, fix dangerous entrances, and finally deliver safety for vulnerable road users.

Lives at risk until real protection arrives.</p><p class=mb3>On March 3, 2022, Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) joined activists to demand the Department of Transportation install concrete barriers on the Grand Street bike lane. The push follows years of crashes—67 cyclist injuries and 196 total crashes since 2019—despite so-called 'protected' lanes. The matter, titled 'Activists and electeds ask DOT to add better barriers to Grand Street bike lane,' highlights how plastic bollards fail to stop drivers from blocking lanes, forcing cyclists into traffic. Restler, along with Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Julia Salazar, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, signed a letter urging Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriguez to act. The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected. Activists say, 'We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021.' The call is clear: real barriers, not broken promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency cited 'raised crosswalks, pedestrian-only signal timing, new lane markings and other lane redesigns' as part of its response. Council Member Bob Holden, speaking at the scene, pressed for longer crossing times, raised crosswalks, and enforcement against illegal parking and reckless driving. Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called the situation 'traffic violence,' demanding stronger city control over speed limits and cameras. The redesign is part of Mayor Adams's plan to fix 1,000 dangerous intersections. Residents and advocates highlighted the ongoing threat from large vehicles and a culture of reckless driving.

The effort is described as 'an unprecedented effort to collect detailed data on bicycle transportation across the state.' The survey asks about riding frequency, infrastructure, barriers, and connections to transit. Assembly Member Robert Carroll and State Senator Julia Salazar have backed related legislation for an e-bike rebate program. The survey’s results will be shared with governments and advocacy groups.
