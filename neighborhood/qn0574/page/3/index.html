But the blood still runs. In the last twelve months, 68 people were hurt on these streets. Three were seriously injured. No one walks away the same. The wounds linger—broken bones, broken lives. The young are not spared. One child was injured. Most victims are in their prime: 21 injuries for ages 25–34, 19 for 35–44. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>SUVs strike hardest. In the last three years, SUVs caused the only serious pedestrian injuries here. One man, 57, crossing with the signal, was left bleeding at Cooper and Cypress. The driver failed to yield. He survived. Others were not so lucky elsewhere. Motorcycles and bikes bring their own danger, but the weight of steel and speed of engines decide who walks and who does not.</p><h3 id=the-leaders-who-wait>The Leaders Who Wait</h3><p>No deaths. No headlines. No action. Local leaders have not spoken out. No new laws. No new protections. The silence is heavy. The city has the power now—Sammy’s Law lets them lower speed limits. But the limit stays high. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany stalls. The clock ticks. The street waits.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-must-be-made>The Call That Must Be Made</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every injury is a warning. Every silence from City Hall is a choice. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable road users watch from the curb.</p><p class=mb3>On January 13, 2025, Councilwoman Joann Ariola (District 32) publicly challenged the MTA’s first-week report on New York City’s congestion pricing plan. The MTA claimed, 'There is less traffic and quicker streets,' citing a 16% drop in Midtown traffic and faster bus times. Ariola dismissed the data as 'fugazi.' The plan, imposed by the state, began January 5 with a $9 toll per car. Critics, including Ariola, Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella, and Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, questioned the numbers and economic impact. Susan Lee of New Yorkers Against Congestion Taxes noted, 'January is usually the slowest month,' and warned that some areas saw more congestion as drivers dodged tolls. The council’s debate highlights deep skepticism about the plan’s real effect on city streets and the daily safety of those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians.

Now, every case number, status, and decision must be public. The move cracks open city data, exposing delays and denials that shape street danger.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0468-2024, now enacted, came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The Council passed it on October 23, 2024; it became law November 22, 2024, as Local Law 113. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the department of transportation posting information on traffic-control device and speed reducer requests on its website.” Council Member Kalman Yeger led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law orders DOT to publish every request for traffic signals and speed humps—case number, subject, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial, and timeline if approved. The public can now track what the city does, or fails to do, when streets need taming. This transparency exposes the machinery behind every crosswalk, signal, and speed bump—vital for anyone who walks, bikes, or rides in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
