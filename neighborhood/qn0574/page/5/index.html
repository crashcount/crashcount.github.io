But the blood still runs. In the last twelve months, 68 people were hurt on these streets. Three were seriously injured. No one walks away the same. The wounds linger—broken bones, broken lives. The young are not spared. One child was injured. Most victims are in their prime: 21 injuries for ages 25–34, 19 for 35–44. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>SUVs strike hardest. In the last three years, SUVs caused the only serious pedestrian injuries here. One man, 57, crossing with the signal, was left bleeding at Cooper and Cypress. The driver failed to yield. He survived. Others were not so lucky elsewhere. Motorcycles and bikes bring their own danger, but the weight of steel and speed of engines decide who walks and who does not.</p><h3 id=the-leaders-who-wait>The Leaders Who Wait</h3><p>No deaths. No headlines. No action. Local leaders have not spoken out. No new laws. No new protections. The silence is heavy. The city has the power now—Sammy’s Law lets them lower speed limits. But the limit stays high. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany stalls. The clock ticks. The street waits.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-must-be-made>The Call That Must Be Made</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every injury is a warning. Every silence from City Hall is a choice. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law requires the Department of Transportation to publish a monthly-updated, searchable map of all city bike lanes. The map must show obstructions, construction, crash patterns, shared paths, conflict points, resurfacing, parking, bike share docks, open streets, repair shops, and reporting tools. The bill’s matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to develop a map of bicycle infrastructure conditions.' Council Member Crystal Hudson sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Sanchez, Stevens, Yeger, Restler, Avilés, and others. The law brings sunlight to hidden hazards, giving vulnerable road users the facts they need to see the city’s dangers in plain sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by Council Members Tiffany Caban and Shahana Hanif, aims to 'greenlight pedestrians to freely cross streets outside the crosswalk or without obeying traffic signals.' The bill responds to claims of biased enforcement against Black and Latino New Yorkers. Council Majority Leader Joseph Borelli and Councilwoman Joann Ariola oppose the bill, warning it could endanger pedestrians. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or received a hearing. The NYPD and Mayor's office are reviewing the legislation. The debate highlights the tension between enforcement fairness and the ongoing risk to vulnerable road users.

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The work, running from Beach Channel Drive to Shore Front Parkway, added porous pavement, new bike lanes, and wider pedestrian walkways. The city says the 11,000 square feet of new surface can absorb nearly 1.3 million gallons of stormwater each year. Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes. The changes give cyclists and pedestrians an easier, safer route to the Rockaway ferry terminal and boardwalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted. Mayor Adams’ administration also pushed for affordable housing reforms. The push for Sammy’s Law is a fight to give NYC control over its streets and protect vulnerable road users from deadly speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill faces opposition from Council Members David Weprin, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan, who argue it will hurt small businesses and outer-borough residents. On May 22, 2023, Ari Kagan said, 'Congestion Pricing will hurt countless New Yorkers, small businesses, residents of so-called outer-boroughs & will create huge lines of parked cars right outside of Manhattan.' Yet, the MTA’s assessment shows only 5,200 city drivers commute by car from areas far from fast transit—just 1.2% of that population. Advocates like Felicia Park-Rogers counter, 'this policy has the potential to be utterly transformational for our city.' The plan includes exemptions for disabled and low-income drivers.
