But the blood still runs. In the last twelve months, 68 people were hurt on these streets. Three were seriously injured. No one walks away the same. The wounds linger—broken bones, broken lives. The young are not spared. One child was injured. Most victims are in their prime: 21 injuries for ages 25–34, 19 for 35–44. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>SUVs strike hardest. In the last three years, SUVs caused the only serious pedestrian injuries here. One man, 57, crossing with the signal, was left bleeding at Cooper and Cypress. The driver failed to yield. He survived. Others were not so lucky elsewhere. Motorcycles and bikes bring their own danger, but the weight of steel and speed of engines decide who walks and who does not.</p><h3 id=the-leaders-who-wait>The Leaders Who Wait</h3><p>No deaths. No headlines. No action. Local leaders have not spoken out. No new laws. No new protections. The silence is heavy. The city has the power now—Sammy’s Law lets them lower speed limits. But the limit stays high. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany stalls. The clock ticks. The street waits.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-must-be-made>The Call That Must Be Made</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every injury is a warning. Every silence from City Hall is a choice. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

An SUV was making a left turn when it collided with a bicyclist traveling westbound. The point of impact was the right side doors of the bike and the center front end of the SUV. The bicyclist, a 23-year-old male, sustained chest injuries classified as severity level 3 and was conscious after the collision.

Vulnerable users still face car danger.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1143-2023 was introduced on August 3, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill sought to amend the city code by 'increasing civil penalties for operating a bicycle, bicycle with electric assist, or electric scooter on the sidewalk.' The measure would have raised fines up to $510 for endangering others, with double penalties for repeat violations and extra penalties for physical contact. Council Member Gale A. Brewer sponsored the bill, joined by Gennaro, Lee, Brannan, Yeger, Kagan, Vernikov, and Ariola. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst assessed its impact on vulnerable road users. The bill focused on sidewalk riding, but left the core danger—cars on city streets—untouched.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pedestrians keep crossing in the dark.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1151-2023, introduced August 3, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, aimed to require the Department of Transportation to install at least 100 illuminated, solar-powered traffic control devices at crosswalks each year for five years—a total of 500. The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The city’s crosswalks remain unchanged. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law requires the Department of Transportation to publish a monthly-updated, searchable map of all city bike lanes. The map must show obstructions, construction, crash patterns, shared paths, conflict points, resurfacing, parking, bike share docks, open streets, repair shops, and reporting tools. The bill’s matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to develop a map of bicycle infrastructure conditions.' Council Member Crystal Hudson sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Sanchez, Stevens, Yeger, Restler, Avilés, and others. The law brings sunlight to hidden hazards, giving vulnerable road users the facts they need to see the city’s dangers in plain sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
