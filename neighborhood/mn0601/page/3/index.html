But the streets did not spare the flesh. In the last twelve months, 52 people were injured in crashes across Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village. One was hurt so badly the wound was called serious. Most were younger than fifty. Some were children. Some were old. None were safe. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-never-breaks>The Pattern Never Breaks</h3><p>Crashes keep coming. In just the past year, there were 87 crashes. Taxis, sedans, SUVs, bikes. The machines change, the pain does not. A 31-year-old woman, crossing with the light, was cut down by a taxi at 1st Avenue and 22nd Street. She left the intersection with deep wounds and shock. A 78-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, was struck by a bike and left with a broken arm. The old and the young, all at risk. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>recent crash records</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They pass laws like Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is not yet 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is a gamble with someone’s life. <a href=../../take_action/>Demand action now</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The crisis is not fate. It is policy. It is speed. It is the choice to wait. The numbers will not stop climbing until leaders act. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark.

Powers said, 'This package of legislation puts forward reforms to fundamentally change our approach to scaffolding while ensuring safety is still the top priority.'

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes.

The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds.
