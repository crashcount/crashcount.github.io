But the streets did not spare the flesh. In the last twelve months, 52 people were injured in crashes across Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village. One was hurt so badly the wound was called serious. Most were younger than fifty. Some were children. Some were old. None were safe. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-never-breaks>The Pattern Never Breaks</h3><p>Crashes keep coming. In just the past year, there were 87 crashes. Taxis, sedans, SUVs, bikes. The machines change, the pain does not. A 31-year-old woman, crossing with the light, was cut down by a taxi at 1st Avenue and 22nd Street. She left the intersection with deep wounds and shock. A 78-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, was struck by a bike and left with a broken arm. The old and the young, all at risk. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>recent crash records</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They pass laws like Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is not yet 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is a gamble with someone’s life. <a href=../../take_action/>Demand action now</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The crisis is not fate. It is policy. It is speed. It is the choice to wait. The numbers will not stop climbing until leaders act. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0549-2023, filed at session’s end, came from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced April 11, 2023, and pushed by Council Member Shahana K. Hanif as primary sponsor, with Jennifer Gutiérrez and over twenty others co-sponsoring. The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ ... and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' The SAFE Streets Act package also includes safe passing for cyclists and complete street design mandates. The Council’s action highlights the city’s ongoing fight against reckless driving and the urgent need for stronger protections for people on foot, on bikes, and in cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City Hall resists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 4, 2023, the City Council, led by Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, issued its budget response to the mayor’s $103-billion plan. The Council’s $2.7-billion proposal calls for a near-doubling of Fair Fares funding, $3 million for a battery swap and fire outreach program for delivery workers, and $45.1 million more for road paving. The Council also demands increased investment in street safety infrastructure, especially in communities of color facing high crash rates. Brooks-Powers said, 'New Yorkers deserve access to high-quality services and investments in infrastructure citywide.' Council Member Keith Powers called the battery swap program a 'down payment.' The Council’s push aims to restore cuts and address deadly street conditions. City Hall, citing fiscal pressures, remains cautious but open to negotiation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Powers and Levine sent a letter on November 1 but received no response. Powers said, 'The crowds are crushing and demand is overflowing.'

The plan, echoing a 2010 First Avenue project, repurposes 23 feet for cyclists and bus riders between E. 59th and E. 96th streets. Council Member Keith Powers and Borough President Mark Levine endorsed the proposal, with Levine stating, 'The redesign’s commitment to expanded protected bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes will turn this particularly dangerous stretch of the roadway into a safer, more efficient, and forward-thinking artery.' Still, Levine and advocates like Anna Melendez (Transportation Alternatives) pressed for more: wider sidewalks, hardened pedestrian islands, and real physical protection. The plan uses only paint and plastic, leaving pedestrians exposed. The proposal faces a full board vote on October 19, 2022.

A spokesperson said, 'This project will expedite commute times, improve pedestrian safety, increase spaces for bikes, and ensure that cars, buses, and bikes can share the road in harmony.' Third Avenue is a Vision Zero priority corridor, scarred by six pedestrian and one cyclist death since 2016. Hundreds of cyclists ride here daily, despite no bike lane.

The board, once resistant, now shifts toward safety for riders.</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 8 (CB8) voted 38-3 to request 'fully protected crosstown bike lanes approximately every 10 blocks between 60th and 110th streets on both sides of Central Park, and a two-way protected bikeway around Central Park.' The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition. Now, the board calls for comprehensive, protected infrastructure to shield vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
