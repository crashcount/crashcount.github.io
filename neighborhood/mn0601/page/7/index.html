But the streets did not spare the flesh. In the last twelve months, 52 people were injured in crashes across Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village. One was hurt so badly the wound was called serious. Most were younger than fifty. Some were children. Some were old. None were safe.

In just the past year, there were 87 crashes. Taxis, sedans, SUVs, bikes. The machines change, the pain does not. A 31-year-old woman, crossing with the light, was cut down by a taxi at 1st Avenue and 22nd Street. She left the intersection with deep wounds and shock. A 78-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, was struck by a bike and left with a broken arm. The old and the young, all at risk.

They say every life matters. They pass laws like Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is not yet 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is a gamble with someone’s life. <a href=../../take_action/>Demand action now</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The crisis is not fate. It is policy. It is speed. It is the choice to wait. The numbers will not stop climbing until leaders act. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution followed the death of 28-year-old cyclist Carling Mott, killed by a truck driver on E. 85th Street. The matter, described as a push to 'bring safe bike routes to the neighborhood,' saw support from councilmembers Keith Powers and Julie Menin, who called on DOT to revisit the 85th Street lane and improve safety infrastructure. Advocates and residents backed the plan, demanding action to prevent more deaths. DOT is reviewing the location for possible upgrades. The board's vote renews a fight stalled since 2016 by political opposition.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece, titled 'Basement apartments shouldn’t be death traps,' criticizes government inaction after deadly floods from Hurricane Ida and Sandy. Kavanagh, a sponsor of recent state legislation, writes: 'New York City needs to immediately move to legalize and regulate basement apartments to ensure the safety of their tens of thousands of tenants.' He condemns defunded pilot programs and failed bills, calling for a full-scale mobilization to prevent more deaths. Kavanagh’s editorial highlights the deadly consequences of neglect and urges leaders to prioritize safety for vulnerable tenants living in basement units.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to amend the city’s administrative code to increase penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles, including those under and over 10,000 pounds, and for unauthorized horns and claxons. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing certain penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles.' Council Member Sandra Ung sponsored the bill, joined by 26 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. There is no evidence the bill would have improved safety for vulnerable road users. The city’s noise problem, and its threat to livable streets, remains unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s matter title reads: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle.” Council Member Althea V. Stevens led as primary sponsor, joined by 26 co-sponsors including Hudson, Williams, Restler, Krishnan, and others.

This measure aimed to expose police vehicle violence by demanding full transparency in use-of-force reporting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Key dates: Announced 2020, stalled as of April 8, 2022. The project, described as a 'car-free busway between 57th and 34th streets,' aimed to speed up commutes for 110,000 bus riders. Council Member Keith Powers pressed DOT for updates, saying, 'we shouldn’t miss a big opportunity to transform Fifth Avenue.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance called it 'one of the most important busways in the City.' Despite proven success elsewhere, business interests stalled progress. The current plan offers a protected bike lane and pedestrian improvements, but no dedicated bus lane. DOT has not provided a timeline. Advocates and local officials remain frustrated. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, cyclists, pedestrians—are left exposed as the city delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
