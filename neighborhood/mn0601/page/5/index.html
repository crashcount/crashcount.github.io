But the streets did not spare the flesh. In the last twelve months, 52 people were injured in crashes across Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village. One was hurt so badly the wound was called serious. Most were younger than fifty. Some were children. Some were old. None were safe.

In just the past year, there were 87 crashes. Taxis, sedans, SUVs, bikes. The machines change, the pain does not. A 31-year-old woman, crossing with the light, was cut down by a taxi at 1st Avenue and 22nd Street. She left the intersection with deep wounds and shock. A 78-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, was struck by a bike and left with a broken arm. The old and the young, all at risk. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>recent crash records</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They pass laws like Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is not yet 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is a gamble with someone’s life. <a href=../../take_action/>Demand action now</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The crisis is not fate. It is policy. It is speed. It is the choice to wait. The numbers will not stop climbing until leaders act. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On November 8, 2023, the transportation committee of Manhattan’s Community Board 6 voted 8-1 to oppose the measure, calling it 'harmful and unnecessarily punitive.' The matter’s summary: 'require license and registration for all types of e-bikes.' Council Members Keith Powers and Julie Menin support the bill; Carlina Rivera has not signed on. The committee’s resolution states the proposal would negatively impact all cyclists, especially delivery workers, and fails to address illegal mopeds or require point-of-sale registration. Critics argue the bill is regressive, ineffective, and would not improve safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT vows to return with a safety plan.</p><p class=mb3>On September 14, 2023, the Department of Transportation held a public street safety workshop in Astoria, Queens, following a surge in traffic violence. The event, covered on September 18, 2023, drew over 200 residents and was organized by Western Queens elected officials. The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal. No formal bill number or committee was cited; the event focused on immediate community engagement and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) will start enforcing the ban on uncertified lithium-ion battery sales.

DCWP spokesperson Michael Lanza said, 'While inspecting retailers for compliance with LL39, we will also check for illegal motorized scooters [mopeds], issue summonses and refer issues to NYPD and FDNY as appropriate.' Two days earlier, the City Council passed Council Member Keith Powers's bill for a citywide battery buyback program, letting delivery workers swap faulty batteries for certified ones. Powers acknowledged the ongoing problem of illegal mopeds, stating, 'We recognize that problem. We've been talking to the deputy mayor's office about further measures ahead.'

The main bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, creates a city-funded buy-back program for delivery workers to exchange faulty batteries and devices for safe, certified ones. The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation's new plan, described as a 'compromised version,' adds protected bike lanes but keeps two car lanes during peak hours from Calyer Street to the Pulaski Bridge. The matter, titled 'Relief in Greenpoint as compromise reached on McGuinness Boulevard redesign,' reflects years of advocacy for safer streets. Restler, along with Borough President Reynoso and others, welcomed the changes and pledged to push for swift implementation.

The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Unsafe e-bike batteries sparked the blaze. Council Member Powers leads a bill to swap out dangerous batteries. Mayor Adams hesitates, citing costs. Delivery workers face risk. The Council demands action. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 949, a City Council bill, seeks to buy back unsafe e-bike batteries and provide safe replacements at low or no cost. The bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, has support from 33 Council members. It follows a deadly Chinatown fire on June 21, 2023, that killed four people. The bill is in committee, with Powers urging Mayor Adams and the FDNY to support it, stating, 'There is a clear consensus that a battery swap program will save lives.' Mayor Adams questioned the program's cost and called for federal, state, and Council funding. FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh backed the need for safe batteries for delivery workers. The Council's push comes as battery fires rise, endangering workers and residents. The bill has broad coalition support, but City Hall has not fully committed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

These bills, sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers, would require the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Sanitation, and FDNY to run a buyback program for safe lithium-ion batteries and mandate companies provide fireproof charging containers. The matter title calls on delivery app companies to 'step up' and protect workers from deadly battery fires. Powers declared, 'We're failing as policy makers if we're not protecting folks from that.' Assistant Commissioner Carlos Ortiz and FDNY Code Counsel Julian Bazel testified in support. Both bills have majority Council backing. The Adams administration supports the spirit of the buyback. Delivery workers, mostly low-income immigrants, face high costs for safe batteries and deadly risk from unsafe ones. In 2023 alone, 63 lithium-ion fires caused 52 injuries and five deaths. The Council’s action targets this systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure was brought before the City Council and discussed at a City Hall press conference. The matter summary states the bill 'goes after the unscrupulous used car dealers profiting considerably off a huge black market for phony tags.' Restler, as a sponsor, joins efforts to curb the spread of ghost cars, which evade speed cameras and tolls, making streets more dangerous for everyone.
