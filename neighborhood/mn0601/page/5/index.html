No one has died in a crash here since 2022. But the wounds keep coming. In the last twelve months, 55 people were hurt in 94 crashes, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Two were seriously injured. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. An 11-year-old boy, crossing Avenue C, left with a broken leg. A 90-year-old man, struck by a taxi, bruised and shaken. A woman, crossing with the light, cut and shocked by a turning cab. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h3><p>Cars, SUVs, and taxis do most of the damage. In the last three years, these vehicles left 18 pedestrians with injuries—one with wounds so deep they would not heal soon. Bikes and mopeds hurt fewer, but the scars remain. The city blames distraction, confusion, bad views. But the pain lands on flesh and bone. A child, &ldquo;incoherent&rdquo; after a crash. A woman, &ldquo;unconscious&rdquo; and bleeding at the curb. The stories repeat, only the names change.</p><h3 id=leaders-actor-wait>Leaders Act—Or Wait</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Assembly Member Harvey Epstein <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored a bill</a> to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the same bill</a>, aiming to stop the worst offenders. But the streets are still waiting. Council Member Keith Powers <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>called for using idle congestion pricing cameras</a> to catch speeders and ghost plates, but the equipment sits unused. The city talks of safety, but the work is slow, and the cost is paid in blood.</p><h3 id=the-words-that-linger>The Words That Linger</h3><p>&ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>said a community board leader</a>. But the lanes are cut, the sidewalks crowded, and the danger remains. After a crash, the city blames confusion, distraction, anything but the street itself. The only thing that changes is the date.</p><h3 id=demand-morenow>Demand More—Now</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to finish the job: lower the speed limit, redesign the streets, use every tool to stop the next crash before it happens. Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary states: 'New laws are set to finally tackle the scourge of unsightly sidewalk construction sheds and scaffolding structures around the city.' Powers said, 'This package of legislation puts forward reforms to fundamentally change our approach to scaffolding while ensuring safety is still the top priority.' Bottcher added, 'It’s time we cut back the endless sidewalk sheds that block our light.'

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.

The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds.
