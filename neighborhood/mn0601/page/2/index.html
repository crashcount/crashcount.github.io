But the streets did not spare the flesh. In the last twelve months, 52 people were injured in crashes across Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village. One was hurt so badly the wound was called serious. Most were younger than fifty. Some were children. Some were old. None were safe. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-never-breaks>The Pattern Never Breaks</h3><p>Crashes keep coming. In just the past year, there were 87 crashes. Taxis, sedans, SUVs, bikes. The machines change, the pain does not. A 31-year-old woman, crossing with the light, was cut down by a taxi at 1st Avenue and 22nd Street. She left the intersection with deep wounds and shock. A 78-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, was struck by a bike and left with a broken arm. The old and the young, all at risk. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>recent crash records</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They pass laws like Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is not yet 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is a gamble with someone’s life. <a href=../../take_action/>Demand action now</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The crisis is not fate. It is policy. It is speed. It is the choice to wait. The numbers will not stop climbing until leaders act. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Systemic danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the Adams administration launched the NYC e-bike trade-in program. No bill number or committee is listed, but the $2-million program stems from a 2023 bill by Council Member Keith Powers. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'The Adams administration is both cracking down on e-bikes and providing safer e-bikes to workers.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'This is not just about protecting delivery workers. It’s about protecting them, their families, their neighbors, and all New Yorkers from deadly fires.' Delivery worker William Medina praised the program, but called for expansion. The program lets workers trade uncertified bikes or illegal mopeds for certified e-bikes, but covers only a fraction of the city’s 80,000 delivery workers. The safety analyst notes: Cracking down may burden vulnerable users, while safer bikes help; mixed signals mean no clear safety gain. The city’s approach leaves vulnerable road users in limbo.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
