But the numbers do not comfort. Seventy-nine people were hurt in 103 crashes in the last twelve months alone. Not one was called a serious injury, but pain lingers. Limps last. The body remembers. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Crashes do not spare the young. Three children were injured. The most battered age group: 35 to 44, with 27 injuries. The streets do not care who you are. They take what they want.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>Cars and trucks did most of the harm. In the last three years, they killed two people and left dozens more bleeding. Bikes and mopeds were not spared either. One cyclist was killed. Trucks, sedans, SUVs, bikes—they all left marks. The street is a battlefield, and the weapons are steel and speed.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City Hall claims progress. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit has not dropped yet. The law sits unused. The cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Each delay is another roll of the dice.</p><p>No local leader has stood up to demand more for Sunnyside Yards (North). No council member has called for urgent redesigns or a citywide 20 mph limit. The silence is loud. The danger is louder.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every injury is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking. Do not wait for the next crash. Do not let another family join the count.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
