But the numbers do not comfort. Seventy-nine people were hurt in 103 crashes in the last twelve months alone. Not one was called a serious injury, but pain lingers. Limps last. The body remembers. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Crashes do not spare the young. Three children were injured. The most battered age group: 35 to 44, with 27 injuries. The streets do not care who you are. They take what they want.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>Cars and trucks did most of the harm. In the last three years, they killed two people and left dozens more bleeding. Bikes and mopeds were not spared either. One cyclist was killed. Trucks, sedans, SUVs, bikes—they all left marks. The street is a battlefield, and the weapons are steel and speed.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City Hall claims progress. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit has not dropped yet. The law sits unused. The cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Each delay is another roll of the dice.</p><p>No local leader has stood up to demand more for Sunnyside Yards (North). No council member has called for urgent redesigns or a citywide 20 mph limit. The silence is loud. The danger is louder.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every injury is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking. Do not wait for the next crash. Do not let another family join the count.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, covered on September 18, 2023, drew over 200 residents and was organized by Western Queens elected officials. The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal. No formal bill number or committee was cited; the event focused on immediate community engagement and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill stated: “Pedestrians may cross any roadway at any point, including outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk, and allow for crossing against traffic signals. It would legalize the activity commonly referred to as ‘jaywalking’ and specify that no penalties can be imposed for jaywalking.” Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Narcisse, Won, Farías, Hanif, Ayala, Richardson Jordan, Krishnan, and Nurse. The bill superseded state law and removed penalties for pedestrian movement. Filed at session’s end, it did not advance. Vulnerable road users still face the same risks at crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
