But the numbers do not comfort. Seventy-nine people were hurt in 103 crashes in the last twelve months alone. Not one was called a serious injury, but pain lingers. Limps last. The body remembers.

They take what they want.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>Cars and trucks did most of the harm. In the last three years, they killed two people and left dozens more bleeding. Bikes and mopeds were not spared either. One cyclist was killed. Trucks, sedans, SUVs, bikes—they all left marks. The street is a battlefield, and the weapons are steel and speed.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City Hall claims progress. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit has not dropped yet. The law sits unused. The cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Each delay is another roll of the dice.</p><p>No local leader has stood up to demand more for Sunnyside Yards (North). No council member has called for urgent redesigns or a citywide 20 mph limit. The silence is loud. The danger is louder.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every injury is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking.

Do not let another family join the count.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The truck was responding to a call with lights and sirens. The victim, reportedly in his 50s, was pronounced dead at the scene after being trapped under the rear wheels. Photos showed the aftermath, with sheets covering the truck’s back wheels. A witness told the Post, “We stopped at the red light and there was the FDNY truck...

Prosecutors revealed Pena had '25 tickets for speeding in school zones' in recent years. Surveillance showed both cars spinning out after the crash; Diaz died at Elmhurst Hospital. Pena tested positive for cocaine, marijuana, and had a blood-alcohol content of 0.156%. He faces 14 charges, including manslaughter and DWI. Diaz’s family called for stronger laws, with his mother stating, 'They need to look at the laws and see that people need to be charged accordingly.' Pena’s license was suspended and he was remanded to Rikers. The case highlights repeated driver violations and questions about enforcement and bail policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The discussion, reported by nydailynews.com, centered on Valdez's support for measures like a Vehicle-miles Traveled fee and charging for on-street parking. The article quotes, 'Her op-ed is filled with proposals/ideas for how to make drivers pay for subway improvements.' Letters from readers, including Thomas Murawski and Thomas Bower, accused Valdez of unfairly targeting drivers and ignoring the needs of workers without transit options. Valdez was mentioned, not directly quoted, in the backlash. No formal council bill or vote was involved.

The city must weigh the cost—and the gains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2025, a policy analysis by Charles Komanoff examined the impact of fare-free buses in New York City. The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips. The report adds fuel to the debate over city funding for free bus service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
