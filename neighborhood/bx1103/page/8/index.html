In Pelham Gardens, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Zero people killed. Ninety-two injured in the last year.</strong> Children, elders, workers. The wounds are spread across ages—ten children hurt, two elders over 75, and no one spared by luck or habit. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City crash data</a></p><p><strong>No one walks away untouched.</strong> In the past twelve months, there have been 140 crashes.

The street keeps its silence.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do the most harm.</strong> In three years, SUVs killed one, left nine with moderate injuries. No deaths from bikes. No deaths from motorcycles.

The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets New York lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders. But in Pelham Gardens, the pace of change is slow. The council can act. The mayor can act. The state can act. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><p>No new laws from the local council. No bold redesigns. The silence is loud. The danger is louder.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. These are choices. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand safer crossings. The state can keep speed cameras running. <strong>But only if you demand it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill sits with the Assembly. Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Catalina Cruz. Their action signals strong legislative momentum. The bill’s focus: force planners to build streets for people, not just cars. No safety analyst note is available, but the intent is clear—systemic change for vulnerable road users.
