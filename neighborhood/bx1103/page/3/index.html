The bill, sponsored by Deborah Glick with co-sponsors Jo Anne Simon, John Zaccaro Jr., Linda Rosenthal, and Tony Simone, was introduced on April 16, 2025. It 'permits the use of photo speed violation monitoring systems in New York City for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction, concealment, and/or distortion; extends provisions permitting the use of speed cameras in certain school zones.' By targeting plate obstruction, the bill seeks to stop drivers from dodging speed camera enforcement, a move that could help protect pedestrians and cyclists from repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, a licensed female operating a 2012 Nissan SUV, was making a left turn when the collision occurred. The point of impact was the vehicle's left front bumper. The pedestrian sustained abrasions and injuries to her knee, lower leg, and foot. The report identifies 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Passing Too Closely' as contributing factors attributed to the driver. No damage was reported to the vehicle, and the pedestrian was conscious after the crash. The pedestrian was crossing without a signal, but the police report does not list this as a contributing factor. The collision highlights driver errors in speed management and vehicle positioning during a turn.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Steel scraped concrete. Debris rained down. No one was hurt. The wall broke. The rules broke first.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on January 17, 2025, that a BxM1 MTA bus nearly plunged from the Henry Hudson Parkway overpass after the driver swerved to avoid an illegally double-parked car. The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
