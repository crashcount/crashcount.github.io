In Pelham Gardens, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Zero people killed. Ninety-two injured in the last year.</strong> Children, elders, workers. The wounds are spread across ages—ten children hurt, two elders over 75, and no one spared by luck or habit. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City crash data</a></p><p><strong>No one walks away untouched.</strong> In the past twelve months, there have been 140 crashes. Not one death this year, but the injuries keep coming. A boy, 11, thrown from his scooter. A woman, 46, left with bleeding arms. The street keeps its silence.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do the most harm.</strong> In three years, SUVs killed one, left nine with moderate injuries. No deaths from bikes. No deaths from motorcycles. The danger rolls on four wheels, heavy and fast. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a></p><p>Pedestrians are not safe in the crosswalk.

The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets New York lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders. But in Pelham Gardens, the pace of change is slow. The council can act. The mayor can act. The state can act. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><p>No new laws from the local council. No bold redesigns. The silence is loud. The danger is louder.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. These are choices. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand safer crossings. The state can keep speed cameras running. <strong>But only if you demand it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The NYPD’s policy restricts chases to serious crimes and discourages them in residential areas, yet the pursuit occurred near homes and a bodega. The department declined to comment.

The bill, sponsored by Deborah Glick with co-sponsors Jo Anne Simon, John Zaccaro Jr., Linda Rosenthal, and Tony Simone, was introduced on April 16, 2025. It 'permits the use of photo speed violation monitoring systems in New York City for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction, concealment, and/or distortion; extends provisions permitting the use of speed cameras in certain school zones.' By targeting plate obstruction, the bill seeks to stop drivers from dodging speed camera enforcement, a move that could help protect pedestrians and cyclists from repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both vehicles impacted center front ends. The 20-year-old male bicyclist was ejected from his e-bike and sustained abrasions and injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot, resulting in shock. The report cites 'View Obstructed/Limited' as a contributing factor, indicating driver visibility issues played a role. The SUV driver was licensed and traveling straight ahead, as was the bicyclist. No other contributing factors or victim behaviors were noted. This crash underscores the risks posed by obstructed views in vehicle-bicycle interactions, with the driver’s limited visibility a critical element in the collision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The law demands the Department of Transportation install pavement markings or temporary lines within five business days after any street resurfacing. If DOT misses the deadline, it must notify the public and explain the delay. The bill’s matter title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing pavement markings.' Council Member Farah N. Louis led as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Schulman, Banks, Farías, Carr, and Ariola. The law took effect March 15, 2025.

The driver’s unsafe speed and passing too closely contributed to the collision in the Bronx late at night.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 28-year-old female pedestrian was injured while crossing a marked crosswalk at the intersection of Astor Ave and Bruner Ave in the Bronx at 11:07 PM. The driver, a licensed female operating a 2012 Nissan SUV, was making a left turn when the collision occurred. The point of impact was the vehicle's left front bumper. The pedestrian sustained abrasions and injuries to her knee, lower leg, and foot. The report identifies 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Passing Too Closely' as contributing factors attributed to the driver. No damage was reported to the vehicle, and the pedestrian was conscious after the crash. The pedestrian was crossing without a signal, but the police report does not list this as a contributing factor. The collision highlights driver errors in speed management and vehicle positioning during a turn.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
