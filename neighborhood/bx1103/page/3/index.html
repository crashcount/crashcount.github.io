In Pelham Gardens, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Zero people killed. Ninety-two injured in the last year.</strong> Children, elders, workers. The wounds are spread across ages—ten children hurt, two elders over 75, and no one spared by luck or habit. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City crash data</a></p><p><strong>No one walks away untouched.</strong> In the past twelve months, there have been 140 crashes.

The street keeps its silence.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do the most harm.</strong> In three years, SUVs killed one, left nine with moderate injuries. No deaths from bikes. No deaths from motorcycles.

The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets New York lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders. But in Pelham Gardens, the pace of change is slow. The council can act. The mayor can act. The state can act. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><p>No new laws from the local council. No bold redesigns. The silence is loud. The danger is louder.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. These are choices. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand safer crossings. The state can keep speed cameras running. <strong>But only if you demand it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Richards opposes lifting mandates in Queens, citing poor transit. Marmorato lobbied to restore mandates in a Bronx rezoning near new Metro North stations, arguing, 'We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities.' The editorial rebukes this logic, stating, 'We should not cling to parking mandates when we know they encourage car ownership, make streets less vibrant, increase rents, and pollute our air.' The piece urges officials to break the cycle of car-first policy, invest in transit, and end mandates that block affordable housing and safer streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the editorial centers the harm parking mandates inflict on vulnerable road users and the city’s livability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, part of the Mayor's 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' plan, aimed to boost affordable housing and transit-oriented development.

The matter, titled 'Transit-Oriented Bronx Developments Will Have Ample Parking, Developers Tell Council,' focused on whether to require parking in new residential and commercial projects. Council Members Amanda Faris, Kevin C. Riley, Rafael Salamanca, and Kristy Marmorato all pressed for developers to include parking, despite the city's move to waive mandates. Riley called parking 'a huge issue.' Developers, including Baker Development, promised up to 200 spaces per project. Bronx City Planning Director Paul Philips said, 'We certainly expect developers to provide parking.' The debate ignored the danger more parking brings: more cars, more conflict, more risk for people walking and biking.

The measure creates a pilot program to install speed cameras near schools, aiming to catch drivers who exceed posted limits. The authorization for the program expires December 31, 2028. Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push. The vote passed with strong support but faced opposition from several members. The bill’s summary reads: "Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2028." No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the measure targets driver speed in zones where children walk, bike, and cross.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would require the Department of Transportation to paint a symbol in the street across from each fire hydrant. The official summary states: 'These markings are intended to allow the Fire Department to find the nearest fire hydrant quickly when responding to an emergency.' Council Member Joann Ariola is the primary sponsor, joined by Kristy Marmorato, Inna Vernikov, Vickie Paladino, and Robert F. Holden as co-sponsors. The bill is still in committee and has not yet been scheduled for a vote. There is no safety analyst note or documented impact for vulnerable road users in the available records.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installation of pedestrian lighting fixtures,' would require the transportation commissioner to install sidewalk lighting in at least 500 commercial corridors per year, each lit to a minimum of 1 footcandle (11 lux). At least 450 corridors must be contiguous to others with new or existing lighting. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Krishnan, Bottcher, and many others. The bill aims to cut through the city’s darkness, demanding light for those on foot. It remains stalled in committee, its promise unrealized.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
