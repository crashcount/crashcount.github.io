In Pelham Gardens, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Zero people killed. Ninety-two injured in the last year.</strong> Children, elders, workers. The wounds are spread across ages—ten children hurt, two elders over 75, and no one spared by luck or habit. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City crash data</a></p><p><strong>No one walks away untouched.</strong> In the past twelve months, there have been 140 crashes.

The street keeps its silence.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do the most harm.</strong> In three years, SUVs killed one, left nine with moderate injuries. No deaths from bikes. No deaths from motorcycles. The danger rolls on four wheels, heavy and fast. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a></p><p>Pedestrians are not safe in the crosswalk.

The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets New York lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders. But in Pelham Gardens, the pace of change is slow. The council can act. The mayor can act. The state can act. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><p>No new laws from the local council. No bold redesigns. The silence is loud. The danger is louder.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. These are choices. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand safer crossings. The state can keep speed cameras running. <strong>But only if you demand it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

According to the MTA, crews will completely rebuild Williams Bridge and Woodlawn, installing four new elevators—two at each station—to ensure full accessibility. The matter summary states: 'comprehensive renovation and accessibility project at three Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line stations in the Bronx.' Christian Murray reported the announcement. No council bill number or committee applies, as this is an agency initiative, not legislation. The upgrades promise to open transit to riders long shut out by stairs and barriers. Improving station accessibility encourages more walking and cycling to transit, supports mode shift away from driving, and benefits vulnerable users by making the built environment more inclusive and safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The endorsement, reported by Streetsblog NYC and covered by Gersh Kuntzman, followed a review of candidate plans. StreetsPAC called Lander’s proposal 'by far the most comprehensive blueprint ... we've ever seen from a candidate for any office.' Lander promised more protected bike lanes, a citywide Bus Rapid Transit network, and using congestion pricing revenue for busways and bikeways. He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users.
