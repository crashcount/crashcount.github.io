DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez asked council members for input; only six of 51 replied. Council Member Gale Brewer cited ignored past outreach. Joe Borelli dismissed bike lanes and DOT’s efforts. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers insisted the agency, not lawmakers, must pick locations. The city is failing to meet legal benchmarks for new lanes.
