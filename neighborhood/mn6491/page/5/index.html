State Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Jeremy Cooney said, "I continue to believe this is an issue that can’t wait until next year’s session." The legislature ended its session without a plan to replace lost toll revenue. Hochul promised to address the shortfall in the 2025 budget. Assemblyman Eddie Gibbs praised Hochul’s commitment to East Harlem, while Rep. Adriano Espaillat thanked her for the funding. Critics warned the $54 million is a drop in the bucket. The MTA’s $70 billion capital plan hangs in the balance. No immediate relief for transit riders or vulnerable road users. The system remains at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jeremy Cooney calls out Governor Hochul. He demands a 100-day plan to fill the $16.5 billion MTA gap left by her congestion pricing pause. Projects for safer, more accessible transit hang in the balance. Albany leaders mostly stay silent.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, State Sen. Jeremy Cooney, new chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, issued a public demand for Governor Hochul to deliver a '100-day plan' to replace the $16.5 billion MTA funding shortfall caused by her cancellation of congestion pricing. In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of funding jeopardizes projects vital to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority.

The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move leaves the MTA’s future in limbo. Board members and city officials push back. Billions for transit hang in the balance. No clear plan replaces lost funds.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul revoked her support for congestion pricing, a policy set to start June 30. The delay, announced without legislative action, sparked backlash. MTA Board member Midori Valdivia vowed, 'I'm going to vote yes to congestion pricing, and that it should start as soon as possible.' Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi echoed, 'It needs to happen now.' Senator Liz Krueger called Hochul's move 'a staggering error.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll and business leader Kathy Wylde criticized the governor’s floated payroll tax hike as unfair to city businesses. The MTA faces a $15 billion shortfall, with no replacement funding in sight. The delay keeps streets clogged and transit underfunded, risking more danger for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
