Not for the old, not for the young. Not for the cyclist, not for the walker. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and three were seriously injured</strong> here. Fifty-one more were hurt. The numbers do not tell you about the sound of bone on asphalt, or the blood that stains the crosswalk. But they are the record of a city that looks away.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a man on a bike died on the 97th Street Transverse. He was 43. The crash report lists him as ejected, dead at the scene. No further detail. No comfort for his family. No change for the next rider. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A child was hit at Central Park West and 85th. The report says &ldquo;failure to yield right-of-way&rdquo; and &ldquo;unsafe speed.&rdquo; She survived, but with severe lacerations to the head. She was crossing with the signal. The driver was on a bike. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=the-voices-in-the-silence>The Voices in the Silence</h3><p>The dead do not speak. The living do. After a cyclist was struck in Washington Heights, a resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> Another added, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</a></p><p>The horror is not just in the crash. It is in the waiting. It is in the knowledge that nothing will change until someone makes it change.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—and What They Haven&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill that would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a> Assembly Member Micah Lasher voted to extend school speed zones. These are steps. But the blood still runs. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not done so.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the power they have. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people who walk and ride. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, designed to charge most drivers $15 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street, would have funded $15 billion in MTA capital improvements. The bill’s summary warns: 'No plan B for transit investments should congestion pricing not go through.' Senator Liz Krueger, mentioned in the debate, criticized the lack of alternative funding, saying, 'She is not aware of what she is referring to or where she believes that money will come from.' The delay leaves critical projects—like subway accessibility, new signals, and electric buses—unfunded. Without this money, vulnerable riders face more delays, breakdowns, and unsafe conditions. The City Council and transit advocates express deep disappointment and concern for New York’s future.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged. Vulnerable road users are left exposed as transit funding falters.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter at hand: 'Gov. Hochul revoked her support for congestion pricing less than a month before it was supposed to start.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll also criticized the governor, rejecting her proposal to hike the payroll mobility tax on city businesses. The MTA’s capital plan now faces a $15 billion shortfall, with no replacement funding in sight.

The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk.

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, follows years of parent-led advocacy. The measure excludes major multi-lane roads but targets most city streets. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2024, state lawmakers advanced legislation enabling New York City to reduce its default speed limit to 20 mph. The measure, known as Sammy’s Law, is part of the state budget deal and awaits final publication. Sponsored by Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal and Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, the bill allows the City Council to set lower limits on most streets, but excludes roads with three or more lanes in one direction. The bill’s title honors Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a speeding driver in 2013. Rosenthal said, “This is about trying to eliminate all unnecessary deaths, and one of the ways you do that is by making the speed limit lower.” Hoylman-Sigal credited persistent advocacy by Sammy’s mother and Families for Safe Streets. The City Council and Mayor must still approve the change. Advocates and city officials say the law gives New York City a vital tool to prevent traffic violence and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
