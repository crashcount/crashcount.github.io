Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2023, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and other NYC officials lobbied the state legislature to pass key transportation and housing bills before the session ends June 9. The centerpiece is 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let New York City set its own speed limits, potentially lowering them to 20 mph. Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted. Mayor Adams’ administration also pushed for affordable housing reforms. The push for Sammy’s Law is a fight to give NYC control over its streets and protect vulnerable road users from deadly speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Marjorie Velázquez, Sandy Nurse, Kevin C. Riley, and Gale A. Brewer backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote.

The Independent Budget Office found $1.02 billion in unpaid traffic fines from 2017 to 2022, including camera tickets for speeding and red lights. The matter, titled 'Ticket to slide: NYC owed more than $1 billion in unpaid parking, speeding fines, report finds,' highlights growing debt as enforcement lags. Adams, along with Comptroller Brad Lander, criticized further city agency budget cuts, urging the city to collect owed fines instead. The report notes that while 24/7 school-zone speed cameras have reduced speeding, the city has failed to stop drivers from evading cameras with defaced or fake plates—letting dangerous drivers escape accountability. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, State Sen. Jessica Ramos and colleagues sent a letter to city and state DOTs urging action against the 'demonization' of e-bikes and e-scooters. The letter, signed by Ramos and State Sen. Liz Krueger, demanded more education on safe riding and battery use, warning, 'We cannot allow a narrative to build against a vital, green, and growing mode of transportation.' Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries. The senators warned that inaction could lead to blanket bans, hitting delivery workers hardest. The city’s plan for safe charging hubs faces local opposition. DOT claims a 'holistic approach,' but vulnerable riders remain at risk as agencies drag their feet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Delivery workers’ safety and livelihoods hung in the balance. Lawmakers targeted sellers, not riders. The bills aimed to stop deadly fires without punishing those who rely on e-bikes to survive.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, the New York City Council advanced a package of lithium-ion battery safety bills. Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'A woman crossed without a signal. The e-scooter struck her face. The taxi stood still. Her body crumpled. Crush wounds. No helmet. No warning.' The woman suffered facial injuries and was in shock. The e-scooter driver, a 40-year-old man, was cited for 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The taxi was parked and not involved in the impact. The report notes the pedestrian was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s inattention. The crash shows how distraction behind the handlebars endangers those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
