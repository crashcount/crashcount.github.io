A cyclist rounds a bend. A horse breaks loose. The city calls it a park, but the numbers say otherwise. <strong>In the last twelve months, 35 people were injured here. One was seriously hurt.</strong> No one died, this time. But the tally grows.</p><p>A crash between two horse-drawn carriages sent both drivers to the hospital. The police said the operators would recover. The horses, too. But the scars run deeper. The animal advocacy group NY Class used the moment to demand a ban on carriage horses. The city has not answered. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/collision-between-horse-drawn-carriages-central-park-sends-operators-hospital/16559383/>Police say the operators are expected to be okay, and the horses were not severely injured.</a></p><p>A week before, a horse ran wild through the park. Pedestrians jumped fences. Cyclists shouted warnings. Hayley was there: <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/19/us-news/central-park-horse-runs-wild-without-driver-in-shocking-video/>&ldquo;I was there with my friend walking on the sidewalk and almost got trampled by the poor horse. It was so terrifying.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=the-numbers-dont-lie>The Numbers Don’t Lie</h2><p><strong>From 2022 to now, 217 people have been injured in 383 crashes in Central Park. Six were seriously hurt. One died.</strong> The deadliest machines are not the ones you expect. Trucks killed. Cars and SUVs maimed. Bikes and mopeds left blood on the pavement. The young are not spared. Four children were hurt in the last year alone.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-not-deeds>Leadership: Words, Not Deeds</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. It talks about safety. But the park remains a gauntlet. No new laws. No new protections. The horses run. The cars speed. The people bleed. The silence from City Hall is louder than the sirens.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand lower speeds. Demand real protection for people, not cars. Demand an end to the slow violence. Don’t wait for the next name to be carved into stone.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
