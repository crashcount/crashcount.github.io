A car strikes him. A child walks behind a parked car. An SUV hits him. In three and a half years, one person is dead, three are seriously hurt, and 355 are injured on the streets of Kew Gardens Hills. The numbers do not flinch. One death. Three lives changed forever. Hundreds left with wounds. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The last twelve months saw one death and one serious injury. The year before, there were none. The pain does not fade. It waits at the curb, at the crosswalk, at the school gate.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p>Children are not spared. Sixteen under 18 were hurt in the last year. The old are not spared. Five over 75. The middle-aged, the young, the old—no one walks these streets untouched. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Sedans and SUVs caused every pedestrian death and all serious injuries. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes did not kill or seriously injure a single person here. The danger is heavy, fast, and steel-bound.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p>The city claims progress. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law allows the city to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Kew Gardens Hills, the blood still runs. No local leader has stood in the street and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo; No council vote, no press release, no new redesign for these blocks. The silence is loud. The danger is routine.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crosswalks can be built. Cameras can be kept on.

Resolution urges Albany to add e-bikes. The measure targets hit-and-runs that leave victims behind. It sits in the Transportation Committee. Lawmakers want accountability when vulnerable road users are struck.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0231-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced March 7, 2024. The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.1679/S.561. The matter title states it aims to 'increase the penalty for leaving the scene of an accident involving an e-scooter and further calling upon the NYS Legislature to include e-bikes in such legislation.' Council Members James F. Gennaro (primary sponsor, District 24) and Gale A. Brewer (co-sponsor, District 6) put their names to the measure. The bill would raise penalties for fleeing e-scooter crashes from a violation to a Class-A misdemeanor, and for more serious cases, to a Class-E felony. The resolution also urges lawmakers to include e-bikes. The council’s action seeks to close loopholes and ensure drivers who harm vulnerable road users face consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He calls for digital mirrors on trucks in state commerce. These systems cut blind spots. They use cameras, not glass. The resolution sits in committee. No vote yet. Streets wait.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0244-2024, sponsored by Council Member James F. Gennaro, was introduced on March 7, 2024, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution urges the New York State Legislature to 'adopt the same exemptions as FMCSA for approved digital mirror systems with respect to operation in intrastate commerce.' The federal FMCSA allows digital mirror systems in place of traditional mirrors for interstate trucks, citing improved field of vision and blind spot elimination. New York State does not yet allow these systems for trucks operating only within the state. Gennaro’s action aims to align state law with federal safety standards, which the FMCSA says may offer equal or greater safety than old mirrors. The measure remains in committee, awaiting further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
