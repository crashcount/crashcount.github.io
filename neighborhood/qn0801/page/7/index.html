A car strikes him. A child walks behind a parked car. An SUV hits him. In three and a half years, one person is dead, three are seriously hurt, and 355 are injured on the streets of Kew Gardens Hills. The numbers do not flinch. One death. Three lives changed forever. Hundreds left with wounds. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The last twelve months saw one death and one serious injury. The year before, there were none. The pain does not fade. It waits at the curb, at the crosswalk, at the school gate.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p>Children are not spared. Sixteen under 18 were hurt in the last year. The old are not spared. Five over 75. The middle-aged, the young, the old—no one walks these streets untouched. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Sedans and SUVs caused every pedestrian death and all serious injuries. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes did not kill or seriously injure a single person here. The danger is heavy, fast, and steel-bound.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p>The city claims progress. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law allows the city to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Kew Gardens Hills, the blood still runs. No local leader has stood in the street and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo; No council vote, no press release, no new redesign for these blocks. The silence is loud. The danger is routine.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crosswalks can be built. Cameras can be kept on. But only if you demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real protection.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff.

The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily.
