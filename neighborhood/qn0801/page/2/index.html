A car strikes him. A child walks behind a parked car. An SUV hits him. In three and a half years, one person is dead, three are seriously hurt, and 355 are injured on the streets of Kew Gardens Hills. The numbers do not flinch. One death. Three lives changed forever. Hundreds left with wounds. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The last twelve months saw one death and one serious injury. The year before, there were none. The pain does not fade. It waits at the curb, at the crosswalk, at the school gate.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p>Children are not spared. Sixteen under 18 were hurt in the last year. The old are not spared. Five over 75. The middle-aged, the young, the old—no one walks these streets untouched. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Sedans and SUVs caused every pedestrian death and all serious injuries. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes did not kill or seriously injure a single person here. The danger is heavy, fast, and steel-bound.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p>The city claims progress. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law allows the city to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Kew Gardens Hills, the blood still runs. No local leader has stood in the street and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo; No council vote, no press release, no new redesign for these blocks. The silence is loud. The danger is routine.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crosswalks can be built. Cameras can be kept on.

Prosecutors allege Peña was drunk, high, and speeding at 83 mph—three times the limit—when he ran a red light and T-boned 23-year-old Justin Diaz’s car. Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield. The victim, Diaz, was headed to work and had just graduated college.

The bill sits at the sponsorship stage and has not yet faced a committee or floor vote. The measure, titled 'Relates to establishing a "yellow alert system" for law enforcement to publicize vehicle information in instances of hit-and-run accidents,' aims to help police track down drivers who kill and flee. Comrie’s bill would require law enforcement to quickly share vehicle information after fatal hit-and-runs. The text reads: 'Establishes a "yellow alert system" for law enforcement to publicize vehicle information in instances of hit-and-run accidents in which a person has been killed.' No safety analyst has yet assessed the bill’s impact on vulnerable road users.
