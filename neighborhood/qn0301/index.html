He was drunk, police said. He killed a 23-year-old man. The city suspended him for 28 days. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/26/man-24-behind-wheel-of-bmw-fatally-struck-by-queens-mercedes-driver/>FDNY stated Pena will be suspended without pay for 28 days during the investigation.</a></p><p>On 34th Avenue, a 21-year-old was killed when a motorcycle ran a light. A 17-year-old passenger was thrown from the bike, bleeding. The street is a gauntlet. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They pass laws like Sammy’s Law, letting the city lower speed limits. But the limit is not yet lowered. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another risk. Each promise is another family waiting for the call.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action><strong>Act Now: Demand Action</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your council member.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.'

The proposal, discussed at a heated community board meeting, remains active and is set for installation after summer repaving. Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas endorsed the plan in a letter, stating it would 'protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.' DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward.

The plan, discussed with Council Member Shekar Krishnan and groups like the Alliance for Paseo Park, aims to move fast e-bikes and mopeds to a new lane on Northern Boulevard. The matter summary reads: 'Supporters of the 34th Avenue open street hope design changes can help calm the strip and redirect faster riders to a safer Northern Boulevard.' Dawn Siff and Jim Burke spoke for more park space and bike access. The safety analyst warns: 'Redirecting faster riders away from an open street may discourage cycling and reduce safety in numbers, while failing to address the root causes of unsafe speeds through infrastructure or traffic calming for all users.' The redesign risks pushing danger elsewhere, not solving it.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cars keep two lanes. Buses lose out. Cyclists get nothing. Sidewalks widen, but most space stays with traffic. Critics say safety for walkers and riders is left behind.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the city's announcement of a $550 million redesign for Fifth Avenue. The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets demand action.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 4045, titled 'Relates to requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits,' advanced in the Senate on May 20, 2025, following a committee vote. The bill requires drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red-light camera tickets in twelve months, to install intelligent speed assistance devices. Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes led the push, joined by co-sponsors Samra Brouk, Cordell Cleare, and others. The vote passed with support from senators including Jeremy Cooney, Pete Harckham, and Jessica Ramos. The measure aims to rein in repeat offenders and reduce deadly speeding. The bill’s language is blunt: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.'

The bill, titled "Relates to repealing congestion pricing (Part A); and commissioning an independent audit of the metropolitan transportation authority (Part B)," was sponsored by Jack M.
