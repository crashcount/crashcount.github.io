Two girls, ages four and eight, were walking in the crosswalk. The SUV went around another car and hit them. The driver fled. The girls survived. Their injuries were called minor. But a child’s wound is never minor. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls were taken to Elmhurst Hospital. The driver is still out there.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, Jackson Heights saw 330 people injured and 4 seriously hurt in crashes. One person died.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians all bled on these streets. The numbers do not rest. They do not lie.</p><h3 id=red-lights-broken-lives>Red Lights, Broken Lives</h3><p>A few months earlier, a firefighter ran a red light at Northern Boulevard and 107th Street. He was drunk, police said. He killed a 23-year-old man. The city suspended him for 28 days. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/26/man-24-behind-wheel-of-bmw-fatally-struck-by-queens-mercedes-driver/>FDNY stated Pena will be suspended without pay for 28 days during the investigation.</a></p><p>On 34th Avenue, a 21-year-old was killed when a motorcycle ran a light. A 17-year-old passenger was thrown from the bike, bleeding. The street is a gauntlet. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They pass laws like Sammy’s Law, letting the city lower speed limits. But the limit is not yet lowered. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another risk. Each promise is another family waiting for the call.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action><strong>Act Now: Demand Action</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where children can cross and come home.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

This follows a state bill signed last year mandating better conditions for cyclists.

MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber said, 'We want to improve customer access to our environmentally friendly MTA services, however they get to their train or bus.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas called bridge access 'a matter of environmental justice, public health, and labor justice.' The MTA has ended bike permits on LIRR and Metro-North and added bike parking at Grand Central, but its record on bike access remains mixed.

The bill aimed to establish an Office of Pedestrians, led by a mayoral appointee, to advise on safety and act as a bridge between walkers and city agencies. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the New York city charter, in relation to establishing an office of pedestrians.' Council Member Althea V. Stevens sponsored the bill, with Julie Won, Sandy Nurse, Shekar Krishnan, Lincoln Restler, and Carlina Rivera as co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. No safety analyst note was provided. The bill’s failure means no dedicated city office for pedestrian safety. The city keeps walking, unprotected.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring curb extensions at certain dangerous intersections,' was sponsored by Council Members Hanif (primary), Menin, Hudson, Stevens, Ayala, Abreu, Krishnan, Nurse, and Riley. The bill required the Department of Transportation to identify intersections with high pedestrian crash rates and install curb extensions—prohibiting parking within 15 feet of crosswalks—at a minimum of five such intersections in each borough per year. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Curb extensions are designed to increase pedestrian visibility and reduce deadly conflicts at crossings, directly targeting systemic dangers faced by people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety rises.</p><p class=mb3>On April 28, 2022, the Department of Transportation presented its final plan for 34th Avenue, now called Paseo Park, to Community Board 3. The plan, described as 'bold,' creates a 1.3-mile stretch where vehicles are guests on shared streets, with two blocks and five half-blocks fully pedestrianized. Councilmember Shekar Krishnan, who campaigned for this change, voiced strong support: 'This design improves pedestrian safety and expands accessibility for all people.' DOT officials committed to ongoing collaboration. Some Community Board 3 leaders raised concerns about transparency, scooters, disability access, and environmental review, but DOT called these minor and solvable. The plan has broad support from local advocates and is set to begin implementation in June, with more improvements in 2023. The move marks a major shift for Jackson Heights, prioritizing people over cars and setting a new standard for city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
