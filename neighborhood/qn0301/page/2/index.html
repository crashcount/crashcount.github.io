Two girls, ages four and eight, were walking in the crosswalk. The SUV went around another car and hit them. The driver fled. The girls survived. Their injuries were called minor. But a child’s wound is never minor. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls were taken to Elmhurst Hospital.

They do not lie.</p><h3 id=red-lights-broken-lives>Red Lights, Broken Lives</h3><p>A few months earlier, a firefighter ran a red light at Northern Boulevard and 107th Street. He was drunk, police said. He killed a 23-year-old man. The city suspended him for 28 days. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/26/man-24-behind-wheel-of-bmw-fatally-struck-by-queens-mercedes-driver/>FDNY stated Pena will be suspended without pay for 28 days during the investigation.</a></p><p>On 34th Avenue, a 21-year-old was killed when a motorcycle ran a light.

The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They pass laws like Sammy’s Law, letting the city lower speed limits. But the limit is not yet lowered. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another risk. Each promise is another family waiting for the call.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action><strong>Act Now: Demand Action</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your council member.

The crash killed 23-year-old Justin Diaz. Surveillance video showed Pena's Mercedes plowing into Diaz's BMW, which then struck a parked minivan. Pena refused a breath test and was uninjured. Two Mercedes passengers were hospitalized. The article notes, 'The FDNY stated Pena will be suspended without pay for 28 days during the investigation.' Video evidence indicated Diaz entered the intersection legally, with the pedestrian signal allowing crossing.
