They do not lie.</p><h3 id=red-lights-broken-lives>Red Lights, Broken Lives</h3><p>A few months earlier, a firefighter ran a red light at Northern Boulevard and 107th Street. He was drunk, police said. He killed a 23-year-old man. The city suspended him for 28 days. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/26/man-24-behind-wheel-of-bmw-fatally-struck-by-queens-mercedes-driver/>FDNY stated Pena will be suspended without pay for 28 days during the investigation.</a></p><p>On 34th Avenue, a 21-year-old was killed when a motorcycle ran a light. A 17-year-old passenger was thrown from the bike, bleeding. The street is a gauntlet. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They pass laws like Sammy’s Law, letting the city lower speed limits. But the limit is not yet lowered. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another risk. Each promise is another family waiting for the call.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action><strong>Act Now: Demand Action</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where children can cross and come home.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report cites "Unsafe Lane Changing" and "Other Vehicular" factors as contributing causes. One injured passenger, a 44-year-old woman seated in the middle front seat, suffered a head injury and concussion despite wearing a lap belt and harness. Another passenger, a 20-year-old man in the middle rear seat, sustained knee, lower leg, and foot injuries along with a concussion, also while restrained. The report notes the drivers were traveling straight ahead before impact, with damage to the left rear quarter panel of one SUV and the left front quarter panel of the other. One driver was licensed in New York, the other unlicensed.

Adam White, a lawyer for crash victims, said the DA should have insisted Barcia not drive. The rally highlighted rising road deaths—48 killed citywide in early 2024—and called out the city’s failure to protect its most vulnerable.

The driver, Jose Barcia, rushed a left turn from 31st Avenue and struck the children, according to NYPD Chief of Transportation Philip Rivera. Barcia faces charges of criminally negligent homicide, failure to yield, failure to exercise due care, and speeding. State Senator Jessica Ramos responded, calling for passage of 'Sammy's Law' to let the city set its own speed limits. Ramos said, 'I fight so hard for improved public transit because there are too many cars on the road, particularly SUVs and pickup trucks that do not allow for full visibility in city streets.' She urged fewer cars, especially large vehicles, and stressed the need for pedestrian safety in the budget. 31st Avenue, where the crash happened, saw 74 crashes and 47 injuries last year, far more than nearby, mostly car-free 34th Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Won, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Avilés, Abreu, Ossé, Krishnan, Williams, Cabán, Nurse, Sanchez, and the Brooklyn Borough President.

The study could expose the toll.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0113-2024 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 28, 2024, it orders the Department of Transportation to study how last mile delivery facilities batter local streets and communities. The bill summary reads: 'estimating the amount of delivery vehicles arriving at or departing from each facility, and the impact that additional vehicle traffic has on parking, street congestion, vehicle collisions and other traffic incidents.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Alexa Avilés, Shekar Krishnan, Amanda Farías, and over twenty others. The bill was referred to committee on the day it was introduced. No safety analyst has yet weighed in, but the bill’s focus is clear: count the trucks, count the crashes, and show the cost to people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
