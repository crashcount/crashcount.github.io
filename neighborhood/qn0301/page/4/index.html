Two girls, ages four and eight, were walking in the crosswalk. The SUV went around another car and hit them. The driver fled. The girls survived. Their injuries were called minor. But a child’s wound is never minor. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls were taken to Elmhurst Hospital. The driver is still out there.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, Jackson Heights saw 330 people injured and 4 seriously hurt in crashes. One person died.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians all bled on these streets. The numbers do not rest. They do not lie.</p><h3 id=red-lights-broken-lives>Red Lights, Broken Lives</h3><p>A few months earlier, a firefighter ran a red light at Northern Boulevard and 107th Street. He was drunk, police said. He killed a 23-year-old man. The city suspended him for 28 days. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/26/man-24-behind-wheel-of-bmw-fatally-struck-by-queens-mercedes-driver/>FDNY stated Pena will be suspended without pay for 28 days during the investigation.</a></p><p>On 34th Avenue, a 21-year-old was killed when a motorcycle ran a light. A 17-year-old passenger was thrown from the bike, bleeding. The street is a gauntlet. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They pass laws like Sammy’s Law, letting the city lower speed limits. But the limit is not yet lowered. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another risk. Each promise is another family waiting for the call.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action><strong>Act Now: Demand Action</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where children can cross and come home.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A sedan traveling west struck a bicyclist from behind, impacting the bike’s left side doors with the sedan’s right front quarter panel. The 19-year-old male bicyclist was injured, sustaining an upper arm and shoulder injury classified as severity 3. The bicyclist was conscious and not ejected from his bike. The report cites the sedan driver’s errors as 'Following Too Closely' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. No safety equipment or victim behaviors were noted as contributing factors.
