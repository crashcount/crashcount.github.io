He is 21, a passenger on a moped. The crash comes fast, the end comes faster. In three and a half years, Fresh Meadows-Utopia has seen <strong>1 killed, 4 seriously injured, and 255 hurt</strong> in 426 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Young people pay the price.</strong> In the last year, 13 children were hurt. One teenager, 16, thrown from a moped, left with a head wound. Another, 21, crushed in a five-car pileup. A woman, 48, bleeding from the head after her SUV is struck. These are not rare stories. They are routine.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In this district, sedans and SUVs are the main weapons. Trucks and mopeds follow. Bikes are not in the rollup. The street is a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-what-has-not>What Has Been Done, What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of safety.</strong> The city touts new speed limits, more cameras, and intersection redesigns. But on these streets, the pace of change is slow. The law allows for 20 mph limits, but most streets still run faster. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The rest is left to luck.</p><p><strong>No one should die for crossing the street.</strong> No one should be crushed for riding a moped. Yet it happens, again and again.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people on foot and bike. Flood the streets with cameras. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Call your council member.

The announcement, made at One Police Plaza, highlighted the bill sponsored by Simon and Sen. John Liu. The matter summary states, 'Officials called on Albany to pass legislation to lower the BAC threshold to .05%, arguing it would reduce DWI fatalities by about 10% and align with other countries.' Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but officials cite 43 NYC DWI deaths in 2021 and say 30% of state crashes involve alcohol.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill targets congestion, collisions, and harm to neighborhoods. It demands hard numbers on vehicle flow, street damage, and danger to people outside cars.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0923-2023 was introduced on February 16, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
