He is 21, a passenger on a moped. The crash comes fast, the end comes faster. In three and a half years, Fresh Meadows-Utopia has seen <strong>1 killed, 4 seriously injured, and 255 hurt</strong> in 426 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Young people pay the price.</strong> In the last year, 13 children were hurt. One teenager, 16, thrown from a moped, left with a head wound. Another, 21, crushed in a five-car pileup. A woman, 48, bleeding from the head after her SUV is struck. These are not rare stories. They are routine.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In this district, sedans and SUVs are the main weapons. Trucks and mopeds follow. Bikes are not in the rollup. The street is a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-what-has-not>What Has Been Done, What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of safety.</strong> The city touts new speed limits, more cameras, and intersection redesigns. But on these streets, the pace of change is slow. The law allows for 20 mph limits, but most streets still run faster. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The rest is left to luck.</p><p><strong>No one should die for crossing the street.</strong> No one should be crushed for riding a moped. Yet it happens, again and again.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people on foot and bike. Flood the streets with cameras. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Call your council member.

The message: don’t drink and drive.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2023, Queens State Senator John Liu, representing District 16, publicly supported a bill in the State Legislature to lower the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for drivers from 0.08 to 0.05. The bill’s summary states, 'The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.' Liu, as the bill’s primary sponsor, emphasized that anyone found with a BAC over 0.05 would be charged with DWI. City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez joined the push, warning, 'Whether they are at 0.06 or 0.12 or 0.20, the consequences can be deadly.' Drunk driving caused 307 deaths in New York State in 2019, nearly a third of all fatal crashes. Utah’s adoption of a 0.05 BAC limit led to a 20% drop in fatal crashes in its first year. The bill is part of a broader effort to protect pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people.

The bill, re-submitted in the last legislative session, remains stuck in committee. At a December 22, 2022 press conference, DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and NYPD’s Kim Royster also spoke, focusing on enforcement and urging drivers to avoid drinking before driving. Advocates like Alisa McMorris of Mothers Against Drunk Driving called for stronger messaging: 'We want people to make choices before they leave their home.' Despite evidence that lowering the threshold could cut traffic deaths by 10%, city messaging still stops short of telling people not to drive to events where they plan to drink.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Announced at a December 22, 2022 press conference, the bill has stalled in committee for years. The matter aims to redefine DWI: 'driving while intoxicated would be defined as anything above a blood-alcohol content of 0.05 percent.' Simon and Liu back the measure; city DOT and NYPD leaders joined them. DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' In 2021, 42 people died in drunk driving crashes, up 60 percent from previous years. Officials promise enforcement and education, but their messaging targets drinking, not the act of driving.
