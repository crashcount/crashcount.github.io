The Car Had the Last Word.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 4, 2025 <em>(Revised June 6, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>East Flatbush-Rugby: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 4, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-toll-in-flesh-and-bone>The Toll in Flesh and Bone</h3><p>A woman steps into the crosswalk. The light says walk. A Mercedes turns left. She does not make it across. Her name was Maurette Lafleur. She was 68. The driver stayed. No charges. The street is quiet again, but the loss is not. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>“The lady spin around and sped through,”</a> said a witness. “I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching.”</p><p>In the last year, <strong>2 people died and 312 were injured</strong> on these streets. Six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. In three years, <strong>over 1,000 people have been hurt</strong> in East Flatbush-Rugby. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the killing.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, vans, trucks—these are the weapons. In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed two, trucks and buses killed one. No bikes, no mopeds, no motorcycles took a life here. The dead and broken are mostly on foot.</p><p>A 14-year-old girl, crossing with the signal, struck by a turning truck. A 75-year-old man, hit by a distracted driver. A principal, drunk, flips his car near a school (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/06/gregory-jackson-dwi-arrest-flipped-over-brownsville-collaborative-middle-school/>principal flips his car</a>). The pattern is simple. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They build some new crosswalks. They add a few bike lanes. They say, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.” But the speed limit is still too high. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark. The law to force repeat dangerous drivers into safety courses has lapsed.</p><p>A witness said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>“The government should do something, like when people are walking, no cars should be moving.”</a> The government has not done enough.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never shut off. Demand streets where walking is not a gamble. Every day of delay is another family broken. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
