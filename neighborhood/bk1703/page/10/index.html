The records say the car was a sedan, “going straight,” and the cause included “Unsafe Speed.” The pedestrian was “Crossing Against Signal.” He died at the scene.

The vehicle was a Ford SUV. The sheet lists “Alcohol Involvement.” It also lists “Crossing Against Signal.” One person is gone. The SUV drove away on four tires (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4828979</a>).</p><p>In November 2022, an older woman was struck on Church Avenue while “Getting On/Off Vehicle Other Than School Bus.” The driver was unlicensed.

Linden Boulevard shows 72 injuries and three serious injuries. These are the top local hot spots (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>). On Aug. 14, 2025, a 61‑year‑old woman was struck at Utica and Lenox. The sedan hit her while “Going Straight Ahead.” The report says “Severe Bleeding,” “Semiconscious.” No more words for that (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4835070</a>).</p><p>A day later, near Albany Ave, another pedestrian was listed as “Unconscious,” legs crushed, after a crash involving an Infiniti sedan and a parked Chevy SUV (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4837211</a>).</p><h3 id=night-falls-the-numbers-rise>Night falls, the numbers rise</h3><p>Across East Flatbush‑Rugby, the worst hour is 7 p.m. Nineteen hundred hours.

Louis co‑sponsors it (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>). Another, co‑sponsored by Louis, pushes a crackdown on unlicensed commuter vans, ordering maximum penalties when stopped (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347‑2025</a>).</p><p>In Albany, Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee on a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat violators. The bill targets drivers with stacks of points or camera tickets. Committee votes advanced it on June 11 and 12, 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>).</p><p>Lower speeds citywide. Stop repeat speeders.
