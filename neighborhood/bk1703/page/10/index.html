Each stop now gets logged with the reason, time, and outcome. No names. Just facts. The city posts these reports online. A move for sunlight. No more secrets.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0781-2022, now law, came through the Committee on Public Safety. The Council passed it on January 20, 2024. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the police department to report on the justification for the stop in vehicle encounter reports," demands the NYPD document every vehicle stop. Reports must include the reason for the stop, the level of offense, and demographic details, but no personal identifiers. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and others led the charge. The law aims to expose patterns in police stops and holds officers to account. Reports go online, open to all. This is a step toward transparency, not just for drivers, but for every New Yorker who walks, rides, or waits at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
