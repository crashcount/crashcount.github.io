The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the killing.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, vans, trucks—these are the weapons. In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed two, trucks and buses killed one. No bikes, no mopeds, no motorcycles took a life here. The dead and broken are mostly on foot.</p><p>A 14-year-old girl, crossing with the signal, struck by a turning truck. A 75-year-old man, hit by a distracted driver. A principal, drunk, flips his car near a school (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/06/gregory-jackson-dwi-arrest-flipped-over-brownsville-collaborative-middle-school/>principal flips his car</a>). The pattern is simple. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They build some new crosswalks. They add a few bike lanes. They say, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.” But the speed limit is still too high. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark. The law to force repeat dangerous drivers into safety courses has lapsed.</p><p>A witness said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>“The government should do something, like when people are walking, no cars should be moving.”</a> The government has not done enough.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never shut off. Demand streets where walking is not a gamble. Every day of delay is another family broken. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Bike lanes now follow the same rules as other major projects. The city can act faster after feedback. The old bike lane notice law is gone.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0417-2022, now enacted, amends the city code to create a single, uniform process for notifying council members and community boards about major transportation projects—including bike lanes. The bill, handled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on May 19, 2022, and passed on January 6, 2024. The official title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to notice requirements for certain transportation projects and the repeal of section 19-187 in relation thereto.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of colleagues. The law repeals the old, separate bike lane notice process and folds it into the broader project notice rules. Now, after a set notice period and community feedback, the Department of Transportation can move ahead without delay. This change aims to cut red tape and speed up street redesigns that affect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure urges the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.1679/S.561, which would 'increase the penalty for leaving the scene of an accident involving an e-scooter and further calls upon the New York State Legislature to include e-bikes in such legislation.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Gale A. Brewer, Shaun Abreu, Lynn C. Schulman, and Amanda Farías backed the resolution. The bill would raise penalties for e-scooter hit-and-runs from a violation to a misdemeanor or felony, and seeks to add e-bikes to the law. The council argues this could keep more crash-involved riders at the scene, helping protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
