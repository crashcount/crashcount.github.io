The records say the car was a sedan, “going straight,” and the cause included “Unsafe Speed.” The pedestrian was “Crossing Against Signal.” He died at the scene.

The vehicle was a Ford SUV. The sheet lists “Alcohol Involvement.” It also lists “Crossing Against Signal.” One person is gone. The SUV drove away on four tires (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4828979</a>).</p><p>In November 2022, an older woman was struck on Church Avenue while “Getting On/Off Vehicle Other Than School Bus.” The driver was unlicensed. She died.

These are the top local hot spots (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>). On Aug. 14, 2025, a 61‑year‑old woman was struck at Utica and Lenox. The sedan hit her while “Going Straight Ahead.” The report says “Severe Bleeding,” “Semiconscious.” No more words for that (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4835070</a>).</p><p>A day later, near Albany Ave, another pedestrian was listed as “Unconscious,” legs crushed, after a crash involving an Infiniti sedan and a parked Chevy SUV (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4837211</a>).</p><h3 id=night-falls-the-numbers-rise>Night falls, the numbers rise</h3><p>Across East Flatbush‑Rugby, the worst hour is 7 p.m. Nineteen hundred hours.

Louis co‑sponsors it (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>). Another, co‑sponsored by Louis, pushes a crackdown on unlicensed commuter vans, ordering maximum penalties when stopped (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347‑2025</a>).</p><p>In Albany, Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee on a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat violators. The bill targets drivers with stacks of points or camera tickets. Committee votes advanced it on June 11 and 12, 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>).</p><p>Lower speeds citywide. Stop repeat speeders.

Fresh pavement replaces potholes. Cyclists and pedestrians gain wider, dedicated lanes. Cars lose ground. Officials call it a pilot for city parks. If it works, Central Park could be next.</p><p class=mb3>On March 8, 2023, city officials announced a major redesign of Prospect Park’s East Drive. The project, not tied to a specific council bill, begins March 12 and is billed as an 18-month pilot. The main loop’s eastern stretch will be repaved and repainted, giving cyclists a 16-to-18-foot shared lane with authorized vehicles, flanked by two pedestrian lanes up to 14 feet wide. The city rejected a two-bike-lane alternative, citing pedestrian access needs. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie praised the upgrade, calling Prospect Park a treasure. Chief Public Realm Officer Ya-Ting Liu said, 'Re-examining how we design the roads in our park system is a perfect example of how we’re advancing the Mayor’s vision for quality public spaces throughout the city.' Officials stress the park is closed to private vehicles. The redesign aims to set a new standard for park safety and access across New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
