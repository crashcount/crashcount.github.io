The hearing followed a Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) investigation, which found Kovalik abused his authority by threatening Myrie and others with pepper spray during a protest on May 29, 2020. The matter centered on 'excessive use of force with department-issued bikes' and the officer's actions at a protest outside Barclays Center after George Floyd's murder. Myrie, detained with zip ties, said, 'I felt what felt like bike tires on my back and on my arms.' He described lasting trauma from the incident. The CCRB prosecutor, Andre Applewhite, argued video evidence confirmed the threats. Myrie and another lawmaker have filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD. The case highlights the dangers faced by peaceful protesters and the use of police bicycles as tools of force.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Industry fights back in court.</p><p class=mb3>On June 14, 2022, State Sen. Zellnor Myrie sponsored a New York law enabling lawsuits against gun manufacturers for dangerous marketing or sales practices. The law, recently upheld in court, lets victims like Ilene Steur—injured in the Sunset Park subway shooting—sue Glock. The bill challenges federal PLCAA protections that shield gun companies. Myrie says, 'Bad actions by industries...are often forced to change their practices by way of litigation.' He insists, 'This isn’t about anyone coming after your legally possessed guns...The guns are killing my people.' The law is not about targeting legal gun owners, but about holding companies accountable when their products fuel violence. Gun industry groups are fighting the law, but for now, it stands. Myrie’s push is clear: force the industry to act or get out of New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The editorial, titled 'Free perking: Pull back run amok NYC parking placards,' calls out rampant placard abuse: 'End this scam.' Restler’s companion bill would reward whistleblowers who report cheaters with 25% of fines collected. Both measures have four co-sponsors. The editorial urges the Council to pass the bills and for Mayor Adams to sign them. Placard abuse fuels lawless parking, endangering pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s lack of oversight lets drivers block crosswalks and bike lanes.

He says outsiders patrol like an occupying force. Research shows residency means faster response, better trust, and fewer abuses. Mayor Adams backs the idea.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill S2984, introduced by State Senator Kevin Parker, would reinstate a residency requirement for all future NYPD officers. The bill is currently a legislative proposal. Parker argues, 'we need an NYPD residency requirement, which the force had until 1962.' He highlights that over half of NYPD officers now live outside the city, undermining trust and accountability. Parker’s record includes laws on police misconduct, body cameras, and transparency. He cites a 2021 DePaul University study showing residency brings faster response times, better complaint handling, more diversity, and stronger community ties. Mayor Adams called the proposal 'a smart idea.' Parker urges Albany to act, stressing that most city civil servants already live in the five boroughs. He pledges to work on affordable housing for officers. The bill stands as one tool among many in Parker’s police reform agenda.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to amend the city’s administrative code to increase penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles, including those under and over 10,000 pounds, and for unauthorized horns and claxons. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing certain penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles.' Council Member Sandra Ung sponsored the bill, joined by 26 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. There is no evidence the bill would have improved safety for vulnerable road users. The city’s noise problem, and its threat to livable streets, remains unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to amend the city code to 'establish a reward for individuals who provide information leading to the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person who seriously injures or kills another individual in a hit-and-run accident.' Council Member Rita C. Joseph sponsored the bill, joined by sixteen co-sponsors including Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, and others. The bill would have authorized up to $1,000 for information leading to the capture of hit-and-run drivers, but excluded law enforcement and city employees from eligibility. The measure was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. With the bill's failure, the city offers no extra incentive to help catch drivers who leave victims bleeding in the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
