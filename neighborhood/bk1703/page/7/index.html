The records say the car was a sedan, “going straight,” and the cause included “Unsafe Speed.” The pedestrian was “Crossing Against Signal.” He died at the scene.

The vehicle was a Ford SUV. The sheet lists “Alcohol Involvement.” It also lists “Crossing Against Signal.” One person is gone. The SUV drove away on four tires (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4828979</a>).</p><p>In November 2022, an older woman was struck on Church Avenue while “Getting On/Off Vehicle Other Than School Bus.” The driver was unlicensed. She died.

Linden Boulevard shows 72 injuries and three serious injuries. These are the top local hot spots (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>). On Aug. 14, 2025, a 61‑year‑old woman was struck at Utica and Lenox. The sedan hit her while “Going Straight Ahead.” The report says “Severe Bleeding,” “Semiconscious.” No more words for that (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4835070</a>).</p><p>A day later, near Albany Ave, another pedestrian was listed as “Unconscious,” legs crushed, after a crash involving an Infiniti sedan and a parked Chevy SUV (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4837211</a>).</p><h3 id=night-falls-the-numbers-rise>Night falls, the numbers rise</h3><p>Across East Flatbush‑Rugby, the worst hour is 7 p.m. Nineteen hundred hours.

Louis co‑sponsors it (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>). Another, co‑sponsored by Louis, pushes a crackdown on unlicensed commuter vans, ordering maximum penalties when stopped (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347‑2025</a>).</p><p>In Albany, Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee on a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat violators. The bill targets drivers with stacks of points or camera tickets. Committee votes advanced it on June 11 and 12, 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>).</p><p>Lower speeds citywide. Stop repeat speeders. These two moves cut deep and fast. The city already has the tools. Use them. Call it what it is: a choice.

Voters want action.</p><p class=mb3>On April 15, 2025, a Siena College poll revealed that 77% of New York City voters rank pedestrian safety as a top concern. The poll, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found deep worry among women, seniors, and Bronx residents. The matter summary reads: '77% of NYC voters consider pedestrian safety a serious issue.' Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death. The poll signals a mandate: fix the streets, protect the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police and prosecutors state she struck and killed a mother and her two young children. The article quotes, "Yarimi was speeding in her Audi when she ran a red light and struck the family." Yarimi told first responders she was 'possessed' at the time. The report highlights her suspended license and excessive speed, both clear driver errors. The case underscores ongoing risks for pedestrians and families on city streets, and raises questions about license enforcement and traffic safety in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law would force repeat reckless drivers to use speed-limiting tech. Survivors demand action. Lawmakers promise change.</p><p class=mb3>On April 1, 2025, Council Member Shahana Hanif joined a rally at Brooklyn Borough Hall demanding passage of the Stop Super Speeders bill. The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws. Some opposition remains, but supporters say the measure is urgent and practical.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
