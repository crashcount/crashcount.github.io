The records say the car was a sedan, “going straight,” and the cause included “Unsafe Speed.” The pedestrian was “Crossing Against Signal.” He died at the scene. That’s all the city will allow you to know (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash 4788144</a>).</p><p>On July 17, 2025, at Church Avenue and E 55th St, a 36‑year‑old man was killed. The vehicle was a Ford SUV. The sheet lists “Alcohol Involvement.” It also lists “Crossing Against Signal.” One person is gone. The SUV drove away on four tires (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4828979</a>).</p><p>In November 2022, an older woman was struck on Church Avenue while “Getting On/Off Vehicle Other Than School Bus.” The driver was unlicensed. She died. The van’s front end tells the rest (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4579422</a>).</p><h3 id=utica-and-linden-injuries-pile-up>Utica and Linden: injuries pile up</h3><p>Utica Avenue racks up injuries — 71 people hurt since 2022, with three serious injuries logged. Linden Boulevard shows 72 injuries and three serious injuries. These are the top local hot spots (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>). On Aug. 14, 2025, a 61‑year‑old woman was struck at Utica and Lenox. The sedan hit her while “Going Straight Ahead.” The report says “Severe Bleeding,” “Semiconscious.” No more words for that (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4835070</a>).</p><p>A day later, near Albany Ave, another pedestrian was listed as “Unconscious,” legs crushed, after a crash involving an Infiniti sedan and a parked Chevy SUV (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4837211</a>).</p><h3 id=night-falls-the-numbers-rise>Night falls, the numbers rise</h3><p>Across East Flatbush‑Rugby, the worst hour is 7 p.m. Nineteen hundred hours. Three deaths and 67 injuries stack there. Late night hurts too: 9 p.m. shows four serious injuries; 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. add more hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>Pedestrians bear it. Since 2022, four pedestrians are dead, 176 injured. Cars and SUVs are the main striking vehicles, listed in the city roll‑up.

One would force DOT to install school‑adjacent traffic devices within 60 days of a study finding the need. Farah N. Louis co‑sponsors it (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>). Another, co‑sponsored by Louis, pushes a crackdown on unlicensed commuter vans, ordering maximum penalties when stopped (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347‑2025</a>).</p><p>In Albany, Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee on a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat violators. The bill targets drivers with stacks of points or camera tickets. Committee votes advanced it on June 11 and 12, 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>).</p><p>Lower speeds citywide. Stop repeat speeders. These two moves cut deep and fast. The city already has the tools. Use them. Call it what it is: a choice.
