The Car Had the Last Word.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 4, 2025 <em>(Revised June 26, 2025 – Updated period stats)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>East Flatbush-Rugby: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 27, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-toll-in-flesh-and-bone>The Toll in Flesh and Bone</h3><p>A woman steps into the crosswalk. The light says walk. A Mercedes turns left. She does not make it across. Her name was Maurette Lafleur. She was 68. The driver stayed. No charges. The street is quiet again, but the loss is not. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>“The lady spin around and sped through,”</a> said a witness. “I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching.”</p><p>In the last year, <strong>2 people died and 312 were injured</strong> on these streets. Six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. In three years, <strong>over 1,000 people have been hurt</strong> in East Flatbush-Rugby. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the killing.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, vans, trucks—these are the weapons. In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed two, trucks and buses killed one. No bikes, no mopeds, no motorcycles took a life here. The dead and broken are mostly on foot.</p><p>A 14-year-old girl, crossing with the signal, struck by a turning truck. A 75-year-old man, hit by a distracted driver. A principal, drunk, flips his car near a school (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/06/gregory-jackson-dwi-arrest-flipped-over-brownsville-collaborative-middle-school/>principal flips his car</a>). The pattern is simple. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They build some new crosswalks. They add a few bike lanes. They say, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.” But the speed limit is still too high. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark. The law to force repeat dangerous drivers into safety courses has lapsed.</p><p>A witness said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>“The government should do something, like when people are walking, no cars should be moving.”</a> The government has not done enough.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never shut off. Demand streets where walking is not a gamble. Every day of delay is another family broken. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On April 28, 2025, the committee laid the bill over.

The poll, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found deep worry among women, seniors, and Bronx residents. The matter summary reads: '77% of NYC voters consider pedestrian safety a serious issue.' Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death.

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws. Some opposition remains, but supporters say the measure is urgent and practical.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
