The law is set to expire. <strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city built more crosswalks, added bike lanes, and made some intersections safer.

Not after another child is hit.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

Residents fear traffic will flood side streets. Bus riders crawl at five miles an hour. Officials tout safety gains from 14th Street. Tension rises between speed, safety, and neighborhood calm.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (2025-06-08) reports that the city proposes restricting cars on 34th Street to create a busway between 3rd and 9th Avenues. Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.
