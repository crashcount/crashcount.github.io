Another, age 62, struck by an SUV at 3rd Avenue and 122nd. A 66-year-old, dead on 5th Avenue.

The law is set to expire. <strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city built more crosswalks, added bike lanes, and made some intersections safer. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>No law, no design, no camera brings back the dead.</strong> The only thing that matters is action now. Not next year. Not after another child is hit.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.</strong> Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
