The crash left vehicles dented and battered, the air thick with the sound of emergency crews and shaken voices.</p><p class=mb3>On Van Siclen Avenue near Stanley Avenue in Brooklyn, a collision involving multiple vehicles—including a pick-up truck and several sedans—left three people injured. According to the police report, a 55-year-old male driver and two female passengers, ages 23 and 24, sustained neck injuries and bruises. The report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for all injured parties, providing no details on specific driver errors or violations. Vehicle records show actions such as making a right turn, making a U-turn, and going straight ahead immediately before the crash. No helmet or signal use is mentioned as a contributing factor. The incident underscores the risks faced by vehicle occupants in complex, multi-car collisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

One driver collected 563 speed-camera tickets in Sheepshead Bay; another, 474 in Manhattan. The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low. The report highlights a small group’s outsized threat and the policy gap that lets them keep driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
