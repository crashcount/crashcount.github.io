The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code...requiring micromobility share system operators to display rules of the road for safe operation," demands operators post rules at stations and in apps. Riders must review these rules at least once a year before unlocking a device. The law bars operators from charging for the review time. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hanif, Brewer, Restler, Louis, Narcisse, Lee, Marte, Hanks, Banks, Gutiérrez, Ariola, and Morano. The measure aims for clear, accessible safety information but does not address street design or enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill advanced through committee and received broad support in both chambers. By exempting these large complexes, the law weakens traffic enforcement where thousands live.
