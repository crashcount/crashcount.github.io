An SUV crushes her. A man waits for a tow truck. He is shot in both legs after a crash. A cyclist is thrown from his bike, dead before he hits the ground. These are not stories from far away. They are the daily cost of moving through East New York-New Lots.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 1 person died and 488 were injured in 688 crashes here.</strong> Two people suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons. A 58-year-old woman, struck down by a Toyota SUV on Pennsylvania Avenue. A 43-year-old man, killed on his bike by a turning truck at Linden and Pennsylvania.

On a cold night in January, a man was left bleeding on Pennsylvania Avenue after an argument turned to gunfire. Police are seeking the public&rsquo;s assistance in locating a gunman who shot a 34-year-old man in the legs after an argument on a Brooklyn street following a car accident, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/01/nypd-hunts-gunman-who-repeatedly-shot-stranger-in-legs-in-brooklyn-after-car-accident/>reported the NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>When a Jeep crashed through a fence and landed on the L train tracks, a witness said, &ldquo;Next thing I know, he was into the fence.

Each delay is another body in the road.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can harden crosswalks and protect bike lanes. It can fight for more cameras and stricter enforcement. But it will not move unless you make it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member.
