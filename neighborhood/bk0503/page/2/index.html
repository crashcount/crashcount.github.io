Martins and co-sponsored by nine other senators. The bill sought to repeal congestion pricing and direct the MTA to conduct a forensic audit. The committee vote failed to pass the bill. Martins and his co-sponsors acted to end a program designed to cut car traffic and fund transit. No safety analyst note was provided, but repealing congestion pricing would have removed protections for pedestrians and cyclists who face daily danger from unchecked car volume.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
