On a cold night in January, a man was left bleeding on Pennsylvania Avenue after an argument turned to gunfire. Police are seeking the public&rsquo;s assistance in locating a gunman who shot a 34-year-old man in the legs after an argument on a Brooklyn street following a car accident, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/01/nypd-hunts-gunman-who-repeatedly-shot-stranger-in-legs-in-brooklyn-after-car-accident/>reported the NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>When a Jeep crashed through a fence and landed on the L train tracks, a witness said, &ldquo;Next thing I know, he was into the fence. Absolutely crazy.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/driver-fleeing-cops-brooklyn-subway-station/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>. The driver walked away. The neighborhood waited for the trains to run again.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They have the power to lower speed limits, redesign deadly intersections, and keep speed cameras running.</strong> But the pace is slow. Each delay is another body in the road.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can harden crosswalks and protect bike lanes. It can fight for more cameras and stricter enforcement. But it will not move unless you make it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another neighbor to die. The blood on the street is not an accident.
