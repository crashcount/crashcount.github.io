Blood on the curb. In the last twelve months, two people died and nine were seriously injured on the streets of Harlem (North). Another 261 were hurt. The dead include a three-year-old girl, struck by an SUV while crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. Her mother survived, injured and alone. The SUV was making a left turn. The girl was crossing with the light. The driver kept his license. The girl lost her life. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 59-year-old man on a bike was killed by a bus at Lenox and 138th.

He voted yes to let pedestrians cross where they need to, ending the city’s war on so-called jaywalkers. The law’s aim: streets for people, not just cars. The law <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights</a>.</p><p>Salaam also co-sponsored a bill to force the city to build 100 miles of protected bike lanes each year. The bill’s summary is plain: protected lanes <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>increase cycling and ensure the safety of New Yorkers</a>.</p><p>But the danger does not wait for new paint. SUVs and cars still do the most harm. In this region, they killed one, seriously injured four, and hurt 166 more. Trucks and buses killed one and injured 18. Bikes and mopeds injured eight and five, but killed no one. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-disaster-is-slow-but-it-is-not-fate>The Disaster Is Slow, But It Is Not Fate</h3><p>Every crash is a choice made upstream.
