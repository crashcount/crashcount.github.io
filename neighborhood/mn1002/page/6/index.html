She is three. An SUV turns left. She does not make it to the other side. Her mother is struck too, left bleeding in the street. Both were crossing with the signal. The driver kept going, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A man rides his bike on Lenox at 138th. A city bus and an e-bike move straight ahead. The cyclist is crushed. He does not get up. The street is quiet again, but the blood does not wash away.</p><p>In the last twelve months, two people died and seven suffered serious injuries on these streets. 281 were hurt. The dead include a child and a cyclist. The injured are old, young, and in between. The numbers do not stop. 521 crashes in a year. Every four days, someone is hurt badly enough to change their life.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>Devon Hughley was a local. He loved bicycles and dogs. He was known in the neighborhood. He was killed by a driver fleeing police in a stolen van. The posters with his face are still taped to the wall. His sister <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/06/harlem-hit-and-run-nypd-car-stop-stolen-van-bicyclist-devon-hughley-arrest-enesin-delarosa/>said the arrest brought some peace</a>. But peace does not bring him back.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting-game>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting Game</h3><p>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They point to new laws. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered yet. The city has the power. It does not use it. Speed cameras work, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another risk, another family waiting for news that will break them.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit now. Tell Albany to keep the cameras on. Demand streets where a child can cross and come home. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action today.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The pilot aims to fight the city’s heat island effect. The bill sits in committee. No direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety. Streets stay hot. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0928-2024, introduced May 23, 2024, sits 'Laid Over in Committee' at the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill orders the Department of Transportation, with Health and Mental Hygiene, to run a pilot project testing cool pavement—materials that lower street temperatures—across at least four neighborhoods facing heat and disadvantage. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law in relation to requiring the department of transportation to conduct a pilot project on the use of cool pavement.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by 29 co-sponsors. The bill requires DOT to report findings to the Mayor and Council. Safety analysts note no direct effect on vulnerable road users: the measure targets heat, not traffic violence. The city’s most dangerous streets remain unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
