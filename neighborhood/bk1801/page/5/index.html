Twenty-six left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In Flatlands, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers do not lie. <strong>1,281 people injured</strong> in 1,884 crashes. The dead: a 17-year-old boy, a 24-year-old woman, a 31-year-old man. Each struck down while walking. Each killed by a car or SUV. Each name lost to the street, each family left with silence.</p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In the last year alone, 37 people under 18 were hurt. Two were left with injuries so severe they may never recover. The old are not spared. The strong are not spared. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed all three pedestrians. They left dozens more with broken bones and worse. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Sedans and SUVs</a> are the constant. Trucks, motorcycles, bikes—they injure, but the deadliest wounds come from the biggest machines.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-enough>Leadership: Words, Not Enough</h3><p>The city says it is acting. <strong>Speed cameras now run all day and night.</strong> The law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Flatlands, the blood keeps flowing. <strong>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</strong> No council member has called for a citywide 20 mph limit here. No one has demanded more cameras, more redesigns, more protection for the old, the young, the walker, the rider.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every delay is a death sentence for someone you know. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another child to die.

The bill adds pets to protected victims in traffic law. It hikes fines for drivers who hit animals and flee. Lawmakers push for real consequences when cars strike dogs, cats, and other companions.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0723-2025 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage. Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes.
