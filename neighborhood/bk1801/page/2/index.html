Same ending.</p><ul><li>On August 18, a 28-year-old woman was hit at the Flatlands Avenue intersection near 3831. The Honda was turning left. NYPD coded “Failure to Yield.” She bled from the head and lived. The system calls this an injury, level 4. It is a warning that keeps coming back (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash 4836117</a>).</li><li>A 17-year-old died on Kings Highway. Unsafe speed. A pass gone wrong. The boy was a pedestrian. A 19-year-old BMW driver was hurt too. Only one did not get up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4502351</a>).</li><li>A 31-year-old man died at Utica and Avenue N. He was on foot. The driver was unlicensed. He did not stop with time that mattered (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4504756</a>).</li><li>A 24-year-old woman died on Flatlands Avenue. Head trauma. A Ford sedan. Another straight-ahead strike. Another family changed in a minute (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4539504</a>).</li></ul><p>Pedestrians take the hit here: three dead, 216 injured since 2022 in this neighborhood. Occupants pile up the numbers, but people on foot pay with their lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>local rollup</a>). The worst hours build from late afternoon into night: injuries crest at 2 p.m., 4 p.m., and again 9–10 p.m. Deaths spike at 7–9 p.m. Two at 9 p.m., one at 8 p.m. The rhythm is cruel (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>“Failure to Yield.” “Unsafe Speed.” “Disregarded Traffic Control.” The city calls them contributing factors.

One fix.</p><ul><li>Utica Avenue leads the injury list and holds a death. Avenue J, Avenue K, Ralph Avenue follow with dozens hurt. Flatbush Avenue is there too. These are not secrets. They are addresses (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>).</li><li>Left turns cut people down. Harden the turns.

The bill is in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1353-2025</a>).</p><p>The Council also moved on unlicensed commuter vans. Farah N. Louis and Mercedes Narcisse co‑sponsor a crackdown mandating maximum penalties across a checklist when stopped. It sits in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1347-2025</a>).</p><p>At the state level, Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee for a bill to force intelligent speed assistance on repeat violators. It targets drivers with a pattern of speeding and points. He voted yes on June 11 and 12, 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>).</p><p>What drivers do here.</p><ul><li>In this neighborhood period, cars and SUVs strike most pedestrians. Sedans alone account for two of the pedestrian deaths and 83 pedestrian casualties; SUVs add another death and 91 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>local vehicle rollup</a>).</li><li>The tally since 2022: four total deaths, 1,440 injured, 31 seriously. The people most hurt are 25–34 and 35–44, but the dead include the young and the old (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>local stats</a>).</li></ul><p>A policy window, if someone opens it.</p><ul><li>Albany already gave the city the tool to drop speeds.

Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lane, shielded by parked cars, now waits for a court fight. Cyclists and advocates hold their ground.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on July 15, 2025, that an appellate judge blocked New York City from removing the protected Bedford Ave bike lane in Williamsburg. The city planned to move cyclists next to car traffic, but the court granted an emergency restraining order after advocates appealed. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the lane a 'critical safety project.' City Hall insists the reconfiguration is legal and claims the appeal delays 'easing the safety concerns plaguing Williamsburg parents.' The protected lane, installed in October 2024, separates cyclists from moving vehicles.
