Twenty-six left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In Flatlands, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers do not lie. <strong>1,281 people injured</strong> in 1,884 crashes. The dead: a 17-year-old boy, a 24-year-old woman, a 31-year-old man. Each struck down while walking. Each killed by a car or SUV. Each name lost to the street, each family left with silence.</p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In the last year alone, 37 people under 18 were hurt. Two were left with injuries so severe they may never recover. The old are not spared. The strong are not spared. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed all three pedestrians. They left dozens more with broken bones and worse. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Sedans and SUVs</a> are the constant. Trucks, motorcycles, bikes—they injure, but the deadliest wounds come from the biggest machines.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-enough>Leadership: Words, Not Enough</h3><p>The city says it is acting. <strong>Speed cameras now run all day and night.</strong> The law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Flatlands, the blood keeps flowing. <strong>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</strong> No council member has called for a citywide 20 mph limit here. No one has demanded more cameras, more redesigns, more protection for the old, the young, the walker, the rider.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every delay is a death sentence for someone you know. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another child to die.

The bill demands quick action, deep analysis, and public reporting. It targets street design flaws and driver behavior. Lawmakers filed it, but the session ended before passage.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0858-2022, introduced December 21, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, aimed to overhaul how New York City investigates vehicle collisions. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Farah N. Louis (primary) and co-sponsored by Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Shekar Krishnan, Charles Barron, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Lincoln Restler, and Rita C. Joseph, required the Department of Transportation to investigate all serious vehicular crashes. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to investigate vehicle collisions.' The bill would have expanded the definition of serious crashes, set strict investigation timelines, and mandated detailed public reports. It also called for reviews of street design and infrastructure at crash sites, with recommendations for safety improvements. The bill was filed at the end of the session and did not become law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
