Twenty-six left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In Flatlands, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers do not lie. <strong>1,281 people injured</strong> in 1,884 crashes. The dead: a 17-year-old boy, a 24-year-old woman, a 31-year-old man. Each struck down while walking. Each killed by a car or SUV. Each name lost to the street, each family left with silence.</p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In the last year alone, 37 people under 18 were hurt. Two were left with injuries so severe they may never recover. The old are not spared. The strong are not spared. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed all three pedestrians. They left dozens more with broken bones and worse. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Sedans and SUVs</a> are the constant.

But in Flatlands, the blood keeps flowing. <strong>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</strong> No council member has called for a citywide 20 mph limit here. No one has demanded more cameras, more redesigns, more protection for the old, the young, the walker, the rider.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every delay is a death sentence for someone you know. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another child to die.

The measure, championed by Councilwoman Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, cleared the chamber in a veto-proof 40-8 vote. The bill's matter title: 'Jaywalking in NYC is set to be legal.' The legislation eliminates the $250 fine for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione testified against the bill, warning, 'Over the last five years, 200 people lost their lives while crossing the street mid-block or against the signal, making up about 34 percent of all pedestrian fatalities.' Mayor Eric Adams neither signed nor vetoed the bill, allowing it to become law. City Hall and NYPD officials continue to urge pedestrians to follow traffic rules.
