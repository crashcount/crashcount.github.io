Twenty-six left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In Flatlands, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers do not lie. <strong>1,281 people injured</strong> in 1,884 crashes. The dead: a 17-year-old boy, a 24-year-old woman, a 31-year-old man. Each struck down while walking. Each killed by a car or SUV. Each name lost to the street, each family left with silence.</p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In the last year alone, 37 people under 18 were hurt. Two were left with injuries so severe they may never recover. The old are not spared. The strong are not spared. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed all three pedestrians. They left dozens more with broken bones and worse. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Sedans and SUVs</a> are the constant. Trucks, motorcycles, bikes—they injure, but the deadliest wounds come from the biggest machines.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-enough>Leadership: Words, Not Enough</h3><p>The city says it is acting. <strong>Speed cameras now run all day and night.</strong> The law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Flatlands, the blood keeps flowing. <strong>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</strong> No council member has called for a citywide 20 mph limit here. No one has demanded more cameras, more redesigns, more protection for the old, the young, the walker, the rider.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every delay is a death sentence for someone you know. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another child to die.

Three bills were considered: a daylighting bill by Councilmember Julie Won to ban parking near crosswalks and require 1,000 daylighting barriers per year; a bill by Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse to waive extra fees for late parking ticket responses; and a bill by Councilmember Natasha Williams to create overnight truck parking in industrial zones. The matter summary reads: 'NYC Council to examine truck parking, daylighting and fine relief in hearing on city parking woes.' Narcisse’s bill targets fee relief for drivers who respond to violations between 45 and 90 days. Won’s daylighting bill drew support from 120 organizations. DOT faced questions on loading zones, permit abuse, and intersection safety. The hearing spotlighted the city’s struggle to balance safety for pedestrians and cyclists with business and driver concerns. No final votes yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the boy was left unconscious on the pavement with severe head lacerations after the impact, which occurred at the vehicle’s left front bumper. The driver was operating a 2013 Ford SUV and remained at the scene. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. The report also notes the pedestrian was 'Riding/Walking Along Highway Against Traffic' and lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor. The primary focus remains on the driver’s inattention, which led to the violent collision and left a teenager gravely injured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
