Twenty-five left with serious wounds.</strong> In just three and a half years, the streets of Flushing-Willets Point have become a gauntlet for the old, the young, and everyone in between. A 78-year-old woman tried to cross Northern Boulevard. She never made it. The driver fled. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>“A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.”</a> Her name did not make the news. The car did not stop. The street stayed open.</p><p>A few blocks away, a man and a child were hit. The man was pinned under the car. The child, just eight or ten, was sent to the hospital. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>Police responded and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.</a> The driver stayed. The street stayed the same.</p><h2 id=numbers-that-dont-lie>Numbers That Don’t Lie</h2><p><strong>Over 1,000 people injured.</strong> More than 1,800 crashes. The dead are not numbers, but the numbers do not lie. In the last year alone, three people died and a dozen were left with life-changing injuries. The old, the very young, the ones just trying to cross the street. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing. Trucks and bikes took their share. No one is safe. No one is spared.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting the city lower speed limits. But the limit on most streets is still 25. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. The city says, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> But the streets do not change. The deaths do not stop.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

One driver, a 59-year-old woman, was injured with head trauma and whiplash but remained conscious and was not ejected. The report lists 'Driver Inexperience' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors. The female driver was going straight ahead when the male driver, merging, struck her vehicle's left front quarter panel with his right front bumper. The female driver’s injuries and the vehicle damage patterns confirm the collision dynamics. The male driver’s inexperience and failure to yield right-of-way directly contributed to the crash, highlighting systemic danger in merging maneuvers on busy Queens streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
