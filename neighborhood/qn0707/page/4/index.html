No justice. Just another name lost to the street.</p><p>Two days earlier, a man and a child were hit at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man was pinned under the car. The child, between eight and ten, was also hurt. Police found them both on the pavement. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>&ldquo;Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.&rdquo;</a> The driver stayed. The pain did not.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit on these streets is still higher. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. The city has built more crosswalks and bike lanes, but the blood keeps flowing. The council and mayor have the power to slow the cars. They have not used it.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets where a child can cross and live. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law in relation to requiring a study and plan regarding the installation of tactile paving on sidewalks,' mandates a one-year study and a five-year plan for tactile paving across New York City. Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Chris Banks, and Sandra Ung back the measure. The Department of Transportation must identify high-priority blocks, consult disability advocates, and review best practices. The Commissioner must submit a plan and annual progress reports to the Mayor and Council Speaker, all posted online.

The white Toyota sedan hit an underpass near 225th Street around 3:50 a.m. Both occupants were found outside the wreck when police arrived.

The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive.

At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff. This is basic transit maintenance.” Liu said losing congestion pricing would erase a billion dollars in annual MTA revenue, threatening $15 billion in planned upgrades. The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily. Both officials opposed the repeal, highlighting the risk to the city’s transit backbone. The bill is not numbered, but the threat is clear: without congestion pricing, the city’s streets and subways grow more dangerous for everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
