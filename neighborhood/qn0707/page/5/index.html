Twenty-seven left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past twelve months, 565 crashes tore through Flushing-Willets Point. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared.

No justice. Just another name lost to the street.</p><p>Two days earlier, a man and a child were hit at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man was pinned under the car. The child, between eight and ten, was also hurt. Police found them both on the pavement. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>&ldquo;Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.&rdquo;</a> The driver stayed.

The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit on these streets is still higher. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. The city has built more crosswalks and bike lanes, but the blood keeps flowing. The council and mayor have the power to slow the cars. They have not used it.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Two sedans traveling south collided when the trailing vehicle failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in a rear-end impact on the lead vehicle’s left rear bumper. The driver of the lead sedan, a 37-year-old woman, sustained neck injuries and was reported in shock. She was wearing a lap belt at the time of the crash and was not ejected from the vehicle. The report cites "Following Too Closely" as the primary contributing factor, highlighting driver error in maintaining proper spacing. Both drivers held valid New York licenses, and the trailing vehicle was slowing or stopping before impact.
