No justice. Just another name lost to the street.</p><p>Two days earlier, a man and a child were hit at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man was pinned under the car. The child, between eight and ten, was also hurt. Police found them both on the pavement. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>&ldquo;Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.&rdquo;</a> The driver stayed. The pain did not.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit on these streets is still higher. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. The city has built more crosswalks and bike lanes, but the blood keeps flowing. The council and mayor have the power to slow the cars. They have not used it.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets where a child can cross and live. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
