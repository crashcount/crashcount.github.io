Two of them on foot. One on a bike.</strong> In Marine Park-Plumb Island, the years do not pass quietly. From 2022 through early June 2025, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>372 crashes</a> tore through these streets. <strong>238 people were hurt.</strong> No one walks away the same. The dead do not walk away at all.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists are the first to pay.</strong> Two pedestrians killed. One cyclist, age 91, did not make it home. The Belt Parkway runs through the heart of this district. It is a river of steel. It does not forgive mistakes. It does not care who steps into its path.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-suvs-and-the-unending-risk>The Pattern: Cars, SUVs, and the Unending Risk</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans are the weapons of choice.</strong> Of the five deaths, three came at the hands of cars or SUVs. No motorcycles or mopeds took a life here in this period. No trucks or buses. The numbers do not lie. <strong>Every year, the same story: drivers, speed, and the bodies left behind.</strong></p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In the last twelve months, eight people under 18 were hurt. One was killed. The youngest victims do not get a headline. They get a hospital bed, or worse.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They talk about lowering speed limits, about cameras, about safer crossings. But here, the carnage continues. <strong>No new laws, no bold action from local leaders.</strong> The silence is heavy. The numbers are not.</p><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. <strong><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Speed cameras</a> work. Lower speed limits save lives.</strong> But action is slow. The dead are not coming back.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets where children can cross and live. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
