The living carry scars.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and seventy-seven were injured</strong> in 101 crashes. Children, elders, workers. No one is spared.

Action is slow.</p><p>No leader in this district has stood up and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has demanded the citywide 20 mph limit.

The contest partners with the 'Hip Hop 50' campaign, blending street safety with city culture. Winners receive prizes from The Safe Streets Fund.

The bill aimed to 'prohibit the issuance of multiple bus lane violation tickets for the same infraction within a one hour period.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Narcisse, Ung, Stevens, and Yeger. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The stated purpose was to ensure drivers are not penalized repeatedly for a single bus lane violation. But the bill failed to advance. No changes came for vulnerable road users. Bus riders and pedestrians still face blocked lanes and slow emergency response. The city’s dangerous status quo remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
