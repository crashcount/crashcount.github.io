The living carry scars.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and seventy-seven were injured</strong> in 101 crashes. Children, elders, workers. No one is spared.

Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to 'prohibit the issuance of multiple bus lane violation tickets for the same infraction within a one hour period.' Council Member Farah N.

The stated purpose was to ensure drivers are not penalized repeatedly for a single bus lane violation. But the bill failed to advance. No changes came for vulnerable road users. Bus riders and pedestrians still face blocked lanes and slow emergency response. The city’s dangerous status quo remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
