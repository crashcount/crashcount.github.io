Ninety-six injured. Zero serious injuries, but the numbers do not tell the whole story. In the last twelve months, Marine Park-Plumb Island saw 126 crashes. Last month, a 22-year-old man died on the Belt Parkway. His car flipped. He was ejected. He did not make it home. The cause: unsafe speed and driver distraction.

The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-change>Patterns That Do Not Change</h3><p>Most injuries and deaths come from cars and SUVs. Pedestrians are killed crossing highways, not at intersections, with no signal to protect them. In the last three years, six people have died on these streets. Two were pedestrians. Four were drivers or passengers. Children are not spared—nine injured in the past year alone.</p><p>The numbers do not fade. They pile up. The city moves on.

Three bills on the table: daylighting, truck parking, fine relief. Lawmakers pressed for safer intersections and less chaos. Advocates rallied for clear corners. Truckers and drivers want relief. Streets remain dangerous. Action still pending.</p><p class=mb3>On April 21, 2025, the City Council’s transportation committee held a hearing on parking policy. Three bills were considered: a daylighting bill by Councilmember Julie Won to ban parking near crosswalks and require 1,000 daylighting barriers per year; a bill by Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse to waive extra fees for late parking ticket responses; and a bill by Councilmember Natasha Williams to create overnight truck parking in industrial zones. The matter summary reads: 'NYC Council to examine truck parking, daylighting and fine relief in hearing on city parking woes.' Narcisse’s bill targets fee relief for drivers who respond to violations between 45 and 90 days. Won’s daylighting bill drew support from 120 organizations. DOT faced questions on loading zones, permit abuse, and intersection safety. The hearing spotlighted the city’s struggle to balance safety for pedestrians and cyclists with business and driver concerns. No final votes yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, with a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' struck the family as they crossed the street. The bill would require speed-limiting technology for drivers with repeated offenses—those with 11 or more points in 24 months, or six camera tickets in a year. Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, citing the crash, demand action: 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair... it’s time for us to act.'
