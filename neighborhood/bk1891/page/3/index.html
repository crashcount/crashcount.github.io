Two hundred thirty-eight injured.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Marine Park-Plumb Island since 2022. No one walks away untouched. The dead do not speak. The living carry scars.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and seventy-seven were injured</strong> in 101 crashes. Children, elders, workers. No one is spared. The numbers are smaller this year, but the pain is not. The last year saw a drop in deaths, but the bodies still fall.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>A 55-year-old man, crushed by an SUV on the Belt Parkway. A 40-year-old woman, struck by a sedan. A 91-year-old cyclist, killed on the same stretch of road. The stories repeat. The details change. The outcome does not.</p><p>On the Marine Parkway Bridge, a string cut two cyclists. One nearly lost his life. &ldquo;It was an incredible amount of blood,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/incredible-amount-of-blood-but-nypd-finds-no-crime-after-string-slices-bicyclists-on-bridge>said Joey Eisler</a>. &ldquo;It was an image that will stay with me, the look of someone who just had their throat cut.&rdquo; The city called it an accident. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders, but only if Albany keeps them running. The law is there. The will is not always. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are made. Action is slow.</p><p>No leader in this district has stood up and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has demanded the citywide 20 mph limit. No one has called for more cameras, more redesigns, more protection for those outside a car. <strong>Silence is a choice.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to protect speed cameras. Tell them to put people before cars.

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, cleared the Council with 40 votes in favor and eight against. The bill's summary states it 'legalizes jaywalking, allowing pedestrians to walk into the street outside of crosswalks.' Narcisse stressed, 'Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.' The legislation removes jaywalking as a pretext for police stops, though officers may still intervene for other reasons. The Department of Transportation must now educate the public on street rights and responsibilities.
