In Canarsie Park & Pier, the numbers pile up. In the past twelve months, 97 people were injured in 106 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). No deaths this year. But pain is not measured only in funerals. It is measured in broken bones, concussions, and the long silence after the crash.</p><p>Children are not spared. Ten kids under 18 were hurt in the last year. The oldest victims are not spared either. Nine people aged 65 to 74, and six over 75, were injured. The road does not care about age. It takes what it wants.</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h3><p>The Belt Parkway and Rockaway Parkway see the worst. Crash after crash, the same streets, the same story. Drivers distracted, following too close, failing to yield. Sometimes the cause is as simple as &ldquo;brakes defective.&rdquo; Sometimes it is just &ldquo;inattention.&rdquo;</p><p>No one is immune. Drivers, passengers, pedestrians—all were injured in the last year. But the machines are the same: sedans, SUVs, trucks. No bikes, mopeds, or motorcycles caused serious harm here. The danger comes on four wheels, heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can act. But the limit is not yet lowered. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The law that keeps them running is up for renewal. Every delay is a risk. Every day without action is another day someone gets hurt.</p><p>Local leaders have tools. They have not used them all. The silence is loud. The waiting is deadly. The numbers do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The state can keep speed cameras on. Local leaders can demand safer streets—not just for drivers, but for everyone who walks, bikes, or waits at the curb.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. The next crash is not an accident. It is a choice. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill stated: “Pedestrians may cross any roadway at any point, including outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk, and allow for crossing against traffic signals. It would legalize the activity commonly referred to as ‘jaywalking’ and specify that no penalties can be imposed for jaywalking.” Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Narcisse, Won, Farías, Hanif, Ayala, Richardson Jordan, Krishnan, and Nurse. The bill superseded state law and removed penalties for pedestrian movement. Filed at session’s end, it did not advance.
