In Canarsie Park & Pier, the numbers pile up. In the past twelve months, 97 people were injured in 106 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). No deaths this year. But pain is not measured only in funerals. It is measured in broken bones, concussions, and the long silence after the crash.</p><p>Children are not spared. Ten kids under 18 were hurt in the last year. The oldest victims are not spared either. Nine people aged 65 to 74, and six over 75, were injured. The road does not care about age. It takes what it wants.</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h3><p>The Belt Parkway and Rockaway Parkway see the worst. Crash after crash, the same streets, the same story. Drivers distracted, following too close, failing to yield. Sometimes the cause is as simple as &ldquo;brakes defective.&rdquo; Sometimes it is just &ldquo;inattention.&rdquo;</p><p>No one is immune. Drivers, passengers, pedestrians—all were injured in the last year. But the machines are the same: sedans, SUVs, trucks. No bikes, mopeds, or motorcycles caused serious harm here. The danger comes on four wheels, heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can act. But the limit is not yet lowered. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The law that keeps them running is up for renewal. Every delay is a risk. Every day without action is another day someone gets hurt.</p><p>Local leaders have tools. They have not used them all. The silence is loud. The waiting is deadly. The numbers do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The state can keep speed cameras on. Local leaders can demand safer streets—not just for drivers, but for everyone who walks, bikes, or waits at the curb.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. The next crash is not an accident. It is a choice. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He refused a Breathalyzer test at the scene. He was charged with driving while intoxicated, driving while impaired, and refusing the test. The Department of Education referred questions to the NYPD. The incident highlights the ongoing risk posed by impaired drivers and the vulnerability of anyone near city streets, even when parked.

The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving. The article highlights the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill, which would require speed limiter devices for drivers with six or more camera violations in a year.

Grief and anger fill Borough Hall’s steps.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on April 1, 2025, that lawmakers are renewing calls for the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill after a Brooklyn crash killed a mother and two daughters, leaving a son in critical condition. The driver had a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' according to State Senator Andrew Gounardes. The bill would require speed-limiting devices for drivers with repeated violations or high point totals. Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall, urging swift passage. The article notes that similar measures, like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act, have struggled with implementation. The crash highlights gaps in enforcement and policy, as auto deaths now outpace gun deaths in New York City for the second year running.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, championed by Councilwoman Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, cleared the chamber in a veto-proof 40-8 vote. The bill's matter title: 'Jaywalking in NYC is set to be legal.' The legislation eliminates the $250 fine for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione testified against the bill, warning, 'Over the last five years, 200 people lost their lives while crossing the street mid-block or against the signal, making up about 34 percent of all pedestrian fatalities.' Mayor Eric Adams neither signed nor vetoed the bill, allowing it to become law. City Hall and NYPD officials continue to urge pedestrians to follow traffic rules. The Department of Transportation must now draft rules to implement the change. Vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
