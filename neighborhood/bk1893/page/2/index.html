In Canarsie Park & Pier, the numbers pile up. In the past twelve months, 97 people were injured in 106 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). No deaths this year. But pain is not measured only in funerals. It is measured in broken bones, concussions, and the long silence after the crash.</p><p>Children are not spared. Ten kids under 18 were hurt in the last year. The oldest victims are not spared either. Nine people aged 65 to 74, and six over 75, were injured. The road does not care about age. It takes what it wants.</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h3><p>The Belt Parkway and Rockaway Parkway see the worst. Crash after crash, the same streets, the same story. Drivers distracted, following too close, failing to yield. Sometimes the cause is as simple as &ldquo;brakes defective.&rdquo; Sometimes it is just &ldquo;inattention.&rdquo;</p><p>No one is immune. Drivers, passengers, pedestrians—all were injured in the last year. But the machines are the same: sedans, SUVs, trucks. No bikes, mopeds, or motorcycles caused serious harm here. The danger comes on four wheels, heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can act. But the limit is not yet lowered. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The law that keeps them running is up for renewal. Every delay is a risk. Every day without action is another day someone gets hurt.</p><p>Local leaders have tools. They have not used them all. The silence is loud. The waiting is deadly. The numbers do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The state can keep speed cameras on. Local leaders can demand safer streets—not just for drivers, but for everyone who walks, bikes, or waits at the curb.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. The next crash is not an accident. It is a choice. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prosecutors allege Yarimi drove nearly 70 mph, ran red lights, and turned right on red with a suspended license and dozens of prior speeding tickets. She struck a for-hire car, then hit Natasha Saada and her three children, killing the mother and two daughters. The surviving son remains in a coma. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called it 'among the worst collisions he has seen in his 25 years.' The article notes that advocates are pushing for laws requiring speed-limiters on cars of repeat speeders. Yarimi awaits trial, facing up to 15 years if convicted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall to demand action. The article notes that auto deaths have outpaced gun deaths in New York City for two years.
