City records list head pain and a westbound SUV in the crash log (CrashID 4832489) (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>They are one of the <strong>332 people injured across 382 crashes</strong> in Canarsie Park & Pier since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). This year, injuries are up to <strong>83</strong> from <strong>73</strong> at this point last year, and crashes are up to <strong>83</strong> from <strong>77</strong> — a 13.7% and 7.8% rise, respectively (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=where-the-bodies-get-broken>Where the bodies get broken</h2><p>Belt Parkway tops this map with <strong>195 injuries</strong> tied to it. Seaview Avenue, Shore Parkway, and Rockaway Parkway follow (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). At Seaview and E 93 Street, a 34‑year‑old pedestrian crossing with the signal was hit by a left‑turning sedan; the log flags driver distraction (CrashID 4817861) (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). At Rockaway Parkway and Shore Parkway, a turning SUV struck a pedestrian who had the signal; the report cites failure to yield (CrashID 4699623) (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Most pedestrian injuries here involve SUVs and sedans — <strong>9 of 13</strong> in the period tallied (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=the-clock-tells-on-us>The clock tells on us</h2><p>Injuries spike around <strong>3 PM</strong> and again near <strong>midnight</strong> in this area’s records, with heavy counts also at <strong>2 PM</strong> and <strong>11 AM</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Night conditions keep showing up in the patterns noted for this zone.</p><p>That Aug 1 crash at Seaview and Remsen was not the first there this summer. On Jul 20 at the same corner, a westbound sedan hit a man pushing a car; both were knocked unconscious, the log says (CrashID 4829299) (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=simple-fixes-named-corners>Simple fixes, named corners</h2><p>Turn crashes at Rockaway Parkway and Shore Parkway call for daylighting and hardened turns so drivers see people in the crosswalks. Signals at Seaview Avenue corners need leading pedestrian intervals to put walkers out front before the turn starts. Along Belt Parkway ramps and service roads, the nighttime injury pattern argues for lighting and targeted enforcement. These interventions match what the records show: turning drivers failing to yield and people hit while they have the walk.</p><h2 id=who-moves-first>Who moves first</h2><p>This district’s electeds know the levers. State Senator <a href=/senate-district/19/>Roxanne Persaud</a> voted yes in committee for the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong>, which would force repeat speeders to use speed limiters (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/59/>Jaime Williams</a> voted to extend school speed zones this year, according to the record. Council Member <a href=/council-district/46/>Mercedes Narcisse</a> backed legal jaywalking reforms and has pushed other traffic bills through Council hearings.</p><p>The next steps are on the table. <strong>Lower the city default speed limit</strong> and <strong>pass the speed limiter bill</strong> for repeat violators. Slow the turns at Seaview. Protect the crossings on Rockaway. Fix the ramps that feed the Belt. Then check the logs again.</p><p>One call helps move it.

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, cleared the Council with 40 votes in favor and eight against. The bill's summary states it 'legalizes jaywalking, allowing pedestrians to walk into the street outside of crosswalks.' Narcisse stressed, 'Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.' The legislation removes jaywalking as a pretext for police stops, though officers may still intervene for other reasons. The Department of Transportation must now educate the public on street rights and responsibilities.

Advocates warned new language could blame pedestrians for crashes. The bill would have let people cross mid-block, but now demands they yield to drivers. Racial bias in enforcement remains unaddressed.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2024, the City Council delayed action on a bill to legalize jaywalking. The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with advocates demanding stronger protections for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, proposed by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, seeks to end criminal penalties for crossing streets outside crosswalks. The matter summary states officials argue, 'keeping it illegal protects pedestrian safety.' DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione testified against full legalization, supporting only a reduction to a civil offense. NYPD Deputy Chief Thomas Alps defended targeted enforcement in high-crash areas. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the law's fairness, noting most tickets go to Black and Brown New Yorkers. Advocates criticized the city's stance, saying criminalization does not improve safety and harms communities of color.

The measure heads to its first hearing before the transportation committee. Narcisse’s bill responds to city data: in 2023, 92 percent of jaywalking summonses went to Black or Latino New Yorkers; in early 2024, that number rose to 96.5 percent. Narcisse calls this 'a troubling picture of racial disparities.' She states, 'Jaywalking should not be a criminal matter that disproportionately impacts certain groups based on race or ethnicity.' Narcisse urges the city to redirect police resources and end selective enforcement. The bill aims to protect the rights of all residents and promote equity in city policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Black and Latino New Yorkers bear the brunt. The bill would legalize crossing mid-block and against the light. Only eight council members back it. NYPD stays silent.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2024, Council Member Mercedes Narcisse of Brooklyn introduced a bill to decriminalize jaywalking in New York City. The bill, currently with only eight co-sponsors out of 51, aims to 'permit pedestrians to legally cross a roadway at any point, including outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk, and allow for crossing against traffic signals.' Narcisse states the goal is to 'legalize the activity commonly referred to as 'jaywalking' and specify that no penalties can be imposed.' The move follows years of data showing NYPD’s racially biased enforcement: in 2023, 92 percent of jaywalking tickets went to Black or Latino residents, who make up just 55 percent of the city’s population. Lawmakers have long sought to end this pattern. The NYPD did not comment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
