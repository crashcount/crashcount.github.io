Same ending.</p><ul><li>A 29-year-old man crossed with the signal at 212th Street and Hillside Avenue before dawn. A box truck turned left and crushed him. Police coded driver distraction and an oversized vehicle. He died there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYPD data</a> lists it as CrashID 4789587.</li><li>On the Cross Island Parkway near 112th Avenue, unsafe speed and a blown control ended a woman driver’s life. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4648067</a> marks it plain: “Unsafe Speed,” “Traffic Control Disregarded.”</li><li>Southbound lanes. A 2018 Honda and a 2025 BMW hit. A 76-year-old woman in the right rear seat died. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4825309</a> carries her record.</li></ul><p>“Police said the operator fled the scene after hitting the man.” The 52-year-old pedestrian near JFK never made it home. The driver ran. No arrests. That’s how the precinct logs it in the press. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>Daily News</a>.</p><p>Speed kills here. The dataset for this neighborhood shows “other” and speed-linked factors leading the harm, with pedestrians taking 139 injuries and one death since 2022. The clock tells on us too: injuries peak from late afternoon into the night, with heavy counts around 6 p.m., 8 p.m., and 9 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>The Cross Island Parkway is a knife edge. It leads the map: 3 deaths, 181 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Top locations</a>.</li><li>212th Street sees hurt stack up too, with serious injuries on the board. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Location rollup</a>.</li></ul><p>The numbers point to simple work: slow cars before they turn, guard the crossings, and tame trucks at signals. Hardened turns. Daylighting. Leading pedestrian intervals. Truck turns that crawl, not cut. Night hours need light and enforcement where the injuries spike. The data also flags heavy vehicles in the harm to people on foot; a truck killed the man at Hillside and 212th. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4789587</a>.</p><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany gave the city the power to lower speeds. The city has the cameras around schools. Advocates and survivors have called on leaders to use that power and drop speeds to 20 mph. They have also pushed to rein in the worst drivers. Our prior coverage lays out the ask and the evidence. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>In Albany, the Stop Super Speeders Act moved. Senators backed a bill to force repeat violators to install speed limiters. Sen. Leroy Comrie voted yes in committee. So did Sen. Toby Ann Stavisky. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a>. The case for action is not abstract; it is written in broken bodies and camera records. Families and survivors have carried that message to the Capitol. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>Wrong-way terror shows another crack. A Queens driver took the expressway the wrong direction and hit five cars. A judge gave him eight years. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers,” the Queens DA said. Lee told police he felt “liberated.” <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>. Access control and speed control are not theory here. They are the difference between a near miss and a morgue.</p><p>The toll this year</p><ul><li>From Jan. 1 to Aug. 24, this neighborhood logged 405 crashes, 270 injuries, and two deaths. That is a 52% jump in crashes over last year to date. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Neighborhood stats</a>.</li><li>Pedestrians were struck most often by sedans and SUVs. Trucks did fewer hits but took a life. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Mode rollups</a>.</li></ul><p>What must move now</p><ul><li>Put LPIs and hardened turns at Hillside & 212th, and along the 212th Street spine. Clear the corners. Protect the walk.</li><li>Target the Cross Island Parkway entrances and service roads for speed control and night enforcement. The injury curve after sunset demands it.</li><li>Route and manage trucks at left-turn hotspots. The data names them.</li></ul><p>Citywide, two steps can cut the blood loss fast: lower the default speed limit and force speed limiters on serial violators. The tools exist. The names on our list do too. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
