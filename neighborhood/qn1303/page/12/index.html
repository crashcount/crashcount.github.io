A truck turns left. He is crushed. On Hillside Avenue and 212th Street, a 29-year-old pedestrian was killed by a box truck. The cause: driver inattention. The truck kept moving. The man did not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, two people died on Queens Village streets. 318 were injured. Not one was marked as a serious injury, but the wounds run deep.

Just steel and speed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 64-year-old man died behind the wheel.

They count the dead. They promise action. But the pace is slow. The carnage is not.

Leroy Comrie drew a hard line. No exemptions for Manhattan’s congestion tolls. He stood firm as others called for carve-outs. His stance means every car pays. No relief for drivers. The city’s most vulnerable stay in the crosshairs.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2022, State Senator Leroy Comrie made a public statement on congestion pricing exemptions. The matter, covered by nypost.com, centers on calls from Mayor Eric Adams for more exemptions to the Manhattan congestion tolls. Adams argued, 'there should be a level of exemptions... so that we’re not overburdening New Yorkers.' But Comrie rejected this, stating, 'I don’t think there should be any exemptions, and I’m going to continue to say that there should be no exemptions.' The congestion pricing plan, passed in 2019, already exempts emergency vehicles, vehicles carrying disabled New Yorkers, and low-income residents inside the zone. Comrie’s stance keeps the system strict. No new carve-outs. The Traffic Mobility Review Board may still consider more, but Comrie’s position is clear: every driver pays the toll, no exceptions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They want Far Rockaway and more LIRR stations in the fare program. The move aims to cut commute times and boost transit use. The bill is filed, not enacted.</p><p class=mb3>Res 0108-2022 was introduced on April 14, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution urges the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to 'expand and make permanent the Atlantic Ticket pilot in order to include Far Rockaway, and other stations along the LIRR corridor, in the fare affordability program.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Yeger, Stevens, Hanif, Bottcher, Krishnan, and many others. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. The Atlantic Ticket pilot, launched in 2018, gave Southeast Queens and Brooklyn riders cheaper LIRR fares. Advocates say expanding it citywide could mean faster, safer commutes and more transit riders. The council’s action highlights the need for affordable, accessible transit—especially for neighborhoods with long, punishing commutes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
