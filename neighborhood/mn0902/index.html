Three months earlier, she allegedly hit a pedestrian in Brooklyn and fled. Police charged her with leaving the scene and aggravated unlicensed operation, but she was released without bail, as the charges were not bail-eligible under state law. The article notes, "The out-of-control driver... had been freed without bail in April after she was arrested for leaving the scene of a crash that badly injured a pedestrian." The case highlights gaps in bail policy and enforcement for unlicensed, repeat dangerous driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
