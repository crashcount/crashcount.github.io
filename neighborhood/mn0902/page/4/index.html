No one is safe.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-done>What Leaders Have Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They promise safer streets. They add a few bike lanes. They lower some speed limits. But the blood keeps flowing. The council votes. The mayor speaks. The dead stay dead.</p><p><strong>Sammy’s Law passed.</strong> The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit hasn’t dropped here. The law sits on a desk.

It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The detour, implemented with scant notice, lacks protected bike lanes and clear signage. Cyclists must share space with cars, cross highway ramps, and navigate steep slopes. The matter, described as 'shortsighted' by Council Member Shaun Abreu, repeats failures from a similar closure four years ago. Abreu urged the city to create a 'sustainable, workable detour' for vulnerable riders. Cyclists voiced frustration and fear, with some riding on pedestrian paths or even the highway to avoid danger. The city’s reliance on 'Share the Road' signs and sharrows leaves riders exposed. The detour has led to nearly one injury per week, highlighting the city’s disregard for cyclist safety during infrastructure work.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sedan's left front bumper absorbed the impact, and no other vehicles or road users were involved. The narrative underscores the severity of the collision and the role of impaired driving.

The DOT proposal, intended to speed up the M96 bus for 15,000 daily riders, would repurpose a travel lane in each direction while preserving curb parking. Abreu stated, "I wouldn’t say I’m opposed or in favor at this point," but called for more clarity and adjustments from DOT. The matter, described as a push to 'torpedo planned bus lane on 96th Street,' has drawn support from East Side's Community Board 8 and opposition from West Side locals and Council Member Gale Brewer, who suggested alternatives like bus signal priority. The debate centers on balancing transit improvements with residential curb access.

Brewer claimed support for bus lanes elsewhere.</p><p class=mb3>On September 5, 2024, Council Member Gale Brewer publicly opposed a dedicated bus lane on West 96th Street at a rally. The matter, described as a 'City Council member public statement/rally regarding bus lane project,' saw Brewer call on DOT to remove two blocks from the crosstown bus lane plan, citing the area's 'residential character' and questioning the need due to 'current bus speeds.' Brewer, who once backed bus lanes on 14th, 34th, and 181st Streets, now argued for alternatives and said, 'I'm a bus rider who takes this bus every day. It's not slow.' DOT countered that parking would be preserved and loading zones added. Transit advocates criticized Brewer for ignoring data on slow westbound buses and the needs of 15,000 daily riders. Council Member Shaun Abreu, who represents the district, did not attend and stated he does not oppose the bus lane. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation will install up to 1,500 large, Madrid-made bins in West Harlem parking spaces, targeting buildings with more than 31 units. The pilot, launched last year, replaces sidewalk trash bags with secure, stationary bins. Abreu said, 'I couldn’t be more thrilled that Barcelona is making its way to New York City – but unfortunately for the rats, that means no tapas for them.' The bins, emptied by new trucks, have already reduced rat complaints and cleaned up streets. Some residents worry about lost parking, but others, like Esther Yoon, praise the cleaner, safer sidewalks. The city will spend up to $700,000 annually on the program, aiming to expand across all boroughs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bills aim to address 'myriad health and safety concerns' from e-bike crashes, battery fires, and low pay. Councilmember Lynn Schulman, District 29, spoke out: 'Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed... This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk.' Three bills would make apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash responsible for vehicle safety and compliance, require them to provide safety-compliant e-bikes, and ensure mopeds are registered. Other bills target pay transparency and tip protections. Councilmembers Shaun Abreu and Rafael Salamanca also spoke in support. The measures seek to hold companies accountable for dangers faced by vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
