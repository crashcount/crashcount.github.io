Six suffered serious injuries.</strong> The young are not spared. In the last year, 18 children were hurt. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Trucks and motorcycles add to the toll. No one is immune.</p><p>Pedestrians are struck at intersections and in the street. Cyclists are hit. Drivers and passengers are crushed in metal and glass. The numbers rise and fall, but the pain stays.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city passed new laws. Speed cameras now run day and night. The speed limit can be lowered. But in Throgs Neck-Schuylerville, the danger remains. <strong>The Bronx saw a 4% rise in car thefts this year, even as rates fell citywide</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-carjacking-victim-violent-car-theft-has-leg-amputated-leaving-work-jfk-airport/16247931/>reported ABC7</a>. Local leaders talk about safety. The streets do not change. The blood dries and the news moves on.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand more cameras. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Do not wait for another neighbor to bleed in the gutter.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
