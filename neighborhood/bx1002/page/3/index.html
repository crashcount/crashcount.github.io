Six suffered serious injuries.</strong> The young are not spared. In the last year, 18 children were hurt. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Trucks and motorcycles add to the toll. No one is immune.</p><p>Pedestrians are struck at intersections and in the street. Cyclists are hit. Drivers and passengers are crushed in metal and glass. The numbers rise and fall, but the pain stays.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city passed new laws. Speed cameras now run day and night. The speed limit can be lowered. But in Throgs Neck-Schuylerville, the danger remains. <strong>The Bronx saw a 4% rise in car thefts this year, even as rates fell citywide</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-carjacking-victim-violent-car-theft-has-leg-amputated-leaving-work-jfk-airport/16247931/>reported ABC7</a>. Local leaders talk about safety. The streets do not change. The blood dries and the news moves on.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand more cameras. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Do not wait for another neighbor to bleed in the gutter.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz stated, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz highlighted the broader issue: "We’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced." The incident underscores the risks posed by illegal parking and the need for stricter enforcement and infrastructure checks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.'
