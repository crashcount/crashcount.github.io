But the wounds run deep. Since January 2022, two people have been killed and five left with serious injuries on the streets of Pelham Bay-Country Club-City Island. 286 neighbors have been hurt in 481 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but bodies do.</p><p>Last week, a pedestrian suffered a leg fracture on Bruckner Boulevard. In April, a man was crushed between an SUV and a sedan on Wilkinson Avenue. In May, a woman crossing with the signal was struck by a turning truck at Buhre and Bruckner. The pain is not abstract. It is a broken leg, a crushed body, a life changed in a moment.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-harm>The Machines That Harm</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. Of the pedestrians hurt or killed, SUVs were involved in 18 cases, sedans in 15, trucks in 2, and buses in 2. One person was killed by a GMC SUV on Westchester Avenue. Another was crushed by a sedan and SUV on Wilkinson. The machines are heavy. The bodies are not.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>State Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the law. The bill aims to stop the worst offenders before they kill again. Assembly Member Michael Benedetto voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children at the curb.</p><p>But Council Member Kristy Marmorato has fought to keep parking mandates near new transit, saying, &ldquo;We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/07/bronx-metro-north-rezoning-parking-mandates>argued</a>). The city keeps making room for cars. The street stays deadly for everyone else.</p><h3 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h3><p>After a crash in Co-op City, a witness said, &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>recalled</a>). Another called it &ldquo;a terrible sound &ndash; it was a terrible incident that happened&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>described</a>). The horror is plain. The street is not safe.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every injury, every death, is a policy choice. Call your council member. Call your state reps. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets built for people, not machines. Do not wait for another body on the ground.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
