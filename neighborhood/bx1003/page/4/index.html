He was dragged for a block and a half. His head and leg smashed against the street. Witnesses saw the blood. They saw the leg twisted wrong. He was left in critical condition. Police said, &ldquo;A man trying to stop his car from being stolen suffered critical injuries in the Bronx&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-critically-injured-trying-stop-suspect-stealing-car-bronx/16241521/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A pedestrian crossing with the signal at Buhre Avenue was crushed by a turning truck. A 40-year-old man was killed by an SUV on Westchester Avenue. A motorcycle rider was thrown from his bike on Waterbury Avenue. The numbers do not stop. In the last twelve months, <strong>89 people were injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>1 person suffered a serious injury. No deaths in the last year, but the scars run deep</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-harm>The Machines That Harm</h3><p>SUVs, sedans, and trucks do most of the damage. In three years, SUVs killed and seriously injured more pedestrians here than any other vehicle. Trucks and sedans follow close behind. No bikes killed anyone. The danger is steel and speed, not spokes.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about lowering speed limits. They talk about cameras and enforcement. But in Pelham Bay, Country Club, and City Island, the pace is slow. The streets do not change. The crashes keep coming. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise. No new laws. No new protections. The same old story.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-more-than-words><strong>Act Now: Demand More Than Words</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand lower speed limits, more cameras, and real street redesigns.</strong> Do not wait for another body in the road. Do not wait for another family to grieve. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action today.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The session, supported by Councilmember Kristy Marmorato (District 13) and Councilmember Amanda Farias, highlighted the need for faster, more reliable transit.

Farias called it part of a 'better transit future.' The Department of City Planning updated residents, reflecting ongoing community feedback.

The need is urgent.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A 1280, now in the sponsorship stage, sits before the New York State Assembly. Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous. Lawmakers are under pressure to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
