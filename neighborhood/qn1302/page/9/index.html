In the last year alone, 168 people were hurt. Nineteen were under 18. The oldest victim was 92, killed behind the wheel, airbag deployed, life ended on Union Turnpike. The young are bruised, the old are broken, and the rest carry the scars.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-the-same-story-again-and-again>Recent Crashes: The Same Story, Again and Again</h3><p>The pattern is relentless. On June 13, a 30-year-old woman was left with a head injury after her SUV struck another car on the Grand Central Parkway.<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> On June 4, a 38-year-old man was bruised in a crash at Jericho Turnpike.<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> On May 16, a 21-year-old woman suffered abdominal pain after a collision on the Cross Island Parkway.<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> The details change. The pain does not.</p><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, not a single pedestrian was killed by a bike or moped. But sedans and SUVs have left dozens of pedestrians hurt. The numbers are cold, but the truth is clear: the danger comes from heavy, fast machines.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—and What They Haven&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not always forward. <strong>State Senator Toby Stavisky <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices.</strong> Assembly Member Ed Braunstein <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">voted to extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children at the curb. Council Member Linda Lee, meanwhile, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored a bill to let ambulettes double-park and block bus lanes</a>, squeezing the most vulnerable at the curb.</p><p><strong>Some leaders fight for safety. Others make it harder to walk, ride, or wait for a bus.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made upstream. Call your council member. Call your state senator. Tell them: Enough. No more loopholes for drivers. No more blocked bus lanes. No more waiting for the next name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Demand action. Demand safe streets. Demand it now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No new money means service cuts or fare hikes loom.</p><p class=mb3>On February 16, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams traveled to Albany to oppose Governor Hochul’s proposal for New York City to contribute an extra $500 million annually to the MTA. Adams argued, “MTA is a statewide obligation. We’re doing our share.” State lawmakers, including Assembly Member Ed Braunstein and State Senator Liz Krueger, countered that the city should help. Hochul’s budget would shift more costs—like Access-A-Ride and student Metrocards—to the city. Progressive lawmakers suggested taxing the wealthy and freezing fares. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins warned, “To increase fares would be detrimental.” The debate continues as the legislature drafts its own budget. No direct safety analysis was provided, but funding gaps threaten transit service, putting vulnerable riders at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
