A car turns. The man does not get up. In Richmond Hill, the story repeats. <strong>In the last twelve months, 188 people were injured in 317 crashes. One was left with life-altering wounds.</strong> No one died this year, but the numbers do not rest. They pile up. They wait.</p><p><strong>Since 2022, two people have died on these streets. Five more were seriously hurt.</strong> The young are not spared. Twenty-two children were injured in the last year alone. Cyclists and pedestrians take the brunt. A woman on a bike, bleeding on Myrtle Avenue. A pedestrian struck on Jamaica Avenue, not at an intersection. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt>The Machines That Hurt</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most damage.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, and trucks left pedestrians and cyclists broken. Motorcycles and mopeds added to the toll. Bikes, too, but the numbers are small. The city counts the bodies, but the pain is not counted.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They pass laws. They lower speed limits. They add cameras. But in Richmond Hill, the danger remains. <strong>Crashes are up 34% over last year. Injuries are up 33%.</strong></p><p>Local leaders have not spoken out. No new bills. No public stands. No press quotes. The silence is heavy. The streets stay the same. The people bleed.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every injury is a failure to act. <strong>You can break the silence.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A 62-year-old female driver of a 2019 Nissan SUV was traveling eastbound when her vehicle was struck on the left rear bumper by a 2024 Toyota taxi also traveling eastbound. The SUV driver, who was wearing a lap belt and remained conscious, sustained a neck injury described as whiplash.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The SUV struck the sedan's left front bumper with its center front end. The sedan's driver, a 44-year-old woman, suffered a head contusion but remained conscious and restrained. Police listed 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the main contributing factor, highlighting a failure to obey traffic signals. No other factors were cited. The crash left one person injured and exposed the danger of ignored controls on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill was introduced on September 12, 2024, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure the same day. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the operation of shared electric scooter systems on certain streets in the Borough of Queens.' Council Members Lynn C. Schulman (District 29, primary sponsor) and Sandra Ung (District 20, co-sponsor) back the measure. The bill would stop shared e-scooter organizations from operating in a dense, contested part of Queens. No safety analysis was provided. The legislation draws a hard line on who can move—and how—on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Schulman called for accountability.</p><p class=mb3>On June 21, 2024, the NYC Council's Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection held a hearing on seven bills regulating delivery apps. The bills aim to address 'myriad health and safety concerns' from e-bike crashes, battery fires, and low pay. Councilmember Lynn Schulman, District 29, spoke out: 'Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed... This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk.' Three bills would make apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash responsible for vehicle safety and compliance, require them to provide safety-compliant e-bikes, and ensure mopeds are registered. Other bills target pay transparency and tip protections. Councilmembers Shaun Abreu and Rafael Salamanca also spoke in support. The measures seek to hold companies accountable for dangers faced by vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, set to start June 30, would have charged drivers $15 to enter below 60th Street, raising $1 billion yearly for transit. Hochul proposed a payroll tax hike instead, but State Senator Liz Krueger opposed it, saying, "I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate." The bill’s fate is uncertain as the legislative session ends. The MTA board, city officials, and business groups all voiced concern. Projects like the Second Avenue Subway, subway accessibility, and zero-emission buses now face cancellation. No alternative funding plan exists. Vulnerable riders—those who rely on transit—stand to lose the most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
