A car turns. The man does not get up. In Richmond Hill, the story repeats. <strong>In the last twelve months, 188 people were injured in 317 crashes. One was left with life-altering wounds.</strong> No one died this year, but the numbers do not rest. They pile up. They wait.</p><p><strong>Since 2022, two people have died on these streets. Five more were seriously hurt.</strong> The young are not spared. Twenty-two children were injured in the last year alone. Cyclists and pedestrians take the brunt. A woman on a bike, bleeding on Myrtle Avenue. A pedestrian struck on Jamaica Avenue, not at an intersection. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt>The Machines That Hurt</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most damage.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, and trucks left pedestrians and cyclists broken. Motorcycles and mopeds added to the toll. Bikes, too, but the numbers are small. The city counts the bodies, but the pain is not counted.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They pass laws. They lower speed limits. They add cameras. But in Richmond Hill, the danger remains. <strong>Crashes are up 34% over last year. Injuries are up 33%.</strong></p><p>Local leaders have not spoken out. No new bills. No public stands. No press quotes. The silence is heavy. The streets stay the same. The people bleed.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every injury is a failure to act. <strong>You can break the silence.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

At arraignment, Barcia was released without surrendering his license. The Queens District Attorney’s office did not seek revocation. State Sen. Jessica Ramos led a rally, citing 'reckless drivers who refuse to yield to pedestrians' and called for stronger pedestrian safety, saying, 'driving is a privilege that can, and should be, taken away.' Adam White, a lawyer for crash victims, said the DA should have insisted Barcia not drive. The rally highlighted rising road deaths—48 killed citywide in early 2024—and called out the city’s failure to protect its most vulnerable.

Barcia had been arrested four times for unlicensed driving in 2009 and 2010, with two fines from guilty pleas. His North Carolina-plated pickup had eight camera-issued speeding tickets since June and over $350 in unpaid fines. Despite this, the Sheriff's department did not tow the vehicle. Barcia now faces criminally negligent homicide charges. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said, "Driving carries with it a huge responsibility... The rules of the road exist to safeguard everyone." Advocacy groups and officials called for traffic calming and stronger enforcement. The system failed to keep a dangerous driver off the street.

Enforcement waits.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0235-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 28, 2024, the bill commands the Department of Transportation and Parks to post signs warning cyclists, e-bike, and e-scooter riders: stay off sidewalks, park walkways, and boardwalks, or face fines. The matter title reads, 'A Local Law...notifying operators...of the prohibition against operating such devices on sidewalks, park walkways, and boardwalks, and of related fines and penalties.' Lincoln Restler sponsors, joined by Hudson, Brewer, Hanif, Gennaro, Abreu, Ung, and Schulman. The bill aims to keep vulnerable pedestrians safe by making the rules clear at every crossing and path. No safety analyst has weighed in yet. The measure waits in committee. The city’s warning signs may soon rise.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
