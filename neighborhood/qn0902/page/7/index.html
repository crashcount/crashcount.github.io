A car turns. The man does not get up. In Richmond Hill, the story repeats. <strong>In the last twelve months, 188 people were injured in 317 crashes. One was left with life-altering wounds.</strong> No one died this year, but the numbers do not rest. They pile up. They wait.</p><p><strong>Since 2022, two people have died on these streets. Five more were seriously hurt.</strong> The young are not spared. Twenty-two children were injured in the last year alone. Cyclists and pedestrians take the brunt. A woman on a bike, bleeding on Myrtle Avenue. A pedestrian struck on Jamaica Avenue, not at an intersection. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt>The Machines That Hurt</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most damage.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, and trucks left pedestrians and cyclists broken. Motorcycles and mopeds added to the toll. Bikes, too, but the numbers are small. The city counts the bodies, but the pain is not counted.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They pass laws. They lower speed limits. They add cameras. But in Richmond Hill, the danger remains. <strong>Crashes are up 34% over last year. Injuries are up 33%.</strong></p><p>Local leaders have not spoken out. No new bills. No public stands. No press quotes. The silence is heavy. The streets stay the same. The people bleed.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every injury is a failure to act. <strong>You can break the silence.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter title reads: 'Austin Street in Forest Hills should be transformed into a pedestrian paradise instead of the car-choked, will-sapping roadway it is today.' Pedro Rodriguez, a local advocate, pressed for urgent action, citing ongoing injuries and business impacts. Council Member Lynn Schulman did not comment. DOT spokesperson Vin Barone welcomed the board's support for Vision Zero and promised further discussions. From January 2018 to November 2022, 356 crashes caused 80 injuries on this stretch—most to pedestrians and cyclists.

The bill died in committee. Riders faced new rules, more scrutiny. The city’s cars kept killing. The council moved on. Vulnerable road users stayed exposed. The system failed to shift blame from drivers.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0758-2022 was introduced in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on October 12, 2022. The bill aimed to require every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter, and other legal motorized vehicle to be registered with the Department of Transportation and display a visible license plate. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.' Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections. The streets stayed dangerous. The cars kept their edge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
