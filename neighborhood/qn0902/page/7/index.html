A car turns. The man does not get up. In Richmond Hill, the story repeats. <strong>In the last twelve months, 188 people were injured in 317 crashes. One was left with life-altering wounds.</strong> No one died this year, but the numbers do not rest. They pile up. They wait.</p><p><strong>Since 2022, two people have died on these streets. Five more were seriously hurt.</strong> The young are not spared. Twenty-two children were injured in the last year alone. Cyclists and pedestrians take the brunt. A woman on a bike, bleeding on Myrtle Avenue. A pedestrian struck on Jamaica Avenue, not at an intersection. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt>The Machines That Hurt</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most damage.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, and trucks left pedestrians and cyclists broken. Motorcycles and mopeds added to the toll. Bikes, too, but the numbers are small. The city counts the bodies, but the pain is not counted.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They pass laws. They lower speed limits. They add cameras. But in Richmond Hill, the danger remains. <strong>Crashes are up 34% over last year. Injuries are up 33%.</strong></p><p>Local leaders have not spoken out. No new bills. No public stands. No press quotes. The silence is heavy. The streets stay the same. The people bleed.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every injury is a failure to act. <strong>You can break the silence.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure urges the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.1679/S.561, which would 'increase the penalty for leaving the scene of an accident involving an e-scooter and further calls upon the New York State Legislature to include e-bikes in such legislation.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Gale A. Brewer, Shaun Abreu, Lynn C. Schulman, and Amanda Farías backed the resolution. The bill would raise penalties for e-scooter hit-and-runs from a violation to a misdemeanor or felony, and seeks to add e-bikes to the law.

The editorial, titled "With politicians fearful of the TWU, a public referendum is the answer," criticizes the City Council’s failure to act on a bill that would replace horses with electric carriages. Schulman highlights that only 18 of 51 council members sponsor the bill, despite strong public support and past campaign promises. She names Justin Brennan, Gale Brewer, Julie Menin, and herself among those who have not advanced the legislation. Schulman blames union influence for the council’s inaction, citing 115 accidents and 27 horse deaths over decades.

The city stands at a crossroads.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2023, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) was mentioned in a public debate over New York City's congestion pricing policy. The matter, titled 'Straw Men: The Fight Over Congestion Pricing Comes Down to Just 5,200 NYC Drivers,' highlights that only 1.2% of residents far from fast transit drive into the congestion zone. Ariola, along with other council members, voiced concerns about impacts on small businesses and residents. The debate draws on MTA data showing most New Yorkers rely on public transit, not cars. Exemptions and discounts for disabled and low-income drivers are included in the policy. Advocates argue congestion pricing will reduce traffic, fund transit, and transform city streets for vulnerable road users. The council's discussion reflects a sharp divide between data and political narrative.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The request, not yet a formal bill, follows a campaign by resident Pedro Rodriguez and support from Queens Community Board 6. Schulman wrote, the goal is for DOT 'to identify ways to improve traffic congestion, pedestrian experience, and mobility concerns along the corridor.' She cited input from local businesses and residents. Proposed changes include wider sidewalks, safer crossings, outdoor seating, and possibly pedestrianizing segments. From January 2018 to November 2022, 48 pedestrians and cyclists were injured in 356 crashes on Austin Street. DOT is reviewing Schulman's letter.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
