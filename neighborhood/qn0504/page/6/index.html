The numbers are here, cold and unyielding.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero and safer streets.

After the firetruck killed the cyclist, a witness said, &ldquo;One of them seemed concerned, like shaken, like shocked&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/19/us-news/fdny-firetruck-strikes-kills-cyclist-outside-nyc-park/>New York Post</a>). The NYPD investigates. The leaders wait. No new laws. No redesigns. No public statements from the council or board. The silence is heavy.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day without change is a choice. Call your council member. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand slower speeds.

Brooks-Powers (District 31), chair of the City Council’s Transportation Committee, came under fire after media reports revealed her family car received 25 traffic tickets in 16 months, including 20 for speeding near schools. The controversy centers on officials’ personal compliance with traffic laws while publicly supporting measures like speed cameras and congestion pricing. Brooks-Powers, who has promoted speed cameras and legislation to reward reporting hit-and-run drivers, claims her husband was responsible for the violations and that she has not used the car in over a year. Councilman Robert Holden called her a 'hypocrite,' while safe streets advocate Adam White stressed, 'Public officials and their families need to abide by speed cameras and red lights... people’s lives are at risk.' The incident highlights the gap between public safety advocacy and personal conduct, raising questions about accountability and public trust.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill remains stalled in committee as lawmakers demand broader reforms. Supporters argue that keeping basement units illegal endangers tenants and leaves them exposed to unsafe conditions.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the police department to report on the justification for the stop in vehicle encounter reports," demands the NYPD document every vehicle stop. Reports must include the reason for the stop, the level of offense, and demographic details, but no personal identifiers. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and others led the charge. The law aims to expose patterns in police stops and holds officers to account. Reports go online, open to all. This is a step toward transparency, not just for drivers, but for every New Yorker who walks, rides, or waits at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say it targets delivery workers, mostly immigrants and people of color. The bill would hand police more power to stop, fine, and harass riders. The city’s most vulnerable would pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On December 20, 2023, Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30) published an op-ed opposing his own bill to require registration and licensing for e-bikes and e-scooters. The bill, introduced in the New York City Council, would impact the city’s 65,000 app-based delivery workers. The op-ed warns: 'What might sound benign at first would actually lead to a substantial increase in state surveillance and regulation of New York City's 65,000 app-based delivery workers.' Holden’s action—introducing the bill—has drawn sharp criticism for enabling more NYPD stops and fines, especially against Black, Latine, and immigrant riders. The piece details how similar enforcement has led to racial profiling and financial hardship for those least able to bear it. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the op-ed makes clear: more policing means more danger for the city’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30) supported raising fines for drivers using fake or obscured plates. The matter, reported by Gothamist, highlights a surge in 'ghost cars'—vehicles with covered, defaced, or phony plates—dodging tolls and speed cameras. Holden stated, "If somebody can save a lot of money by obscuring their plates, they'll do it." The NYPD has increased enforcement, but many offenders remain undeterred. Advocates and experts, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, warn that without strict enforcement, congestion pricing goals and street safety will suffer. The city has banned camera-blocking covers and encourages public reporting, but unresolved complaints and repeat violations persist. Holden's push aims to make penalties outweigh the savings from toll evasion, seeking legislative action to protect the program's integrity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30) led a push for his bill requiring license plates and registration for all e-bikes, e-scooters, and similar vehicles. The bill, introduced last year, has 31 co-sponsors and awaits a hearing in the Council's transportation committee. Holden said, 'Let’s find out who they are,' targeting e-bike riders and citing safety concerns. The bill summary states it would require 'license plates and vehicle registrations for any electric bike, scooter or other motorized vehicle.' At a City Hall rally, Holden and supporters pointed to injuries and deaths from lithium-ion battery fires. Pamela Manasse, a crash survivor, called e-vehicles a danger. Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives criticized the bill, saying it shifts blame from drivers and ignores the need for safer street design and better regulation of e-bike sales and batteries. The debate follows Mayor Adams' pilot for public e-bike charging stations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
