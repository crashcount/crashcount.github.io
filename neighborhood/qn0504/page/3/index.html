The numbers are here, cold and unyielding.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero and safer streets.

The silence is heavy.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day without change is a choice. Call your council member. Demand protected bike lanes.

Holden (District 30) criticized the exemption of top city officials from New York’s $9 congestion toll. The controversy centers on the MTA’s emergency vehicle exemption, which lets law enforcement vehicles—including those chauffeuring Mayor Eric Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams—avoid the toll. The bill’s matter summary highlights the hypocrisy: 'They shouldn’t be exempt from congestion pricing. They shouldn’t have chauffeurs. It’s disgusting,' Holden said. Lander and Williams previously celebrated the toll’s benefits for transit and air quality, but now face backlash for not paying it themselves. The measure’s status is controversial, with no direct safety analyst note, but critics argue the exemption undermines public trust and leaves the city’s most vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders—bearing the burden.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, discussed in the article 'NYC residents slapped with congestion pricing ‘surcharge’ by fed-up companies paying new toll: ‘Hochul inflation’,' has sparked backlash. Queens Councilman Robert F. Holden, representing District 30, condemned the move, stating, 'It’s no surprise that businesses will pass the Congestion Scam Tax on to consumers.' Companies like CompuVoip and Dream Events & Decor now add surcharges for customers in the zone. Holden’s criticism joins that of Bronx Councilwoman Kristy Marmorato and others, who warn of higher costs and increased gridlock. Emergency unions claim response times will suffer.

Holden (District 30) publicly criticized Uber and Lyft for their aggressive lobbying around New York City’s congestion pricing plan. The companies spent millions to sway officials, including Governor Hochul and the MTA, aiming to shape the policy to their benefit. The matter centers on new fees: $9 for drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street during peak hours, and a $1.50 surcharge for ride-hail trips. Holden called it 'corporate greed at its worst,' accusing the companies of rewriting rules for profit. Uber and Lyft spokespeople defended their support for congestion pricing but demanded equitable implementation and opposed double taxation of riders.

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.'
