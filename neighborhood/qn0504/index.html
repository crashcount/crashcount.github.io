The record shows “Traffic Control Disregarded.” The bike was “demolished.” The truck’s right front bumper took the hit. CrashID 4807280.</li><li>A 74-year-old man was killed on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Woodhaven Boulevard</a> by a motorcycle going straight.

A pickup truck going straight. The form says the driver was unlicensed. CrashID 4650689.</li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>The dead stack up at <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>80 St</a>: three deaths, 11 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Woodhaven Boulevard</a> is another hotspot.</li><li>Late afternoon is the danger window. At 4 p.m., injuries spike. At 5 p.m., two dead. At 4 and 5 p.m. combined, <strong>five deaths</strong> in this small map since 2022. The city’s sheet shows it hour by hour in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>distribution</a>.</li><li>Heavy vehicles do damage out of scale. Trucks and buses are tied to pedestrian deaths locally; the rollup shows trucks in fatal pedestrian cases in this area, and a box truck is in the cyclist death above. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>vehicle data</a>.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>Council Member Bob Holden backed a bill to yank city placards for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>obscured plates</a>. It aims at the shadow that hides lawbreakers from cameras. The bill sits in committee. He also supported protected bike lanes to the Ridgewood Reservoir, a rare yes that <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/new-protected-bike-lanes-will-connect-to-ridgewood-reservoir>advocates welcomed</a>.</li><li>In Albany, Senator Joe Addabbo voted yes to move a bill that forces repeat violators to install <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>speed limiters</a>. Assembly Member Andrew Hevesi co-sponsors the Assembly version <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>A2299</a>. The point is simple: stop the worst drivers before they kill again.</li></ul><p>The pattern here is not a mystery.</p><ul><li>Since 2022, Middle Village logged <strong>688 crashes</strong>, <strong>443 injuries</strong>, <strong>6 deaths</strong>. In the last 12 months, <strong>4 people died</strong>. This year to date, crashes are up about 11% over last year with <strong>3 deaths</strong> on the board, per the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a>.</li><li>Pedestrians are hit most by SUVs and sedans, but trucks show up in the death column. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>rollup</a> lists SUVs and cars in most injuries; trucks tie to a fatal strike.</li><li>Contributing factors in this area: “other” leads the death count; “vulnerable road user error” also appears. But the forms repeat the same human causes: inattention, failure to yield. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash factors</a>.</li></ul><p>Three fixes. Start now.</p><ul><li>Daylight the corners at 80 St and Juniper, and on Woodhaven. Harden the turns so a truck can’t clip into the crosswalk. Use leading pedestrian intervals. Aim the changes at the 4–6 p.m. peak the data shows.</li><li>Put protected lanes and sidewalk buildouts where the injuries pool — 80 St and along Eliot and Woodhaven. The city is doing this on Cypress Avenue nearby. Holden already backed that <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/new-protected-bike-lanes-will-connect-to-ridgewood-reservoir>plan</a>.</li><li>Target heavy vehicles at repeat hotspots. Enforce for unlicensed driving and plate defacement. The permit-revocation bill for obscured plates is in <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>committee</a>. Move it.</li></ul><p>Citywide levers. Pull them.</p><ul><li>Lower speeds save lives. New Yorkers already pushed for this. Our own call to action lays it out: a citywide <strong>20 mph default</strong> and the Stop Super Speeders Act that forces <strong>intelligent speed assistance</strong> on the worst drivers. Read the plan and act at <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>The worst drivers do the worst harm. Speed limiters passed Senate committees this year with a <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>yes vote</a> from Addabbo. Hevesi signed on in the Assembly. Finish the job.</li></ul><p>A last word from the record.</p><ul><li>“Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way,” Queens DA Melinda Katz said of a Clearview Expressway case that left people badly hurt. Lee told police he entered the highway wrong-way “because I wanted to hurt people and I felt ‘liberated’ by what I had done.” Both quotes are in <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY’s report</a>. Different road. Same city. Same cost.</li></ul><p>One corner here holds three deaths. The curb stayed the same.</p><p>Take one step that matters. Ask your council member and the mayor to lower the speed limit and back speed limiters. Start at <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Primary sponsor: Council Member Lincoln Restler. Co-sponsor: Robert F. Holden. The bill quotes its aim as the “revocation of city‑issued parking permits” for “obscured or defaced license plates.” It would also revoke permits for three misuse violations, any §19‑166 violation, or unpaid violations over $350. Status: Committee. Agenda date: August 14, 2025. Obscured plates block identification and undermine camera enforcement that protects people walking and cycling.

DOT’s report claimed high costs and little safety gain, fueling opposition from Council Members Inna Vernikov, Bob Holden, and Vito Fossella. Council Member Julie Won and Mayor Ravi Bhalla called the report a scare tactic, urging citywide daylighting to save lives. DOT’s compromise with pro-car officials weakens protections. As safety analyst notes, this shift prioritizes cars over people, undermining vulnerable road user safety and citywide mode shift goals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsored by Queens Councilman Robert Holden, the bill sits in the health committee, chaired by Lynn Schulman. Speaker Adrienne Adams has not stated her position. The bill, described as a push to end the city’s carriage industry, gained attention after the death of a horse named Lady. Animal rights groups rallied, warning, 'Without a ban there will be more crashes in traffic, there will be more injuries and possibly deaths.' TWU Local 100 opposes the ban. Safety analysts note that removing carriages would cut unpredictable, slow vehicles from streets, reducing crash risk and making roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
