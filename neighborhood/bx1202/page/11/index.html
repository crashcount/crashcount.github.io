Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie has <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>supported red light camera expansion</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/15/new-york-pols-push-bill-to-cut-vehicle-miles-by-20>bills to cut driving miles</a>, but in the past, he <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>blocked city control over speed limits</a>.

Call your council member. Call your state senator. Tell them: Lower the speed limit. Expand camera enforcement. Require speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p><p>Citywide fixes are necessary. Lower NYC’s default speed limit across the city, and require speed limiters (intelligent speed assistance) for habitual speeders. Those two moves — lower limits plus enforced tech limits for repeat offenders — would turn local pain into a citywide brake on deadly driving.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Committee: State legislature, with final approval by the Capital Program Review Board. The OBTA, created in 2018, collects a taxi surcharge as 'Phase I' of congestion pricing. The first $300 million funded subway repairs; the next $50 million now goes to projects chosen by state legislators and the governor. The bill summary notes, 'A special fund created in 2018 to pay for transportation 'carrots' intended to counteract the supposed stick of congestion pricing finally has a balance of tens of millions of dollars.' Assembly Member Nily Rozic (D-Queens) secured restored Q46 bus service. Lisa Daglian of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA called for a weekly City Ticket. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance demanded better bus service, saying, 'The most important thing is better bus service.'

The bill, which would let New York City control its own speed limits, stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refused to allow a vote, despite majority support. Brooklyn Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, a strong supporter, noted, 'Even [lawmakers] who had City Council members from their districts supporting the bill were still not interested.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.' City data shows a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit reduction.

The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'View Obstructed/Limited' as contributing factors. Both women suffered crush injuries.

The fight continues in Albany.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, a state bill, would let New York City control its own speed limits. The measure stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie blocked a vote, despite support from Governor Hochul, the state Senate, Mayor Adams, and the City Council. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal, who sponsors the bill, rallied outside Heastie’s office, saying, 'Last year, 257 people were killed on New York City streets by reckless and speeding drivers. Each of these deaths was preventable.' Amy Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed in 2013, called for urgent action: 'We can’t wait any longer. People like Sammy, and so many others are dying on our streets.' Advocates point to a 36-percent drop in pedestrian deaths after the city lowered speed limits in 2014. The bill would not set new limits automatically, but would give the city the power to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
