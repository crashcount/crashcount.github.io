The federal action canceled the $9 toll meant to fund the MTA’s capital plan, threatening $16 billion for transit upgrades. The matter drew sharp words: Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, 'The president and the Republican members of New York's congressional delegation ... just blew a $16-billion hole in the most important transit system in the nation.' Subway riders at Canal Street called the move 'insane' and accused Trump of ignoring New Yorkers. Advocates and everyday riders warned that ending congestion pricing would slow commutes, worsen traffic, and put vulnerable road users at greater risk. The city’s future now hangs in the balance, with transit funding gutted and streets set to fill with cars again.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, introduced late Friday, would let Governor Hochul delay a congressional special election until November 4, leaving nearly 800,000 upstate residents without representation. The editorial quotes, 'wiping out congressional representation for so many people for so long is unfair and undemocratic and unconstitutional.' Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key player. Hochul requested the bill be put on hold, pausing the plan. The editorial supports congestion pricing, noting it has 'successfully reduced Midtown and Downtown traffic,' but condemns using democracy as a bargaining chip. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users is assessed, but the piece underscores the importance of congestion pricing for safer, less crowded streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates demand reliable, timely funding.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2025, MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber addressed state legislators, pressing for stable, recurring state funding for the MTA’s 2025-2029 capital plan. The $68-billion plan, approved by the MTA Board, has only $35 billion secured. State leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, rejected the plan’s funding gap, insisting it be resolved in the state budget. Lieber argued, 'the MTA capital budget is totally predictable... no different than Medicaid and education.' He called for the state to treat transit infrastructure as a core, recurring expense. Advocates like Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany echoed this, demanding the state guarantee timely payments and accountability. Governor Hochul and legislative leaders voiced support but offered no concrete solutions. The debate leaves the city’s transit riders waiting for action and exposes them to the risks of delayed repairs and unreliable service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, previously vetoed by Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, now faces deeper uncertainty. Hochul’s budget proposes $3 billion each from the state and city, less than the $4 billion the MTA expected. Hochul stated, "The MTA is developing an updated capital plan to propose to me and the legislature, and once we receive it, we will determine the best way to fund it." Advocates, including Reinvent Albany, called this an abdication of responsibility, warning it puts millions of transit riders at risk.

The sedan was making a left turn westbound when it struck the bicyclist traveling southbound. The bicyclist, a 42-year-old unlicensed male driver, was ejected and sustained injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot. The report cites driver errors including cell phone use (hands-free) and driver inattention or distraction as contributing factors. The bicyclist’s unlicensed status is noted, but no victim fault is indicated. Vehicle damage was minimal, with no damage reported to either vehicle. The collision highlights systemic dangers posed by distracted driving and left-turn maneuvers in mixed traffic environments.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers are left exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On January 15, 2025, Governor Hochul addressed the $33-billion shortfall in the MTA’s 2025-2029 capital plan. The matter, described as a need for a 'concrete blueprint that will deliver actual results,' remains unresolved. Hochul, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins all voiced support but offered no funding solutions. Hochul rejected raising personal taxes and delayed the cap-and-invest program. Heastie pinned hopes on federal aid, while Stewart-Cousins admitted, 'we didn't have an answer.' The MTA is already delaying purchases. No council member or legislator advanced a plan. The gap leaves transit riders—especially those on foot, bike, or bus—at risk as the system’s decline continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers lose again.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the ongoing 2025 state legislative budget negotiations over the MTA’s 2025-29 capital plan and congestion pricing. The article, published January 13, 2025, highlights how Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, and Governor Hochul have failed to deliver needed funding. The matter summary states: 'Starving the MTA will not actually improve service and will not actually improve safety, will not actually improve reliability.' Lawmakers consider exemptions or repeals to congestion pricing, undermining the MTA’s financial foundation. Andrew Rein, a key voice, warns that withholding funds is 'a recipe for disaster and an abdication of responsibility.' The legislature’s inaction threatens subway modernization, safety, and reliability. Without proper investment, vulnerable riders—those who rely on transit—face greater risk and hardship.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The editorial, published by nypost.com, claims, 'Gov. Hochul's State of the State address Tuesday will outline her 2025 legislative priorities, but New Yorkers shouldn't expect them to reflect their own desires.' Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as an opponent of charter school expansion and as a key legislative figure.
