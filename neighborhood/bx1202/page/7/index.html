Introduced March 19, 2024, the bill would require the Department of Transportation to paint and install overhead school safety signs on every street with a school entrance. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing safety signs near schools.' Council Member Susan Zhuang leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Gennaro, Won, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Louis, Cabán, Restler, Farías, Banks, and Riley as co-sponsors. The bill aims to alert drivers to the presence of school-aged children and pedestrians. It remains in committee, with no vote or enactment date set. The measure targets a simple truth: children cross streets, drivers often do not see them. Signs alone will not stop cars, but they mark danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure was left out of the Assembly’s budget, despite support from the State Senate, Governor Hochul, Mayor Adams, and the City Council. The bill’s sponsor, Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal, did not comment. The Assembly’s move angered advocates and families, including Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets, who said, 'We are very disappointed that the Assembly didn’t follow suit.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called the decision a failure to join 'more than 130 unions, hospitals, business leaders, and community-led organizations that recognize the urgent need for this common-sense legislation.' The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.

No safety analysis yet for walkers or riders.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0450-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on February 28, 2024. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to establish a program to allow community centers, schools, arts and cultural institutions and religious institutions to use adjacent outdoor spaces," would force DOT to create a permit program for these groups. Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads as primary sponsor, joined by Stevens, Marmorato, Brooks-Powers, and others. The bill would let institutions apply to use outdoor space for community events. It remains in committee. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to investigate vehicle collisions,' would force the DOT’s crash investigation unit to broaden its definition of serious crashes.
