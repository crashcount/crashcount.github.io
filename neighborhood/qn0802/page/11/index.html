Advocates like Alisa McMorris of Mothers Against Drunk Driving called for stronger messaging: 'We want people to make choices before they leave their home.'

Announced at a December 22, 2022 press conference, the bill has stalled in committee for years. The matter aims to redefine DWI: 'driving while intoxicated would be defined as anything above a blood-alcohol content of 0.05 percent.' Simon and Liu back the measure; city DOT and NYPD leaders joined them. DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' In 2021, 42 people died in drunk driving crashes, up 60 percent from previous years. Officials promise enforcement and education, but their messaging targets drinking, not the act of driving.

No charges were filed against the driver. The intersection, notorious for crashes, lacked a pedestrian signal on the western crosswalk. According to city statistics, Forest Avenue saw 60 crashes and 33 injuries in one year, with three deaths since 2019. Rose Uscianowski of Transportation Alternatives called the killing 'heartbreaking and outrageous,' demanding safe pedestrian and bike access between the Bayonne and Goethals bridges. She said, 'Crossing the street should not be a death sentence.' At least 99 pedestrians have died on city streets this year, making it the second deadliest since Vision Zero began. Forty-two seniors have been killed, three-quarters while walking.
