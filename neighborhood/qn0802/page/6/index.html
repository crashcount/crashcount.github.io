But the blood did not stop. Ninety-eight people were hurt. Two were left with serious injuries. In three and a half years, there have been 335 injuries and five serious injuries in this small corner of Queens. The pain is spread out, but it is relentless. It comes for the young and the old. Five children under 18 were hurt in the last year. Ten people over 65.

On Union Turnpike and 175th Street, a 23-year-old man was hit by a sedan while crossing with the light. He survived, but with a bleeding head. On Jewel Avenue and 164th Street, a 64-year-old woman was hit the same way. She lived. She bled. Both drivers failed to yield. The law says pedestrians have the right of way. The street says otherwise.</p><p>Cyclists are not safe either. On Union Turnpike and 164th Street, a 42-year-old man on a bike collided with an MTA bus. He left the scene with a torn scalp. The bus kept going straight. The cyclist was changing lanes. The road does not forgive mistakes. It does not care who is right.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>No deaths is not victory. It is luck, or the slow grind of fate. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so here. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The council and the mayor have the tools. They have not used them all. The numbers are down, but the risk is not gone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not over. The next crash waits at the next corner. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</p><p>Do not wait for the first death.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill’s summary states, 'The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.' Liu, as the bill’s primary sponsor, emphasized that anyone found with a BAC over 0.05 would be charged with DWI. City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez joined the push, warning, 'Whether they are at 0.06 or 0.12 or 0.20, the consequences can be deadly.' Drunk driving caused 307 deaths in New York State in 2019, nearly a third of all fatal crashes. Utah’s adoption of a 0.05 BAC limit led to a 20% drop in fatal crashes in its first year. The bill is part of a broader effort to protect pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Civilians can report violators. Each offense draws a $175 fine. The city pays whistleblowers a cut. The bill stalled. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0501-2022 was introduced to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on June 2, 2022. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The mayor stays quiet. Speed cameras hang in the balance. Some senators push for 24/7 enforcement. Others hedge. Council members want camera cash for roads. The clock runs out. Streets stay dangerous. Lives hang on the vote.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S5602, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes, would expand New York City’s speed camera program to 24/7 operation. The legislative session nears its end with no clear action. State Sen. Jabari Brisport supports the bill, calling for round-the-clock enforcement. Sen. John Liu backs maintaining cameras but won’t commit to S5602. Some City Council members demand that camera revenue fund local road improvements. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried doubts the Council will send the required home rule message in time, while Assembly Member William Magnarelli promises to advance the bill if they do. Mayor Adams’ team claims safety was discussed in Albany, but the mayor himself stayed silent. The bill faces opposition over increased penalties and insurance notifications. Without action, the city’s speed cameras—and the safety of its streets—are at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
