Twelve serious injuries.</strong> In the last three and a half years, the streets of Upper East Side-Carnegie Hill have not spared the vulnerable. Cyclists, pedestrians, the old, the young. In 959 crashes, 376 people were hurt. Two were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in their bodies.</p><h3 id=the-latest-losses>The Latest Losses</h3><p>On June 18, Salvador Nico Garcia rode his e-bike through Central Park. He collided with a pedestrian in the crosswalk at East Drive and 97th Street. He was thrown from the bike. His head struck the curb. He died at the hospital. The pedestrian walked away with a cut hand. The city counted Garcia as the sixth e-bike rider killed this year. Nico Garcia was <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/man-riding-e-bike-in-nyc-central-park-dies-in-crash-with-pedestrian/>thrown from his electric bike by the impact and slammed his head on the curb</a>.<br>The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is still reviewing the case. A <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>43 year-old Bronx resident died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-cost>Who Bears the Cost</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most pain.</strong> Thirty-two crashes left pedestrians bleeding or broken. Buses and trucks struck two more. Three people were hit by bikes. One by a moped. The numbers are small until you see the faces. A woman crossing with the signal. A cyclist thrown to the pavement. A hand that will never fully heal.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They tout new speed cameras and intersection redesigns. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud. The clock ticks. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No bill number or committee is listed, but the $2-million program stems from a 2023 bill by Council Member Keith Powers. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'The Adams administration is both cracking down on e-bikes and providing safer e-bikes to workers.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'This is not just about protecting delivery workers. It’s about protecting them, their families, their neighbors, and all New Yorkers from deadly fires.' Delivery worker William Medina praised the program, but called for expansion. The program lets workers trade uncertified bikes or illegal mopeds for certified e-bikes, but covers only a fraction of the city’s 80,000 delivery workers. The safety analyst notes: Cracking down may burden vulnerable users, while safer bikes help; mixed signals mean no clear safety gain. The city’s approach leaves vulnerable road users in limbo.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal is not yet a formal bill and has not reached any council committee. Activists and elected officials with experience on 14th Street back the move, citing faster buses and higher ridership. However, the event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no assessment of safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be made.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, to be presented to community boards, would restrict through car traffic between Third and Ninth avenues, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter aims to address congestion and slow bus speeds on the M34, where buses average five to seven miles per hour. Council Member Keith Powers, who rides the route daily, said, "If you dedicate a big chunk of a corridor to bus service, you will see strong results." Powers and community leaders support the move, citing the 14th Street busway’s success: a 24 percent speed boost and 30 percent ridership jump. The proposal follows years of planning and comes as congestion pricing looms. Some advocates remain wary, recalling Mayor Adams’s past delays and reduced busway hours. The city faces pressure to make the busway permanent and effective for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable users watch.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the Adams administration's move to open a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge. The event, not a council bill but a city action, drew sharp criticism from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who opposed removing a vehicle lane for pedestrians and cyclists. The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.' Still, the move restores space to those on foot and bike, challenging car dominance and federal resistance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Dr. Sun echoed distrust, warning the federal government could deprive the city of needed resources. Both candidates supported congestion pricing, with Sun favoring a dynamic model and exemptions for low-income New Yorkers. They called for improved public transit accessibility and more pedestrianization. Powers demanded tougher fare evasion enforcement, while Sun sought nonviolent consequences and better subway quality.

Bill Weber (R-Rockland) opposed the measure, citing toll burdens and limited transit options. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) and Transportation Chair Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester) defended the plan, highlighting increased MTA revenue and minimal impact on local businesses.
