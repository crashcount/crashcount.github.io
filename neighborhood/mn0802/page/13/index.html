Since January 2022, 420 people have been injured and 15 seriously hurt in traffic crashes in Upper East Side-Carnegie Hill. One person is dead. The bodies are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 16-year-old cyclist, cut open in the gut by a passing car. An 81-year-old woman, her head split by an SUV while she tried to cross behind a parked car. The street does not forgive.</p><p>Just last month, eight people were sent to the hospital when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue. The news reported, &ldquo;Eight people were hurt in the crash. All of the injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening,&rdquo; according to <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>ABC7</a>. No word on charges. No word on why. Only the sound of sirens and the scrape of metal.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The old and the young take the brunt. In the last 12 months, 13 people over 75 were hurt. Four children under 18. The street is not safe for anyone, but it is cruelest to those with the least armor. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage—107 injuries to pedestrians from these vehicles alone. Trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds—they all play a part, but the big machines do the worst.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city talks of safety. Council Member Keith Powers backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. Assembly Member Alex Bores pushed for moped registration and better crash data. Senator Liz Krueger voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored a bill for speed limiters on repeat offenders. But the pace is slow. Congestion pricing, a proven way to cut traffic and save lives, was paused. Powers said, &ldquo;[The state] certainly should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>NY Post</a>. The machines sit idle. The danger does not.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>No more waiting. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the city use every tool—speed cameras, street redesign, real enforcement. Every day of delay is another body in the street.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Primary sponsor Jeremy Cooney (District 56) led, joined by Nathalia Fernandez, Monica Martinez, and Shelley Mayer. The measure saw broad support, with senators voting yes across multiple sessions.

Two bills would force companies to provide safe batteries and fireproof charging. FDNY and city officials backed the push. Delivery workers face grave risk. Action is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2023, the City Council held a hearing on e-bike battery safety. The focus: Intro. 949 and Intro. 950. These bills, sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers, would require the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Sanitation, and FDNY to run a buyback program for safe lithium-ion batteries and mandate companies provide fireproof charging containers. The matter title calls on delivery app companies to 'step up' and protect workers from deadly battery fires. Powers declared, 'We're failing as policy makers if we're not protecting folks from that.' Assistant Commissioner Carlos Ortiz and FDNY Code Counsel Julian Bazel testified in support. Both bills have majority Council backing. The Adams administration supports the spirit of the buyback. Delivery workers, mostly low-income immigrants, face high costs for safe batteries and deadly risk from unsafe ones. In 2023 alone, 63 lithium-ion fires caused 52 injuries and five deaths. The Council’s action targets this systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The dump truck had two occupants and was starting in traffic, while the sedan was parked before the collision. The report lists "Other Vehicular" as a contributing factor but does not specify driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding. Both drivers were licensed. The sedan's front center impacted the truck's rear center.

The effort comes as New York City faces a surge in deadly fires caused by uncertified lithium-ion batteries used by delivery workers. The initiative, supported by Mayor Adams and Council Member Keith Powers, aims to get safer, certified batteries into the hands of low-income delivery workers. Powers introduced legislation for a citywide buy-back program, stressing, 'we have to make sure that alongside shutting down the market for unsafe batteries, we remember that there are people affected by this.' Uber will also donate $100,000 to the FDNY Foundation for e-bike safety education. The city’s recent plan to combat battery fires highlights the need for private companies to take responsibility. This partnership marks a rare moment of corporate action to protect vulnerable workers from systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
