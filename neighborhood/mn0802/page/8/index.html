Twelve serious injuries.</strong> In the last three and a half years, the streets of Upper East Side-Carnegie Hill have not spared the vulnerable. Cyclists, pedestrians, the old, the young. In 959 crashes, 376 people were hurt. Two were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in their bodies.</p><h3 id=the-latest-losses>The Latest Losses</h3><p>On June 18, Salvador Nico Garcia rode his e-bike through Central Park. He collided with a pedestrian in the crosswalk at East Drive and 97th Street. He was thrown from the bike. His head struck the curb. He died at the hospital. The pedestrian walked away with a cut hand. The city counted Garcia as the sixth e-bike rider killed this year. Nico Garcia was <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/man-riding-e-bike-in-nyc-central-park-dies-in-crash-with-pedestrian/>thrown from his electric bike by the impact and slammed his head on the curb</a>.<br>The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is still reviewing the case. A <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>43 year-old Bronx resident died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-cost>Who Bears the Cost</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most pain.</strong> Thirty-two crashes left pedestrians bleeding or broken. Buses and trucks struck two more. Three people were hit by bikes. One by a moped. The numbers are small until you see the faces. A woman crossing with the signal. A cyclist thrown to the pavement. A hand that will never fully heal.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They tout new speed cameras and intersection redesigns. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud. The clock ticks. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Gaps in moped regulation remain.</p><p class=mb3>On September 16, 2023, Local Law 39 takes effect in New York City. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) will start enforcing the ban on uncertified lithium-ion battery sales. Inspectors will also check for illegal mopeds, issuing summonses and referring cases to NYPD and FDNY. DCWP spokesperson Michael Lanza said, 'While inspecting retailers for compliance with LL39, we will also check for illegal motorized scooters [mopeds], issue summonses and refer issues to NYPD and FDNY as appropriate.' Two days earlier, the City Council passed Council Member Keith Powers's bill for a citywide battery buyback program, letting delivery workers swap faulty batteries for certified ones. Powers acknowledged the ongoing problem of illegal mopeds, stating, 'We recognize that problem. We've been talking to the deputy mayor's office about further measures ahead.' The new law targets fire risk and unregulated vehicles, but loopholes in moped sales and enforcement persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The main bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, creates a city-funded buy-back program for delivery workers to exchange faulty batteries and devices for safe, certified ones. The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, reviewed by Streetsblog NYC, highlights systemic failures: unsafe streets, lack of charging infrastructure, and tech companies shifting risk onto underpaid delivery workers. Council Member Alexa Aviles urges rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and blames corporate greed. State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle. The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.' Advocacy groups reject punitive crackdowns on workers, pushing instead for expanded bike lanes and public infrastructure. The piece concludes that only a multi-pronged, structural approach—never just enforcement—will protect vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023.

Unsafe e-bike batteries sparked the blaze. Council Member Powers leads a bill to swap out dangerous batteries. Mayor Adams hesitates, citing costs. Delivery workers face risk. The Council demands action. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 949, a City Council bill, seeks to buy back unsafe e-bike batteries and provide safe replacements at low or no cost. The bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, has support from 33 Council members. It follows a deadly Chinatown fire on June 21, 2023, that killed four people. The bill is in committee, with Powers urging Mayor Adams and the FDNY to support it, stating, 'There is a clear consensus that a battery swap program will save lives.' Mayor Adams questioned the program's cost and called for federal, state, and Council funding. FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh backed the need for safe batteries for delivery workers. The Council's push comes as battery fires rise, endangering workers and residents. The bill has broad coalition support, but City Hall has not fully committed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the creation of a mobile application that provides information about electric vehicle charging stations.' Council Member Keith Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Avilés, Cabán, Farías, Riley, Richardson Jordan, Ossé, Ung, Hanif, Restler, and Gutiérrez.

Brad Hoylman-Sigal and other NYC officials lobbied the state legislature to pass key transportation and housing bills before the session ends June 9. The centerpiece is 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let New York City set its own speed limits, potentially lowering them to 20 mph. Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted. Mayor Adams’ administration also pushed for affordable housing reforms. The push for Sammy’s Law is a fight to give NYC control over its streets and protect vulnerable road users from deadly speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
