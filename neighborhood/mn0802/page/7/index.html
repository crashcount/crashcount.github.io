Twelve serious injuries.</strong> In the last three and a half years, the streets of Upper East Side-Carnegie Hill have not spared the vulnerable. Cyclists, pedestrians, the old, the young. In 959 crashes, 376 people were hurt. Two were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in their bodies.</p><h3 id=the-latest-losses>The Latest Losses</h3><p>On June 18, Salvador Nico Garcia rode his e-bike through Central Park. He collided with a pedestrian in the crosswalk at East Drive and 97th Street. He was thrown from the bike. His head struck the curb. He died at the hospital. The pedestrian walked away with a cut hand. The city counted Garcia as the sixth e-bike rider killed this year. Nico Garcia was <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/man-riding-e-bike-in-nyc-central-park-dies-in-crash-with-pedestrian/>thrown from his electric bike by the impact and slammed his head on the curb</a>.<br>The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is still reviewing the case. A <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>43 year-old Bronx resident died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-cost>Who Bears the Cost</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most pain.</strong> Thirty-two crashes left pedestrians bleeding or broken. Buses and trucks struck two more. Three people were hit by bikes. One by a moped. The numbers are small until you see the faces. A woman crossing with the signal. A cyclist thrown to the pavement. A hand that will never fully heal.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They tout new speed cameras and intersection redesigns. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud. The clock ticks. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, has support from 33 Council members. It follows a deadly Chinatown fire on June 21, 2023, that killed four people. The bill is in committee, with Powers urging Mayor Adams and the FDNY to support it, stating, 'There is a clear consensus that a battery swap program will save lives.' Mayor Adams questioned the program's cost and called for federal, state, and Council funding. FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh backed the need for safe batteries for delivery workers. The Council's push comes as battery fires rise, endangering workers and residents.

These bills, sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers, would require the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Sanitation, and FDNY to run a buyback program for safe lithium-ion batteries and mandate companies provide fireproof charging containers.

Assistant Commissioner Carlos Ortiz and FDNY Code Counsel Julian Bazel testified in support. Both bills have majority Council backing. The Adams administration supports the spirit of the buyback. Delivery workers, mostly low-income immigrants, face high costs for safe batteries and deadly risk from unsafe ones. In 2023 alone, 63 lithium-ion fires caused 52 injuries and five deaths.
