But the numbers do not comfort. In the past twelve months, 106 people were hurt in crashes on the Upper East Side-Carnegie Hill. Two were left with serious injuries. The wounds are not just numbers. A cyclist crushed by a truck on Madison Avenue. A pedestrian struck crossing with the signal on East 60th. A woman’s leg broken by a turning SUV. The street does not forgive. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. Sedans and SUVs caused 32 pedestrian injuries, including two serious. Trucks and buses added two more. Motorcycles and mopeds left two people seriously hurt. Bikes were not blameless, but their toll was smaller—three moderate injuries, none serious. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the deeper the wound.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They build new crosswalks, add bike lanes, and lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can set a 20 mph limit. They have not done it yet. Speed cameras work, but Albany lets their authorization hang by a thread. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises pile up, but the street keeps taking its due.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every injury, every broken body, could have been prevented. The city has the tools. The leaders have the power. They need pressure. They need reminders. They need to feel the weight of every name turned into a number.</p><p>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not maim. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
