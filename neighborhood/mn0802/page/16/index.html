Since January 2022, 420 people have been injured and 15 seriously hurt in traffic crashes in Upper East Side-Carnegie Hill. One person is dead. The bodies are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 16-year-old cyclist, cut open in the gut by a passing car. An 81-year-old woman, her head split by an SUV while she tried to cross behind a parked car. The street does not forgive.</p><p>Just last month, eight people were sent to the hospital when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue. The news reported, &ldquo;Eight people were hurt in the crash. All of the injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening,&rdquo; according to <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>ABC7</a>. No word on charges. No word on why. Only the sound of sirens and the scrape of metal.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The old and the young take the brunt. In the last 12 months, 13 people over 75 were hurt. Four children under 18. The street is not safe for anyone, but it is cruelest to those with the least armor. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage—107 injuries to pedestrians from these vehicles alone. Trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds—they all play a part, but the big machines do the worst.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city talks of safety. Council Member Keith Powers backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. Assembly Member Alex Bores pushed for moped registration and better crash data. Senator Liz Krueger voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored a bill for speed limiters on repeat offenders. But the pace is slow. Congestion pricing, a proven way to cut traffic and save lives, was paused. Powers said, &ldquo;[The state] certainly should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>NY Post</a>. The machines sit idle. The danger does not.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>No more waiting. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the city use every tool—speed cameras, street redesign, real enforcement. Every day of delay is another body in the street.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, hosted by State Senator Liz Krueger, featured DOT Manhattan Borough Commissioner Ed Pincar, who said, “We are looking very closely… we may be able to present a proposal maybe even later this year.” The redesign aims to transform Third Avenue into a safer boulevard with fewer car lanes, more bus lanes, a separated bike path, and wider sidewalks. Council Member Gale Brewer and advocates like Paul Krikler have long demanded these changes. Krueger and the NYPD, however, focused on enforcement against cyclists and e-bike riders, citing constituent concerns. Krueger has previously pushed for harsher penalties for electric-vehicle riders. NYPD data shows more enforcement against cyclists than drivers, even though drivers cause most injuries. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Business leaders, including Dan Biederman of the 34th Street Partnership, now support the plan, calling it good for economic development.

The officials want a tangible plan by fall and concrete actions by early 2023. Business leaders, including Dan Biederman, now support the move, citing economic benefits. The recent taxi crash at Broadway and 29th, injuring six, has fueled urgency. The city’s Broadway Vision plan promises pedestrianization from Union Square to Columbus Circle, but advocates and victims’ families demand more, faster.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They say DOT’s plan is weak. They want Broadway for people, not traffic. The push follows blood on the street.</p><p class=mb3>On July 1, 2022, Council Member Keith Powers and Manhattan officials called for the pedestrianization of Broadway in Midtown. The proposal urges the Department of Transportation to close Broadway to most vehicles between 14th and 34th Streets next year, with future expansion to 42nd Street. The matter follows a severe June 20 crash where a taxi hit a cyclist. The politicians’ letter states: 'A safer, more pedestrian-friendly corridor must be achieved quickly.' Powers, along with Mark Levine, Carlina Rivera, and Erik Bottcher, argue the city’s current plan—limited to small plazas and traffic restrictions—is not enough. They demand bold action to protect pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s response: their plans already include many changes, but the council members say it falls short.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
