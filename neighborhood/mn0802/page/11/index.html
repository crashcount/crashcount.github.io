He collided with a pedestrian in the crosswalk at East Drive and 97th Street. He was thrown from the bike. His head struck the curb. He died at the hospital. The pedestrian walked away with a cut hand. The city counted Garcia as the sixth e-bike rider killed this year. Nico Garcia was <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/man-riding-e-bike-in-nyc-central-park-dies-in-crash-with-pedestrian/>thrown from his electric bike by the impact and slammed his head on the curb</a>.<br>The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is still reviewing the case. A <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>43 year-old Bronx resident died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-cost>Who Bears the Cost</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most pain.</strong> Thirty-two crashes left pedestrians bleeding or broken. Buses and trucks struck two more. Three people were hit by bikes. One by a moped. The numbers are small until you see the faces. A woman crossing with the signal. A cyclist thrown to the pavement. A hand that will never fully heal.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They tout new speed cameras and intersection redesigns. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud. The clock ticks. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The move follows a cyclist’s death on E. 85th. Advocates demanded action. The board, once resistant, now shifts toward safety for riders.</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 8 (CB8) voted 38-3 to request 'fully protected crosstown bike lanes approximately every 10 blocks between 60th and 110th streets on both sides of Central Park, and a two-way protected bikeway around Central Park.' The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition. Now, the board calls for comprehensive, protected infrastructure to shield vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city promises action.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2022, Council Member Keith Powers (District 4) joined Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and Council Members Carlina Rivera and Erik Bottcher to urge the Department of Transportation to pedestrianize Broadway from 14th to 34th streets, with plans to extend up to 42nd Street. Their letter cites 429 injuries and four pedestrian deaths along Broadway between August 2011 and May 2022. The officials wrote, 'This stretch of Broadway needs to be made safer, and we believe pedestrianization, with limited necessary entries for vehicles that must access certain points along Broadway, could be a way to positively transform the area and benefit all New Yorkers.' Business leaders, including Dan Biederman of the 34th Street Partnership, now support the plan, calling it good for economic development. The push follows a recent taxi crash at Broadway and 29th Street that injured six. The city’s Broadway Vision plan promises to pedestrianize much of the corridor from Union Square to Columbus Circle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
