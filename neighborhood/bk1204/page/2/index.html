The report states that a 78-year-old male driver, the sole occupant of a 2019 Honda SUV, suffered a severe leg injury after the vehicle was struck hard on the left front. He remained conscious and was found belted in, with blood coming from his leg. The narrative notes, 'No sirens in the data, just blood and a quiet wound.' The vehicle sustained damage to the left front bumper. Police listed the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' providing no further detail on the cause. No other vehicles or road users were involved, and the report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

One driver collected 563 speed-camera tickets in Sheepshead Bay; another, 474 in Manhattan. The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low. The report highlights a small group’s outsized threat and the policy gap that lets them keep driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Notorious NYC road where wacky wigmaker Miriam Yarimi allegedly killed mom, 2 kids has dangerous history,' highlights a grim toll: 20 deaths since 2014, nearly 2,400 injuries since 2012. State Senator Simcha Felder, representing District 44, has opposed lowering the speed limit and even proposed raising it, despite calls from residents and advocates for stronger safety measures. Felder said, 'Some have wasted no time using this tragedy as an opportunity to advance their agenda. There is a time to act but there is also a time to mourn...' Mayor Eric Adams signaled openness to lowering the speed limit to 20 mph. Advocates push for speed cameras and mandatory speed-limiting tech for repeat offenders.

Seabrook had been out on bail for a previous crash involving police. On January 8, 2024, he crashed into a Toyota, killing Hayden Wallace and injuring three others. Seabrook fled the scene, abandoning his vehicle. The article notes, "All accidents are useless but this one was even more useless because [Seabrook] had so many other offenses." Seabrook faces 23 charges, including manslaughter, leaving the scene, unlicensed driving, and speeding. The case highlights repeated driver offenses and questions about bail and enforcement. Police needed over a year to arrest Seabrook, who had a history of fleeing crashes and driving without a license.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
