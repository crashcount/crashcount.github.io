Expansion aims to cut deadly crashes citywide.</p><p class=mb3>On May 31, 2022, the State Senate approved a bill to extend and expand New York City's speed camera program. The measure passed 51-12 and now moves to the Assembly. The bill allows cameras to operate 24/7 in nearly 2,000 locations across 750 school zones until July 1, 2025. The matter summary states, 'The proposal to extend New York City's speed camera program for another three years and expand it to run every day and around the clock easily passed.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored the bill, saying, 'We are going to see a marked reduction in traffic violence on our streets at a time when traffic deaths are at their highest in a decade.' Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams. Some penalties for repeat speeders were removed during negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver fled but was later found and issued multiple summonses, though not arrested. The crash site remained clogged with illegally parked cars, many marked with MTA vests and NYPD placards. These blockages forced buses to detour and left cyclists at risk. The neighborhood has no protected bike lanes. Local officials—State Sen. Simcha Felder, Assembly Member Peter Abbate, and Council Member Kalman Yeger—have opposed street safety improvements. Abbate, quoted as saying, "Bicyclists need to wear a helmet and be registered," supports more enforcement against drivers but resists bike infrastructure. He doubts DOT safety data and calls for stricter punishment for dangerous drivers, yet maintains opposition to measures that protect vulnerable road users. The MTA stated employees are not exempt from parking rules. The street remains unsafe for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is filed, not enacted.</p><p class=mb3>Res 0108-2022 was introduced on April 14, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution urges the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to 'expand and make permanent the Atlantic Ticket pilot in order to include Far Rockaway, and other stations along the LIRR corridor, in the fare affordability program.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Yeger, Stevens, Hanif, Bottcher, Krishnan, and many others. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. The Atlantic Ticket pilot, launched in 2018, gave Southeast Queens and Brooklyn riders cheaper LIRR fares. Advocates say expanding it citywide could mean faster, safer commutes and more transit riders. The council’s action highlights the need for affordable, accessible transit—especially for neighborhoods with long, punishing commutes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to limit the sidewalk area that residential or commercial property owners must maintain to thirty feet from the property line. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to limiting the amount of sidewalk area that private property owners are responsible for maintaining.' Council Members Robert F. Holden (primary sponsor), Kalman Yeger, and Francisco P. Moya backed the bill. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage. The bill would have shifted some sidewalk responsibility away from private owners, but left gaps in accountability. The city retains liability for areas beyond the thirty-foot limit, but the fractured system remains. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, wheelchair users—still face hazards from uneven, neglected sidewalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
