Same ending.</p><ul><li><p>Since 2022, this small area logged <strong>982 crashes</strong>, <strong>5 deaths</strong>, and <strong>617 injuries</strong>. Twelve were serious injuries. The harm falls heavy on people outside cars: <strong>Pedestrians — 2 dead, 136 hurt; cyclists — 84 hurt</strong>. SUVs and sedans did most of the striking. Trucks and buses added their share. The city’s own data shows it all in plain rows and numbers. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p></li><li><p>A 61‑year‑old man died in the crosswalk at Bay Parkway and 60th Street. The SUV went straight. He did not get up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4803841</a></p></li><li><p>On Avenue I at East 5th, a 70‑year‑old crossing at the intersection was hit by a sedan. Police logged distraction. He died. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4825939</a></p></li><li><p>A teenager on a moped was ejected and killed at Avenue N and East 8th. Speed and bad passing were noted. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4822639</a></p></li></ul><p>Heavy hours. Heavy vehicles.</p><ul><li><p>Injury spikes hit the school‑to‑commute band: 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. is a wall — with 52 injuries at 2 p.m., 61 at 3 p.m., 48 at 4 p.m., 45 at 5 p.m. Nights hurt too: deaths logged at 7 p.m., 8 p.m., and 9 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly breakdown</a></p></li><li><p>Pedestrians were most often struck by SUVs and sedans — <strong>2 pedestrian deaths each tied to those body types</strong> in this area’s roll‑up. Trucks and buses caused fewer cases but more severe trauma per hit. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle roll‑up</a></p></li></ul><p>The corners that don’t forgive.</p><ul><li><p><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bay Parkway</a> led the map with 15 injuries and two serious injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Coney Island Avenue</a> saw 44 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue I</a> took a life and 24 injuries.</p></li><li><p>The top listed factors are a shrug that kills: “other,” “vulnerable road user error,” “disregarded traffic control,” and distraction. One driver change that works everywhere is speed. Lower it, and people live. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>local factors</a></p></li></ul><p>Three fixes. Start now.</p><ul><li><p>Daylight the crossings on Bay Parkway and Coney Island Avenue. Harden the turns. Give pedestrians a head start with LPIs. Aim the work at the 2–5 p.m. surge. Tie in truck routing where trucks show up in the injury rolls. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a></p></li><li><p>Target SUVs and delivery fleets at the hotspots. Afternoon enforcement for failure to yield and turning speed. Keep it where the bodies fall.</p></li><li><p>Track repeat offenders by plate. The worst few do the most harm. The state has a live bill to stop them.</p></li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li><p>Albany gave New York City the power to set safer speeds. The city has not used it citywide. A 20 mph default would make the hit survivable more often. Our own call to action lays it out. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p></li><li><p>“A tiny pool of drivers does outsized harm. Just <strong>1.5% of motorists cause 21% of pedestrian deaths</strong>.” Vehicles with <strong>16 camera tickets in 12 months</strong> are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure; <strong>30+ tickets</strong> multiplies the risk fifty‑fold. One driver with <strong>29 camera tickets</strong> ran a red and killed a mother and her two daughters. These are the numbers. These are names turned into numbers. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog NYC</a> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/15/brooklyn-driver-with-29-speed-camera-tickets-kills-mother-and-two-daughters>NY Daily News</a></p></li><li><p>The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> would force repeat speeders to use speed‑limiting tech. Committee votes moved it forward in June. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bill file</a></p></li></ul><p>One neighborhood. Not special.</p><ul><li><p>Year to date, crashes are up here versus last year. <strong>184 this year, 3 dead, 125 injured</strong>, against <strong>168, 1 dead, 108 injured</strong> last year period. The deaths tripled. The streets did not change. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a></p></li><li><p>The map keeps lighting up the same blocks. People keep falling in the same hours. This is policy by neglect. Slow the cars. Stop the repeat speeders. Do it now.</p></li></ul><p>For City Hall and Albany, the path is short and clear: <strong>lower the default speed to 20 mph</strong> and <strong>force chronic violators to obey the limit</strong>. Until then, count the bodies.</p><p>If you want that to change, <strong>act</strong>.

Their son remains hospitalized. The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 21 speeding tickets—15 in school zones—over two years. Lawmakers and advocates called for legislation requiring speed limiter devices on cars of drivers with more than six camera violations. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said the driver 'clearly would've met the threshold.' NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the crash 'a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.' The bill aims to prevent repeat offenders from exceeding speed limits.

The statement came at the funeral for Natasha Saada and her children, killed by a speeding driver on Ocean Parkway. Novakhov argued, 'six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,' and claimed, 'any driver can get much more than six.' He also denounced speed cameras, saying, 'we have too many,' and that they punish regular drivers. The bill’s matter summary centers on requiring devices for vehicles with six violations in a year. Community members and advocates at the funeral demanded stronger accountability and cited the area’s deadly history. Other local politicians, including Kalman Yeger and Simcha Felder, have also opposed speed safety measures. The Department of Transportation has not recommended major changes to Ocean Parkway, despite ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash killed Natasha Saada and her daughters, ages 7 and 5, and left her 4-year-old son in critical condition. Police say Yarimi's car, with over 93 traffic violations and more than $10,000 in fines, collided with another vehicle before plowing into the victims.

The pedestrian was injured in the knee, lower leg, and foot, reporting whiplash and remaining conscious after the collision. The report lists no explicit driver contributing factors, but the collision occurred during the driver's left turn maneuver, indicating a failure to yield to a pedestrian crossing legally. The pedestrian's actions were not cited as contributing factors beyond crossing with the signal. This crash highlights the dangers posed by turning vehicles to pedestrians legally crossing intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the NYPD, 'a man driving a cargo van struck both of them while making a left turn.' Gil died from her injuries; her aide was hospitalized. Police did not arrest or charge the driver. The article notes that Gil was the second elderly pedestrian killed in Brooklyn this year, and cites Transportation Alternatives: '46 senior pedestrians were killed in car crashes across the city last year.' The crash highlights the ongoing risk seniors face on city streets, especially at intersections where turning vehicles endanger those crossing on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
