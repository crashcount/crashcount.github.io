Eight hundred fifty-six injured. Five left with life-changing wounds.</strong> These are not numbers from a war zone. They are the toll of traffic violence in Borough Park since 2022. The dead include children, elders, and parents. The injured are your neighbors. The pain is local, and it does not end.</p><p>SUVs and trucks do most of the killing. Five deaths and sixty-one serious or moderate injuries came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses took another life. Cyclists and moped riders are not spared. The street is a gauntlet, and the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>On March 30, 2025, a mother and her two daughters were crossing 13th Avenue. A speeding Audi, driven by a woman with a suspended license, ran a red light and hit them. Natasha Saada and her girls, ages eight and five, died in the street. Her four-year-old son was left fighting for his life. The driver had a record of tickets and violations. The mayor came to the family and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an irresponsible act by the driver&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/first-photos-of-tragic-nyc-mom-young-daughters-fatally-mowed-down-in-horrific-crash/>New York Post</a>).</p><p>Brooklyn’s district attorney called it more than reckless. &ldquo;It actually exceeds just being reckless, it&rsquo;s almost being wanton, we&rsquo;re not going to tolerate that&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/miriam-yarimi-charged-woman-behind-wheel-brooklyn-crash-killing-appear-court/16118296/>ABC7</a>). But the law let this driver keep driving. The system failed before the crash. It failed after.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about safety.</strong> They praise Vision Zero. They call for lower speed limits and more cameras. But the streets do not change fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Repeat offenders keep driving. Cameras catch them, but the law lets them go.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family at risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the return of the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Demand real consequences for reckless drivers.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in blood. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The vehicle involved was a 2022 SUV traveling westbound, driven by a licensed male driver from New Jersey. The SUV's center front end was the point of impact, causing damage to the vehicle. The report lists the pedestrian's contributing factors as unspecified, and no driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding were explicitly cited.
