Eight hundred fifty-six injured. Five left with life-changing wounds.</strong> These are not numbers from a war zone. They are the toll of traffic violence in Borough Park since 2022. The dead include children, elders, and parents. The injured are your neighbors. The pain is local, and it does not end.</p><p>SUVs and trucks do most of the killing. Five deaths and sixty-one serious or moderate injuries came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses took another life. Cyclists and moped riders are not spared. The street is a gauntlet, and the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>On March 30, 2025, a mother and her two daughters were crossing 13th Avenue. A speeding Audi, driven by a woman with a suspended license, ran a red light and hit them. Natasha Saada and her girls, ages eight and five, died in the street. Her four-year-old son was left fighting for his life. The driver had a record of tickets and violations. The mayor came to the family and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an irresponsible act by the driver&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/first-photos-of-tragic-nyc-mom-young-daughters-fatally-mowed-down-in-horrific-crash/>New York Post</a>).</p><p>Brooklyn’s district attorney called it more than reckless. &ldquo;It actually exceeds just being reckless, it&rsquo;s almost being wanton, we&rsquo;re not going to tolerate that&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/miriam-yarimi-charged-woman-behind-wheel-brooklyn-crash-killing-appear-court/16118296/>ABC7</a>). But the law let this driver keep driving. The system failed before the crash. It failed after.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about safety.</strong> They praise Vision Zero. They call for lower speed limits and more cameras. But the streets do not change fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Repeat offenders keep driving. Cameras catch them, but the law lets them go.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family at risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the return of the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Demand real consequences for reckless drivers.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in blood. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure passed 51-12 and now moves to the Assembly. The bill allows cameras to operate 24/7 in nearly 2,000 locations across 750 school zones until July 1, 2025. The matter summary states, 'The proposal to extend New York City's speed camera program for another three years and expand it to run every day and around the clock easily passed.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored the bill, saying, 'We are going to see a marked reduction in traffic violence on our streets at a time when traffic deaths are at their highest in a decade.' Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams. Some penalties for repeat speeders were removed during negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver fled but was later found and issued multiple summonses, though not arrested. The crash site remained clogged with illegally parked cars, many marked with MTA vests and NYPD placards. These blockages forced buses to detour and left cyclists at risk. The neighborhood has no protected bike lanes. Local officials—State Sen. Simcha Felder, Assembly Member Peter Abbate, and Council Member Kalman Yeger—have opposed street safety improvements. Abbate, quoted as saying, "Bicyclists need to wear a helmet and be registered," supports more enforcement against drivers but resists bike infrastructure. He doubts DOT safety data and calls for stricter punishment for dangerous drivers, yet maintains opposition to measures that protect vulnerable road users. The MTA stated employees are not exempt from parking rules. The street remains unsafe for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to amend the city’s administrative code to increase penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles, including those under and over 10,000 pounds, and for unauthorized horns and claxons. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing certain penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles.' Council Member Sandra Ung sponsored the bill, joined by 26 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. There is no evidence the bill would have improved safety for vulnerable road users. The city’s noise problem, and its threat to livable streets, remains unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to 'prohibit the issuance of multiple bus lane violation tickets for the same infraction within a one hour period.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Narcisse, Ung, Stevens, and Yeger. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The stated purpose was to ensure drivers are not penalized repeatedly for a single bus lane violation. But the bill failed to advance. No changes came for vulnerable road users. Bus riders and pedestrians still face blocked lanes and slow emergency response. The city’s dangerous status quo remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to install reflective material on bollards, curbs, posts, and roundabouts—at least 250 installations per borough, per year. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...requiring the installation of reflective material on bollards, curbs, posts, and roundabouts.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Marjorie Velázquez, Kalman Yeger, Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, and Rita C. Joseph backed the bill. Despite support, the bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided.
