Trucks broke bones and left a pedestrian with a crushed body. SUVs, taxis, bikes, mopeds—all played their part. The street does not forgive. The machines do not care.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, the speed limit can drop to 20 mph. But the limit has not dropped. The council has not acted. The mayor has not acted. The blood dries on the crosswalk while leaders wait.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> Where installed, speeding drops. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them alive. Each year, the clock runs out for someone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone with power. The council can lower the speed limit. The mayor can demand safer streets. Albany can keep the cameras on. They have the tools. They need the will.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand 20 mph. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where children can cross and come home.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation failed to build the 30 miles of protected bike lanes and 20 miles of bus lanes required by law. The agency scaled back busway hours on Jamaica Avenue and 181st Street after local pushback. Council Member Oswald Feliz opposed Fordham Road improvements, calling them an 'existential threat.' Queens Council Member Julie Won labeled Queensboro Bridge delays 'garbage.' The DOT removed protected bike lanes during Fourth Avenue construction, endangering cyclists. The Central Park Conservancy stalled on safety studies. Canal Street and Ocean Parkway saw little progress. The report states: 'city agencies failing to prioritize or deliver on street safety and sustainable transportation commitments.' Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—remain at risk as the city delays, dithers, and disappoints.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced by Councilman Oswald Feliz (District 15) on November 27, 2022. The measure responds to at least 140 e-bike battery fires in 2022, with six deaths and 140 injuries. Feliz said, 'We must ensure that products sold in our city are safe for New Yorkers.' The bill restricts uncertified batteries and supports FDNY’s education campaign. The bulletin warns tenants about the dangers of charging and storing e-bike batteries at home. State Senator Liz Krueger also pushes for tighter battery regulations. The council’s action targets a growing threat to vulnerable residents—delivery workers and tenants—who face deadly fires in their homes and workplaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Appointees Tiffany Raspberry and Menashe Shapiro, both lacking transportation backgrounds, are named as obstacles. Council Members Francisco Moya, Bob Holden, and Oswald Feliz, all Adams allies, have influenced these delays. DOT officials describe a new layer of bureaucracy: 'The threshold for stopping any single project, it’s almost nonexistent.' Projects like Northern Boulevard bus lanes and Fordham Road improvements are on hold. DOT morale is low. The city’s promise of $904 million for street safety is undermined by political interference.
