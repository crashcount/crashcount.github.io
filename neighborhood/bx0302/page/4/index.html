Trucks broke bones and left a pedestrian with a crushed body. SUVs, taxis, bikes, mopeds—all played their part. The street does not forgive. The machines do not care.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, the speed limit can drop to 20 mph. But the limit has not dropped. The council has not acted. The mayor has not acted. The blood dries on the crosswalk while leaders wait.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> Where installed, speeding drops. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them alive. Each year, the clock runs out for someone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone with power. The council can lower the speed limit. The mayor can demand safer streets. Albany can keep the cameras on. They have the tools. They need the will.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand 20 mph. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where children can cross and come home.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the moped 'ran the light' and hit the e-bike, causing the rider to be ejected and land face-first on the pavement. The woman suffered severe lacerations to her face and was conscious but bleeding at the scene. The police report explicitly lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the contributing factor, underscoring the moped driver's failure to obey the signal. The report notes the e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned after the driver’s violation and is not cited as a contributing factor. The crash left blood on the pavement and a rider seriously hurt, all rooted in a driver’s disregard for basic traffic law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The official contributing factor cited is 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper,' highlighting a failure in lane discipline that led to the crash. Both the sedan and taxi were westbound, with the taxi parked at the time of impact. The e-bike rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, but the police report does not list these as contributing factors.

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, defended the current system. Bike-share experts like David Eddington countered that full docks signal popularity, not neglect. Citi Bike General Manager Patrick Knoth explained that point-in-time observations mislead, as ridership is strong and docks are planned based on trends. Citi Bike usage in Stevens's district rose 48 percent from 2022 to 2023, with most riders using reduced fares. The hearing highlighted the need for a comprehensive, accessible bike-share network, especially as e-bikes make hilly areas more reachable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure creates a pilot program to install speed cameras near schools, aiming to catch drivers who exceed posted limits. The authorization for the program expires December 31, 2028. Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push. The vote passed with strong support but faced opposition from several members. The bill’s summary reads: "Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2028."
