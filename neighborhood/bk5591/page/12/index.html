Six seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, that is the cost of moving through Prospect Park by bike, foot, or car. The numbers do not flinch. <strong>194 crashes. 128 injured.</strong> The park is green, but the pavement runs red.</p><p>A 25-year-old woman on a bike died on Parkside Avenue.

In the last three years, bikes caused three pedestrian injuries. SUVs and cars caused five. A moped, one. Trucks, none this time, but the record is not clean.</p><p>The pain is not spread even.

They build bike lanes, lower speed limits, install cameras. But the pace is slow. <strong>One death is too many.</strong> The words are right, but the work is not done. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The law to lower speed limits exists, but the city has not pulled the trigger for 20 mph everywhere.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Call your council member.

The measure raised the payroll mobility tax only for New York City businesses with high payrolls, exempting suburban firms after pushback from their legislators. The Fiscal Policy Institute found this move shifted the tax burden onto Black and Latino workers in the city. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani condemned the policy, saying, 'this illustrates the consequences of fiscal policy that privileges the suburbs over the larger MTA region.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll was one of the few to oppose the exemption. FPI’s Emily Eisner noted, 'there will be a 25-percent decline in the share of white workers impacted by the tax, and a 36-percent increase in the share of Black workers impacted.' Governor Hochul defended the plan as necessary to save the MTA. The bill’s racial and geographic inequity remains stark.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) latest redesign proposal for Ninth Street in Gowanus drew fire at a Community Board 6 meeting. The plan, discussed in the Transportation and Public Safety Committees, adds buffer-protected bike lanes and some jersey barriers, but skips driveways and omits pedestrian islands, raised intersections, and bicycle signals. Maxime Le Munier, whose wife Sarah Schick was killed by a truck driver on Ninth Street, said, “What we want is to guarantee everyone’s safety, and it seems like it’s going to fall short.” Community Board 6 Transportation Chair Doug Gordon and Public Safety Chair Jerry Armer echoed calls for stronger, faster action. Council Member Hanif hosted a recent event on the issue. The committees unanimously approved the DOT proposal with conditions: more pedestrian safety, more traffic calming, and a comprehensive plan for all of Ninth Street. DOT has not set a timeline. Schick’s family is suing the city for $100 million, alleging negligence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed in the Assembly, faces suburban resistance. Carroll’s statement, titled "When It Comes to Transit, Everyone Must Pay Their Fair Share," argues that exempting suburbs would cost the MTA $325 million and undermine regional transit. Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the statement centers on funding the transit system that protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, presented ahead of a Brooklyn Community Board 6 meeting, follows the January death of Citi Bike rider Sarah Schick. The DOT's concept removes parking between Second and Third avenues to create a five-foot, buffer-protected bike lane in each direction. Council Member Shahana Hanif called the protected lane 'imperative' but said, 'getting this bike lane done is the first step towards a more serious look at this corridor.' Transportation Alternatives organizer Kathy Park Price said, 'We did the bare minimum... we can and should do more.' Schick’s widowed husband, Maxime Le Munier, blamed DOT inaction for her death. Advocates and Hanif urge a full corridor redesign, including one-way conversion, but DOT claims this is not feasible now. The plan is only a start.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill on March 23, 2023, proposing a 25-cent surcharge on every online delivery package in New York City. The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city rejected a two-bike-lane alternative, citing pedestrian access needs. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie praised the upgrade, calling Prospect Park a treasure.

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns.
