Six seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, that is the cost of moving through Prospect Park by bike, foot, or car. The numbers do not flinch. <strong>194 crashes. 128 injured.</strong> The park is green, but the pavement runs red.</p><p>A 25-year-old woman on a bike died on Parkside Avenue. A truck, a flatbed, a bike. She was ejected. She did not get up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 17-year-old boy, also on a bike, was struck by an SUV at Park Circle.

In the last three years, bikes caused three pedestrian injuries. SUVs and cars caused five. A moped, one. Trucks, none this time, but the record is not clean.</p><p>The pain is not spread even.

They build bike lanes, lower speed limits, install cameras. But the pace is slow. <strong>One death is too many.</strong> The words are right, but the work is not done. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The law to lower speed limits exists, but the city has not pulled the trigger for 20 mph everywhere.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Call your council member.

The resolution, introduced by Council Members Amanda Farías and Shahana K. Hanif, aims to fund more wheelchair-accessible and all-electric FHVs. The official title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation that would create a surcharge for for-hire vehicles (FHVs) that would go towards funding the expansion of wheelchair accessible and all-electric FHVs.' As of 2022, only 4,858 out of 95,129 FHVs were wheelchair accessible, and just 1% were all-electric. The bill’s backers say the surcharge would help drivers cover the high cost of upgrading vehicles, making city streets more accessible for people with disabilities and the elderly. The measure remains under committee review as of February 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction. The council’s action highlights the ongoing danger children face on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident left Jacob Priley, a cyclist and advocate, critically injured. Hanif highlighted the intersection’s deadly history, referencing the 2021 death of Arcellie Muschamp. She pressed the Department of Transportation for urgent safety upgrades, saying, 'How many more crashes until the DOT pays attention?' Hanif noted the recent completion of a protected bike lane on Ninth Street but stressed that more action is needed. She thanked neighbors for their support and vowed to work with the DOT. So far in 2023, 3,702 cyclists have been injured and 22 killed on New York City streets.

The matter, described as 'DOT continues to ignore dangers it created on Brooklyn’s Fourth Ave,' centers on DOT’s decision to replace bike lanes with a second car lane, violating a city law that requires temporary bike lanes during such work. Council Members Lincoln Restler, Alexa Aviles, Shahana Hanif, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and groups like Bike New York and Transportation Alternatives sent a letter demanding the bike lane’s return and physical barriers to stop illegal parking on pedestrian islands. The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Transportation Committee, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a final report on the program’s effectiveness. The bill required drivers with 15 speed-camera or five red-light tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. Council Member Shahana Hanif voiced disappointment, noting, 'We need to not only reauthorize this program, but strengthen it.' Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data.

Hanif stated, 'We have been proactive and pushing against what this mayor is doing to undo street safety. We need to have the political courage across all levels of government to create a city that is walkable, prioritizes pedestrians, and ends these senseless murders.' Eric McClure of StreetsPAC added, 'Any death is a tragedy and [the] deaths so far this year is a really significant number. We need to do better.' The Adams administration has focused on pedestrian fatality reductions, but activists and council members demand urgent, systemic change as cyclist deaths reach a decades-high peak.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
