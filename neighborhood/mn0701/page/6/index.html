A cyclist, 74, struck by a bus, dies in the street. An 81-year-old woman, thrown from her bike, lands hard on Columbus Avenue. A 31-year-old pedestrian, her head split open, is hit by an SUV at West 64th. These are not numbers. They are neighbors. <strong>In the last twelve months, one person died and five suffered serious injuries on these streets.</strong> Another 133 were hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross, ride, or walk home. The city keeps the tally. The pain is private.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they left dozens with broken bodies. Taxis, buses, bikes, mopeds—all took their share. The numbers are blunt: 35 crashes by cars and SUVs, 4 by bikes, 3 by mopeds, 1 by a truck or bus. No one is safe. Not the child, not the old man, not the woman on her bike. The street does not care.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>City Hall says it wants zero deaths. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. The police promise more enforcement. Cameras watch, but only where the law allows. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit still stands at 25. The council has not acted. The mayor has not signed. <strong>Every day they wait, the risk grows.</strong></p><p>A truck driver hit a man near Central Park, dragged him, and left him in the street. A yellow cab hit him again. The driver was charged with leaving the scene. The victim survived, barely. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/03/truck-driver-charged-in-hit-run-that-critically-injured-man-outside-central-park/>&ldquo;The victim&rsquo;s condition has improved, and he is expected to fully recover while receiving care at a long-term rehabilitation center.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next? Demand Action</h3><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.</strong> It is a choice. A choice to wait. A choice to delay. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill. <strong>Do not wait for another body.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable road users pay.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2024, the New York City Council and Department of Transportation (DOT) faced off over street safety project implementation. The matter, described as a conflict over 'the implementation of street safety improvements, particularly protected bike lanes and bus lanes,' exposes deep rifts. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez asked council members for input; only six of 51 replied. Council Member Gale Brewer cited ignored past outreach. Joe Borelli dismissed bike lanes and DOT’s efforts. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers insisted the agency, not lawmakers, must pick locations. The city is failing to meet legal benchmarks for new lanes. Mayor Adams has sidelined mandates for community feedback. Advocates blame both the council and mayor for delays, missed projects, and rising danger. Decisive leadership is missing. The city’s legal obligations for street safety remain unmet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
