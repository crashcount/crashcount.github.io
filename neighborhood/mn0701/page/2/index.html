Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened.

The bill passed both chambers. Cameras catch drivers who endanger kids. The program ends in 2030. Streets near schools may get safer. The vote was not unanimous.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill S 5677, titled 'Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady,' moved through the Senate and Assembly in June 2025. The Senate passed it on June 12, with primary sponsor James Tedisco (District 44) and co-sponsor Patricia Fahy (District 46) leading the push. The Assembly approved it on June 13. The bill sets up automated speed enforcement near schools and sunsets December 31, 2030. The measure aims to catch speeding drivers near children. Some lawmakers voted no, but most supported the move. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the bill targets a known danger zone for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
