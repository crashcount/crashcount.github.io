A cyclist, 74, struck by a bus, dies in the street. An 81-year-old woman, thrown from her bike, lands hard on Columbus Avenue. A 31-year-old pedestrian, her head split open, is hit by an SUV at West 64th. These are not numbers. They are neighbors. <strong>In the last twelve months, one person died and five suffered serious injuries on these streets.</strong> Another 133 were hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross, ride, or walk home. The city keeps the tally. The pain is private.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they left dozens with broken bodies. Taxis, buses, bikes, mopeds—all took their share. The numbers are blunt: 35 crashes by cars and SUVs, 4 by bikes, 3 by mopeds, 1 by a truck or bus. No one is safe. Not the child, not the old man, not the woman on her bike. The street does not care.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>City Hall says it wants zero deaths. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. The police promise more enforcement. Cameras watch, but only where the law allows. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit still stands at 25. The council has not acted. The mayor has not signed. <strong>Every day they wait, the risk grows.</strong></p><p>A truck driver hit a man near Central Park, dragged him, and left him in the street. A yellow cab hit him again. The driver was charged with leaving the scene. The victim survived, barely. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/03/truck-driver-charged-in-hit-run-that-critically-injured-man-outside-central-park/>&ldquo;The victim&rsquo;s condition has improved, and he is expected to fully recover while receiving care at a long-term rehabilitation center.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next? Demand Action</h3><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.</strong> It is a choice. A choice to wait. A choice to delay. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill. <strong>Do not wait for another body.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection projects a 35% jump in deliveries by 2025, raising safety concerns. The report summary states, 'the number of deliveries made per hour will increase, leading to more delivery workers on city streets.' Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project and Council Member Gale Brewer both called for more protected bike lanes, higher expense rates, and better charging infrastructure. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives said, 'Workers have the right to a safe workplace: for our city's delivery workers, this means a network of safe, protected bike lanes that help prevent crashes.' Advocates insist a wage hike alone is not enough. They demand the city build out infrastructure to protect workers from traffic violence and hazardous conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Gale A. Brewer (District 6) voiced support for a $5 increase to cover work expenses, stating, 'I support increasing the expense rate in the rule by $5 to address these work tools.'

The study, first commissioned in 2018, follows a near-fatal crash between a cyclist and a jogger. The park’s roadways, once for leisure, now see daily conflict among cyclists, pedestrians, horse carriages, and pedicabs. Council Member Gale Brewer reported, 'I get complaints from people, they're no longer using Central Park, they're afraid of getting hit.' Advocates and users cite confusion, poor signage, and unclear lane markings. Suggestions include brighter lines and reducing car space citywide. The Conservancy has not released details on the study’s scope or timeline. Collisions and injuries persist. The park remains dangerous for those outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The mayor returned it unsigned.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0291-2022, now Local Law 115 of 2022, was enacted by the City Council on November 27, 2022. The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
