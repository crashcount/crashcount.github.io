A cyclist, 74, struck by a bus, dies in the street. An 81-year-old woman, thrown from her bike, lands hard on Columbus Avenue. A 31-year-old pedestrian, her head split open, is hit by an SUV at West 64th. These are not numbers. They are neighbors. <strong>In the last twelve months, one person died and five suffered serious injuries on these streets.</strong> Another 133 were hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross, ride, or walk home. The city keeps the tally. The pain is private.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they left dozens with broken bodies. Taxis, buses, bikes, mopeds—all took their share. The numbers are blunt: 35 crashes by cars and SUVs, 4 by bikes, 3 by mopeds, 1 by a truck or bus. No one is safe. Not the child, not the old man, not the woman on her bike. The street does not care.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>City Hall says it wants zero deaths. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. The police promise more enforcement. Cameras watch, but only where the law allows. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit still stands at 25. The council has not acted. The mayor has not signed. <strong>Every day they wait, the risk grows.</strong></p><p>A truck driver hit a man near Central Park, dragged him, and left him in the street. A yellow cab hit him again. The driver was charged with leaving the scene.

The city’s most fragile pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2024, the conflict between the City Council and Department of Transportation over the Streets Master Plan erupted. The DOT failed to meet 2023’s legal benchmarks: just 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes built out of 30 required, and 32 miles of protected bike lanes out of 50 mandated by 2019 law. Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives. More than half of New Yorkers remain far from protected bike lanes as daily cycling surges. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while officials pass the buck.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislation, heard in committee and passed on this date, increases penalties for businesses selling uncertified e-bikes and scooters with dangerous lithium-ion batteries. Brewer said, 'We are not only going after the batteries, we are going after the stores that are selling the batteries.' The FDNY will now assist the Department of Consumer and Worker Protections in enforcement. Fines for repeat violators can reach $2,000. Brewer’s second bill requires e-bike sellers to post safety information in stores and online, with fines up to $350. Councilmember Julie Menin sponsored additional reforms easing street vendor regulations and banning vending in bike lanes. The bills respond to a deadly spike in battery fires—18 killed in 2023, triple the previous year.

Ken Coughlin of CB 7 called the opposition hypocritical, noting the neighborhood’s reliance on delivery workers. Council Member Gale Brewer supports smaller, less invasive infrastructure. The Parks Department plans to proceed, but no timeline is set. Vulnerable road users—delivery workers—remain exposed, with no safe place to rest or recharge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight continues in Albany.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, a state bill, would let New York City control its own speed limits. The measure stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie blocked a vote, despite support from Governor Hochul, the state Senate, Mayor Adams, and the City Council. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal, who sponsors the bill, rallied outside Heastie’s office, saying, 'Last year, 257 people were killed on New York City streets by reckless and speeding drivers. Each of these deaths was preventable.' Amy Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed in 2013, called for urgent action: 'We can’t wait any longer. People like Sammy, and so many others are dying on our streets.' Advocates point to a 36-percent drop in pedestrian deaths after the city lowered speed limits in 2014. The bill would not set new limits automatically, but would give the city the power to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure rejects a total ban. It sets strict limits: only on spans at least 16 feet wide, with 20 feet between sellers. Enforcement remains a challenge.</p><p class=mb3>On December 15, 2023, Council Member Gale Brewer introduced a bill in the New York City Council to regulate street vending on bridges. The bill, debated in committee, would permit vendors only on bridge walkways at least 16 feet wide and require 20 feet between each seller. Bridge approaches would remain off-limits. Brewer stated, 'I believe strongly that a full ban on vendors is not necessary,' and argued for clear, enforceable rules. The Department of Transportation had proposed a total ban on vending across all city-owned bridges, citing overcrowding. Brewer’s bill seeks a middle ground, allowing limited vending while addressing safety and crowding. Vendor advocates welcomed relief from a total ban but warned the spacing rule would be hard to enforce. The bill’s fate remains undecided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
