A cyclist, 74, struck by a bus, dies in the street. An 81-year-old woman, thrown from her bike, lands hard on Columbus Avenue. A 31-year-old pedestrian, her head split open, is hit by an SUV at West 64th. These are not numbers. They are neighbors. <strong>In the last twelve months, one person died and five suffered serious injuries on these streets.</strong> Another 133 were hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross, ride, or walk home. The city keeps the tally. The pain is private.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they left dozens with broken bodies. Taxis, buses, bikes, mopeds—all took their share. The numbers are blunt: 35 crashes by cars and SUVs, 4 by bikes, 3 by mopeds, 1 by a truck or bus. No one is safe. Not the child, not the old man, not the woman on her bike. The street does not care.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>City Hall says it wants zero deaths. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. The police promise more enforcement. Cameras watch, but only where the law allows. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit still stands at 25. The council has not acted. The mayor has not signed. <strong>Every day they wait, the risk grows.</strong></p><p>A truck driver hit a man near Central Park, dragged him, and left him in the street. A yellow cab hit him again. The driver was charged with leaving the scene. The victim survived, barely. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/03/truck-driver-charged-in-hit-run-that-critically-injured-man-outside-central-park/>&ldquo;The victim&rsquo;s condition has improved, and he is expected to fully recover while receiving care at a long-term rehabilitation center.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next? Demand Action</h3><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.</strong> It is a choice. A choice to wait. A choice to delay. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill. <strong>Do not wait for another body.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Officials claim the move will ease crowding and reduce danger for walkers. Vendors, many disabled or veterans, say the ban guts their livelihoods overnight.</p><p class=mb3>On January 2, 2024, City Hall announced a blanket ban on street vendors from city bridges, effective January 3. The policy, not a council bill but a mayoral action, follows months of warnings and public debate. Mayor Adams said, "Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety." The Department of Transportation cited overcrowding and safety risks on the Brooklyn Bridge, where daily pedestrian numbers have doubled since 2021. Vendors and advocates, including Mohamed Attia of the Street Vendor Project, condemned the ban for stripping workers—many disabled or veterans—of income with no safety net. Upper West Side Council Member Gale Brewer proposed a compromise bill to allow regulated vending on wider bridge sections, but the administration pushed ahead with a total ban. The city claims the measure will protect pedestrians, but offers no new space or support for displaced vendors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Each of these deaths was preventable.' Amy Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed in 2013, called for urgent action: 'We can’t wait any longer.

The bill, debated in committee, would permit vendors only on bridge walkways at least 16 feet wide and require 20 feet between each seller. Bridge approaches would remain off-limits. Brewer stated, 'I believe strongly that a full ban on vendors is not necessary,' and argued for clear, enforceable rules. The Department of Transportation had proposed a total ban on vending across all city-owned bridges, citing overcrowding. Brewer’s bill seeks a middle ground, allowing limited vending while addressing safety and crowding. Vendor advocates welcomed relief from a total ban but warned the spacing rule would be hard to enforce.

Critics warn registration means more stops, fewer bikes, and more danger for riders.</p><p class=mb3>On November 13, 2023, Council Member Gale Brewer (D-Upper West Side) publicly opposed Council Member Bob Holden’s proposed e-bike registration bill. The bill, not yet passed, would require every e-bike in New York City to be registered with the Department of Transportation. Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support. Opponents argue the registration bill could suppress e-bike use, increase police stops in communities of color, and worsen traffic violence. Holden dismissed these concerns, insisting his bill is vital for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to block illegal, unregistered mopeds from city streets. Dealers, not riders, would handle paperwork. Advocates say this targets bad actors and protects pedestrians from rogue machines.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2023, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan) introduced a bill in Albany to require moped dealers to register vehicles with the DMV before buyers leave the shop. The bill, supported by Assembly Member Alex Bores (D-Upper East Side), seeks to close a loophole that lets illegal mopeds flood city streets. The matter summary states: 'New legislation in Albany seeks to eliminate the use of illegal mopeds by requiring sellers to register them with the DMV before buyers can take them out of the shop.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This common-sense bill would simply ensure that the registration happens at the point of sale, before someone rides out of the shop.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project backs the move, stressing manufacturer responsibility. Attorney Daniel Flanzig says the law could clear streets of unregistered, dangerous vehicles. The bill is not yet law, but enforcement actions against illegal mopeds are already underway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy.

No change yet for street safety.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1215-2023 was introduced in the City Council on October 5, 2023, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the posting of signs notifying operators of bicycles, bicycles with electric assist, and electric scooters of the prohibition against operating such devices on sidewalks, park walkways, and boardwalks, and of related fines and penalties," would require the Department of Transportation and the Department of Parks and Recreation to post signs warning riders of these restrictions and the consequences. Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Hanif, Brewer, Ung, Abreu, Brooks-Powers, Gutiérrez, and Schulman. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No direct safety analysis was provided. The measure aims for clarity, not infrastructure change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city stalls.</p><p class=mb3>On September 26, 2023, Councilmember Shahana Hanif (District 39) issued a statement following a severe crash at Fifth Avenue and Union Street in Park Slope. The incident left Jacob Priley, a cyclist and advocate, critically injured. Hanif highlighted the intersection’s deadly history, referencing the 2021 death of Arcellie Muschamp. She pressed the Department of Transportation for urgent safety upgrades, saying, 'How many more crashes until the DOT pays attention?' Hanif noted the recent completion of a protected bike lane on Ninth Street but stressed that more action is needed. She thanked neighbors for their support and vowed to work with the DOT. So far in 2023, 3,702 cyclists have been injured and 22 killed on New York City streets. The city’s pace on safety remains too slow for those at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
