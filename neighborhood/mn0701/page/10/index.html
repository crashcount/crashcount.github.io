A cyclist, 74, struck by a bus, dies in the street. An 81-year-old woman, thrown from her bike, lands hard on Columbus Avenue. A 31-year-old pedestrian, her head split open, is hit by an SUV at West 64th. These are not numbers. They are neighbors. <strong>In the last twelve months, one person died and five suffered serious injuries on these streets.</strong> Another 133 were hurt.

The pain is private.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they left dozens with broken bodies. Taxis, buses, bikes, mopeds—all took their share. The numbers are blunt: 35 crashes by cars and SUVs, 4 by bikes, 3 by mopeds, 1 by a truck or bus. No one is safe. Not the child, not the old man, not the woman on her bike.

The police promise more enforcement. Cameras watch, but only where the law allows. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit still stands at 25. The council has not acted. The mayor has not signed. <strong>Every day they wait, the risk grows.</strong></p><p>A truck driver hit a man near Central Park, dragged him, and left him in the street. A yellow cab hit him again.

Sidewalks widen. Intersections clear. Mayor Anne Hidalgo puts pedestrians first. No crackdown on e-bikes. Cars, not cyclists, face the squeeze. Advocates say New York should follow. Fewer cars, more space for people. The numbers demand it.</p><p class=mb3>On June 30, 2023, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced a sweeping policy shift: the new 'Street Code.' The plan, described as giving 'absolute priority for pedestrians,' will remove 70,000 parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, widen sidewalks, and expand bike lanes. Hidalgo rejects harsh measures against e-bikes, focusing instead on reducing car dominance and discouraging SUVs through progressive parking fees. Council Member Gale A. Brewer, District 6, is mentioned in the context of New York’s contrasting approach, where enforcement often targets e-bikes rather than cars. Advocates highlight that cars and trucks cause most pedestrian injuries and deaths. They urge New York to emulate Paris—reclaiming street space from cars, not blaming micromobility. The data is clear: fewer cars mean safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The editorial, titled "With politicians fearful of the TWU, a public referendum is the answer," criticizes the City Council’s failure to act on a bill that would replace horses with electric carriages. Schulman highlights that only 18 of 51 council members sponsor the bill, despite strong public support and past campaign promises. She names Justin Brennan, Gale Brewer, Julie Menin, and herself among those who have not advanced the legislation. Schulman blames union influence for the council’s inaction, citing 115 accidents and 27 horse deaths over decades. She calls for a citizen ballot initiative to bypass political gridlock and protect both horses and the public from ongoing street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The session, led by Council Member Gale Brewer, focused on the matter: 'Charging Ahead? The City Needs Plugs for E-Bikes, Not Cars.' Brewer emphasized, 'I don't hear people calling me up, saying, I need a charging station for my electric car.' Advocates Jackson Chabot and Samir Lavingia argued that curbside EV chargers for cars would 'lock in' car use and block future bike lanes or outdoor dining. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC warned against re-privatizing the curb for car owners. Both Chabot and Lavingia backed Council Member Justin Brannan's bill to require EV-ready parking in garages. Despite city plans, no e-bike charging stations have been installed yet.

Now.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2023, two mothers began a hunger strike at the State Capitol, demanding action on Sammy’s Law. The bill, first introduced in 2020 by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and carried in the Assembly by Linda Rosenthal, would let New York City set speed limits below 25 mph. The City Council backed the measure with a 'home rule' message last month. But Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie has not brought it to a vote. The matter title: 'Sammy’s Law.' Amy Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed in 2013, and Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, whose son Bryan was killed in 2006, lead the protest. Mendieta-Cuapio says, 'We need to pass Sammy's Law today, no more excuses.' Lawmakers hide behind closed doors. The mothers refuse to let their children’s deaths be ignored.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Jen Gutierrez called the refusal to vote 'unbelievable,' saying, 'Families across the city deserve this vote.' Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother, called the inaction 'unconscionable.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said the bill lacks support to reach the floor. The bill passed the City Council’s home rule message but faces Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie’s resistance.
