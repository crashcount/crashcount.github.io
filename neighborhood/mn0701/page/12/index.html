A cyclist, 74, struck by a bus, dies in the street. An 81-year-old woman, thrown from her bike, lands hard on Columbus Avenue. A 31-year-old pedestrian, her head split open, is hit by an SUV at West 64th. These are not numbers. They are neighbors. <strong>In the last twelve months, one person died and five suffered serious injuries on these streets.</strong> Another 133 were hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross, ride, or walk home. The city keeps the tally. The pain is private.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they left dozens with broken bodies. Taxis, buses, bikes, mopeds—all took their share. The numbers are blunt: 35 crashes by cars and SUVs, 4 by bikes, 3 by mopeds, 1 by a truck or bus. No one is safe. Not the child, not the old man, not the woman on her bike. The street does not care.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>City Hall says it wants zero deaths. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime. The police promise more enforcement. Cameras watch, but only where the law allows. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit still stands at 25. The council has not acted. The mayor has not signed. <strong>Every day they wait, the risk grows.</strong></p><p>A truck driver hit a man near Central Park, dragged him, and left him in the street. A yellow cab hit him again. The driver was charged with leaving the scene. The victim survived, barely. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/03/truck-driver-charged-in-hit-run-that-critically-injured-man-outside-central-park/>&ldquo;The victim&rsquo;s condition has improved, and he is expected to fully recover while receiving care at a long-term rehabilitation center.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next? Demand Action</h3><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.</strong> It is a choice. A choice to wait. A choice to delay. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill. <strong>Do not wait for another body.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

In a letter, Hoylman-Sigal wrote, "We urge you to create a unified payment system as expeditiously as possible." The proposal aims to remove barriers for would-be Citi Bike users and address issues like vandalized QR codes. The bill is a policy proposal, not yet in committee or up for a vote. Hoylman-Sigal’s push highlights the fractured nature of New York’s fare systems, with separate payments for subways, bikes, ferries, and regional trains. While OMNY integration could streamline access, technical and financial hurdles remain. The MTA and Cubic, OMNY’s contractor, say they are reviewing expansion opportunities.

The bill, first introduced in 2020 by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and carried in the Assembly by Linda Rosenthal, would let New York City set speed limits below 25 mph. The City Council backed the measure with a 'home rule' message last month. But Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie has not brought it to a vote. The matter title: 'Sammy’s Law.' Amy Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed in 2013, and Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, whose son Bryan was killed in 2006, lead the protest. Mendieta-Cuapio says, 'We need to pass Sammy's Law today, no more excuses.' Lawmakers hide behind closed doors.

Brad Hoylman-Sigal and other NYC officials lobbied the state legislature to pass key transportation and housing bills before the session ends June 9. The centerpiece is 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let New York City set its own speed limits, potentially lowering them to 20 mph. Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted. Mayor Adams’ administration also pushed for affordable housing reforms. The push for Sammy’s Law is a fight to give NYC control over its streets and protect vulnerable road users from deadly speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, led by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, is a required step before state passage. Brooks-Powers had withheld support until the bill included street redesigns for safety, especially in low-income communities of color. She said, 'Lowering speed limits works best when paired with traffic calming and street safety infrastructure.' The resolution now has 23 co-sponsors, three short of a majority. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver. Last year, the Council failed to pass a home rule message under Speaker Adams.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
