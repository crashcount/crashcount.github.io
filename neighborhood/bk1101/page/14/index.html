Eleven left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In three years, Bensonhurst’s streets have not grown safer. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,637 crashes</strong> since 2022. <strong>899 people hurt.</strong> The youngest, a child. The oldest, a grandparent. Most never make the news. Their pain is private, but the violence is public.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> In the last twelve months, 286 people were injured here. Five were left with life-changing wounds. Not one death, but the luck will not hold. Children, adults, elders—all struck, all counted. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> Two killed by SUVs. One by a bike. One by a moped. Trucks, sedans, e-bikes—they all take their share. The street does not care who you are. It only matters who is bigger, who is faster, who is protected by steel.</p><p><strong>Crashes come in waves.</strong> A cyclist crushed on 62nd Street. A pedestrian struck crossing with the light. A moped rider ejected, never to get up again. The details change. The outcome does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders day and night. But in Bensonhurst, the silence is thick. No bold new redesigns. No flood of protected bike lanes. No public fight for the vulnerable. <strong>Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are the result of choices. Choices made by those in power, and by those who stay quiet. <strong>If you want safer streets, you must demand them.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the DOT. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On February 16, 2023, Council Member Alexa Aviles introduced three bills in the New York City Council to address the unchecked growth of last-mile delivery facilities. The bills, not yet passed or assigned a committee, require the city to study truck and delivery traffic, explore street design changes to limit commercial vehicles in residential areas, and consider maritime shipping alternatives. The matter summary states: 'Pols and advocates are demanding that New York City crack down on last-mile distribution facilities, which are proliferating in low-income communities of color and bringing increased truck traffic, emissions, and dangerous streets.' Aviles, joined by other council members and community advocates, criticized the city’s inaction and highlighted the toll on neighborhoods: delayed traffic studies, rising fatalities, and environmental harm. The coalition calls for a special permit process and zoning reforms to protect vulnerable residents from truck-related danger and pollution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the council, seeks to amend zoning laws to require special permits for new facilities. The measure aims to stop warehouse clustering near schools, parks, and homes, and mandates studies on truck traffic and air quality. The proposal, described as a response to 'an epidemic of truck traffic,' targets companies like Amazon whose rapid delivery model floods streets with trucks. Avilés declared, 'This is environmental racism. Last-mile facilities follow the same pattern, dumping environmental burdens on low-income communities of color.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez joined, demanding companies 'be responsible, take our communities into account so that we can breathe cleaner air.' The Adams administration expressed concern about economic impacts but supports electrification and cargo bike incentives. The bill awaits committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous.

She demanded real engagement, language access, and urgent safety fixes. Aviles wants pedestrian lives put before business parking and empty promises.</p><p class=mb3>On December 5, 2022, Council Member Alexa Aviles issued a public statement on the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) redesign plan for Seventh and Eighth avenues in Sunset Park. The DOT’s proposal, which included one-way conversions, protected bike lanes, and expanded sidewalks, stalled after business opposition and a lawsuit. Following a crash that injured two young girls, DOT revived the plan but removed the Eighth Avenue bike lane. Aviles criticized DOT’s outreach, saying, 'the city could do better' and called for 'robust, accessible community engagement,' especially for Chinese-speaking residents. She urged DOT to finish promised safety work, prioritize pedestrian safety over business interests, and not rush the process. Aviles supported curb extensions, traffic calming, and one-way conversions if paired with real safety measures. She demanded urgent, compassionate action to protect vulnerable road users and insisted that community voices—not business parking—must guide street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
