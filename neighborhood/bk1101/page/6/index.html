Eleven left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In three years, Bensonhurst’s streets have not grown safer. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,637 crashes</strong> since 2022. <strong>899 people hurt.</strong> The youngest, a child. The oldest, a grandparent. Most never make the news. Their pain is private, but the violence is public.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> In the last twelve months, 286 people were injured here. Five were left with life-changing wounds. Not one death, but the luck will not hold. Children, adults, elders—all struck, all counted. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> Two killed by SUVs. One by a bike. One by a moped. Trucks, sedans, e-bikes—they all take their share. The street does not care who you are. It only matters who is bigger, who is faster, who is protected by steel.</p><p><strong>Crashes come in waves.</strong> A cyclist crushed on 62nd Street. A pedestrian struck crossing with the light. A moped rider ejected, never to get up again. The details change. The outcome does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders day and night. But in Bensonhurst, the silence is thick. No bold new redesigns. No flood of protected bike lanes. No public fight for the vulnerable. <strong>Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are the result of choices. Choices made by those in power, and by those who stay quiet. <strong>If you want safer streets, you must demand them.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the DOT. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras.

Council Member Alexa Avilés sponsored the bill, citing freight traffic’s toll on her district. The law’s summary: DOT must report on redesign, using over 2,000 public comments. Many comments—36 percent—flagged dangerous conflicts between trucks, pedestrians, and cyclists. DOT missed the deadline, blaming an extended comment period. Elizabeth Yeampierre (UPROSE) demanded fewer trucks on residential streets and routes away from schools and parks. Maria Fernanda Pulido-Velosa (El Puente) called for real engagement and clear communication if delays continue. DOT now promises more outreach and a microhubs pilot for last-mile deliveries.

The bill, led by Council Member Alexa Avilés, responds to a surge in residential development and e-commerce, which has brought more trucks into neighborhoods like Red Hook and Sunset Park. The DOT’s public feedback map drew over 2,000 comments, with 36 percent citing conflicts between trucks and pedestrians or cyclists. Avilés said, 'I was delighted that DOT could easily acknowledge that this was something we needed to address and was way overdue,' but criticized the city’s 'very passive' engagement. Advocates and residents demand more than online surveys. Environmental justice communities—Hunts Point, Red Hook, Maspeth—face the worst pollution and danger. The city is testing microhubs, off-hour deliveries, and 'Blue Highways' to shift freight off the streets. The redesign aims to cut truck traffic and protect people outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
