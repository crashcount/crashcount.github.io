Eleven left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In three years, Bensonhurst’s streets have not grown safer. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,637 crashes</strong> since 2022. <strong>899 people hurt.</strong> The youngest, a child. The oldest, a grandparent. Most never make the news. Their pain is private, but the violence is public.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> In the last twelve months, 286 people were injured here. Five were left with life-changing wounds. Not one death, but the luck will not hold. Children, adults, elders—all struck, all counted. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> Two killed by SUVs. One by a bike. One by a moped. Trucks, sedans, e-bikes—they all take their share. The street does not care who you are. It only matters who is bigger, who is faster, who is protected by steel.</p><p><strong>Crashes come in waves.</strong> A cyclist crushed on 62nd Street. A pedestrian struck crossing with the light. A moped rider ejected, never to get up again. The details change. The outcome does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders day and night. But in Bensonhurst, the silence is thick. No bold new redesigns. No flood of protected bike lanes. No public fight for the vulnerable. <strong>Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are the result of choices. Choices made by those in power, and by those who stay quiet. <strong>If you want safer streets, you must demand them.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the DOT. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets built for people, not just cars.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers. Assembly Member Grace Lee said, 'They should be exempt from tolls under the congestion pricing plan.' The MTA has not taken a position on the exemption.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT offered no timeline. The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On September 6, 2023, advocates confronted the Department of Transportation (DOT) at a rules hearing over a city proposal to ban parking at curb cuts in T-shaped intersections. The proposal aims to close a 2009 loophole that lets drivers park in crosswalks at three-way junctions if unmarked or lacking signals. The matter summary reads: 'A city proposal to ban parking at curbs cuts in "T" intersections must go further by banning all parking at the edges of such intersections, advocates demanded.' Christine Serdjenian Yearwood, Jean Ryan, Rosamond Gianutsos, and Jackson Chabot spoke out, demanding a total ban and daylighting at all intersections. Advocates argue that parking at T intersections blocks visibility and endangers pedestrians, especially the disabled and children. DOT supports the rule change but gave no timeline. The city still overrides state law requiring 20 feet of clear space at crosswalks. The fight for safety continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
