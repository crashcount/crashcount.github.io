Eleven left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In three years, Bensonhurst’s streets have not grown safer. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,637 crashes</strong> since 2022. <strong>899 people hurt.</strong> The youngest, a child. The oldest, a grandparent. Most never make the news. Their pain is private, but the violence is public.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> In the last twelve months, 286 people were injured here. Five were left with life-changing wounds. Not one death, but the luck will not hold. Children, adults, elders—all struck, all counted. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> Two killed by SUVs. One by a bike. One by a moped. Trucks, sedans, e-bikes—they all take their share. The street does not care who you are. It only matters who is bigger, who is faster, who is protected by steel.</p><p><strong>Crashes come in waves.</strong> A cyclist crushed on 62nd Street. A pedestrian struck crossing with the light. A moped rider ejected, never to get up again. The details change. The outcome does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders day and night. But in Bensonhurst, the silence is thick. No bold new redesigns. No flood of protected bike lanes. No public fight for the vulnerable. <strong>Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are the result of choices. Choices made by those in power, and by those who stay quiet. <strong>If you want safer streets, you must demand them.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the DOT. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets built for people, not just cars.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
