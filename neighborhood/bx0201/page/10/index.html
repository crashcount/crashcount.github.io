Target enforcement at night when the injuries spike. Focus on trucks where they mix with people on foot — this neighborhood sees them every day. These steps match the harms in the logs here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Citywide, the state has a bill to stop the worst repeat speeders. In Albany, the Senate’s <strong>S 4045</strong> advanced with local Senator <strong>Jose Serrano</strong> listed as a co-sponsor and a “yes” vote in committee (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). In the Assembly, <strong>Amanda Septimo</strong> co-sponsors the matching <strong>A 2299</strong> (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States</a>). These bills would require intelligent speed limiters for drivers with repeat violations, a direct curb on the small group that does outsize harm.</p><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city has the tools to drop speeds and redesign its worst corridors. The pressure comes from you.

The clock ticks.</p><p class=mb3>On September 13, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on the Department of Transportation’s leadership and street safety in the Bronx. Council Member Rafael Salamanca (D-Concourse Village) pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, stating, "There is no borough commissioner in the borough of the Bronx." The Bronx has lacked a permanent commissioner since November 2021. Salamanca demanded a timeline for filling the role, arguing, "There needs to be a level of accountability and our level of accountability is reaching out to that borough commissioner. Please speed it up." DOT responded that street safety projects are not planned or implemented by borough commissioners, but Salamanca insisted the vacancy leaves the Bronx exposed as crashes and injuries rise. All other boroughs have commissioners. The Bronx waits for leadership as danger mounts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
