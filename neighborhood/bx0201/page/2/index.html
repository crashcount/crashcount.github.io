Most were on foot or in cars. Some were children. Some were old. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>Just days ago, a driver ran a red light at Hunts Point Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard. His car jumped the curb. Three men on the sidewalk were hit. One is still fighting for his life. The driver ran but did not get far. Police charged him with vehicular assault and reckless endangerment. &ldquo;Jenkins&rsquo; vehicle struck three pedestrians on the sidewalk, then hit a Chevy Equinox,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-hunts-point-pedestrians-struck/>police said</a>. The street was left marked by blood and broken glass.</p><p>This is not rare. In April, a box truck killed a 61-year-old man on Oak Point Avenue. Last summer, a 29-year-old cyclist was crushed by a turning dump truck on Barry Street. The dead do not speak. Their absence is the only proof left.</p><h3 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h3><p><strong>Most injuries to pedestrians here come from cars, SUVs, and trucks.</strong> In three years, these vehicles killed two and hurt over 80 more. Not one death came from a bike or moped (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Rafael Salamanca, Jr. co-sponsored bills to fix NYCHA sidewalks and tow unregistered vehicles—measures that could help. He also <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, erasing a law used to blame the dead instead of the driver. But too often, action is slow. Bills to tow unregistered cars and target fake plates have stalled. The streets wait.

The law caught up, but not before the car did.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Ask for lower speed limits, protected crossings, and real enforcement. Do not let another name become a number. The dead cannot wait.

Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz stated, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz highlighted the broader issue: "We’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced." The incident underscores the risks posed by illegal parking and the need for stricter enforcement and infrastructure checks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced January 17, 2025, it awaits committee review. The bill summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, and others. No votes have been recorded yet. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving by forcing speed limiters on offenders.

Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage.
