Police recorded <strong>1,100 injuries</strong> in that same window (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

Around <strong>9 PM</strong>, this area logged <strong>102 injuries</strong> and <strong>4 serious injuries</strong> — the worst single hour on the clock (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Trucks add weight to the risk; this period includes at least <strong>one pedestrian death</strong> involving a truck and more injuries tied to heavy vehicles (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Failure to yield and distraction show up again and again in crash reports here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Across Hunts Point, Bruckner corridors rack up bodies and broken bones. On <strong>Bruckner Boulevard</strong>, police logged <strong>271 injuries</strong>. Nearby entries list <strong>Bruckner Blvd</strong> again with <strong>2 deaths</strong> and <strong>79 injuries</strong>. The expressway adds <strong>96 injuries</strong> and <strong>2 serious injuries</strong> to the toll (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The same names, the same harm.</p><p>In 2023, as the Bronx waited for leadership, Council Member Rafael Salamanca said it plain: “There is no borough commissioner in the borough of the Bronx… Please speed it up” (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/13/amid-rash-of-crashes-theres-no-bronx-borough-commissioner-for-dot>Streetsblog NYC</a>).

The woman killed at Leggett and Bruckner was identified as Dilmania Lopez de Rodriguez. Police say she was in the crosswalk when a northbound driver struck her and fled (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-hit-run-kills-32-year-old-pedestrian-longwood-section/17650960/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/26/us-news/woman-32-fatally-struck-by-hit-and-run-driver-while-crossing-nyc-street-cops/>New York Post</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/30/bronx-mother-fatally-struck-hit-run-crosswalk/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>This is not the first time the Bruckner spine shows up in the logs.

They include <strong>9 deaths</strong> and <strong>14 serious injuries</strong> across modes. Pedestrians alone suffered <strong>39 recorded cases</strong> from SUVs, <strong>30</strong> from sedans, and <strong>15</strong> from trucks; at least <strong>one</strong> of those truck cases was fatal (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The <strong>9 PM</strong> hour hits hard here, followed by steady harm late into the night and after midnight. Reports list named factors like failure to yield and driver distraction among the causes pinned to local crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>—</p><h3 id=the-fixes-are-on-paper>The fixes are on paper</h3><p>Basic street moves fit the pattern at Bruckner and Leggett: daylight every corner, give longer lead-walk time, harden turns, and tame truck turns on the northbound approach. Target enforcement at night when the injuries spike. Focus on trucks where they mix with people on foot — this neighborhood sees them every day. These steps match the harms in the logs here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Citywide, the state has a bill to stop the worst repeat speeders. In Albany, the Senate’s <strong>S 4045</strong> advanced with local Senator <strong>Jose Serrano</strong> listed as a co-sponsor and a “yes” vote in committee (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). In the Assembly, <strong>Amanda Septimo</strong> co-sponsors the matching <strong>A 2299</strong> (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States</a>). These bills would require intelligent speed limiters for drivers with repeat violations, a direct curb on the small group that does outsize harm.</p><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city has the tools to drop speeds and redesign its worst corridors. The pressure comes from you. Start here: <strong><a href=/take_action/>Take action</a></strong>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

Two sedans collided in the dark. One ran the light. A 21-year-old woman in the front seat died, her body broken in silence. The parked box truck watched, untouched, useless.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, two sedans collided near Manida Street and Viele Avenue in the Bronx at 2:40 a.m. The report states that 'one ran the light.' The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded.' This means a driver ignored a traffic signal, a critical error that led to the crash. The impact was severe: a 21-year-old woman, riding as a front passenger, was killed. Her injuries were described as affecting her entire body, and she was pronounced dead at the scene. The report notes a parked box truck was present but was not involved in the collision. No driver or vehicle errors are attributed to the victim. The fatal outcome stemmed from a driver’s failure to obey traffic controls, as documented by police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
