Three left with injuries that will never fully heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, Hunts Point saw 466 crashes. <strong>Two people died. Three were seriously hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are bodies in the street, families waiting at hospital doors.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 61-year-old man was crushed by a box truck on Oak Point Avenue. He died where he stood. A year before, a 29-year-old cyclist was killed by a dump truck turning right on Tiffany Street. No helmet, no right of way, no chance. The street did not forgive him.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> In this period, SUVs and sedans caused the most pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks followed close behind. Not a single death from a bicycle. The violence is not random. It is heavy, fast, and always moving forward.</p><p>The pain is not spread evenly. <strong>Children, the elderly, the young—all are hit.</strong> In the last year, 11 children were hurt. One person aged 18–24 died. Another in their late fifties. The old and the young, both broken by speed and steel.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> Assembly Member Amanda Septimo co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech in their cars (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>). State Senator Jose Serrano voted yes on a similar bill in the Senate (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a>). Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. has called for more accountability from DOT and supported crackdowns on fake plates (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/13/amid-rash-of-crashes-theres-no-bronx-borough-commissioner-for-dot>supported crackdowns</a>). But the streets remain the same. The trucks keep rolling. The bodies keep falling.</p><p>A witness once <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>described the aftermath</a>: &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out.&rdquo; The words are plain. The horror is not.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without change is another day someone does not come home. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real redesigns. Demand that repeat speeders lose their keys. <strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
