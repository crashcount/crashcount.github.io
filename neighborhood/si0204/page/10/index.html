Three people have died here since 2022. Six more were left with injuries so serious they may never walk the same. In the last twelve months alone, 474 crashes tore through these streets. 307 neighbors were hurt. Five were seriously injured.</p><p>The bodies are not numbers. A worker crushed by a reversing truck. A cyclist thrown by a sedan. A child, a parent, a friend—gone or changed forever. The road is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price-the-most-vulnerable>Who Pays the Price? The Most Vulnerable</h3><p>Trucks killed two pedestrians. Cars and SUVs left dozens more with broken bones and broken lives. The data is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the deeper the scar. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans caused 73 pedestrian injuries. Trucks and buses killed two and injured nine more. Bikes caused one moderate injury. No one is safe, but those outside the steel cage pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-cast-lives-at-stake>Leadership: Votes Cast, Lives at Stake</h3><p>When the chance came to make streets safer, local leaders blinked. Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo and State Senator Andrew Lanza both voted against reauthorizing the city’s school zone speed camera program—a proven tool that saves lives. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC named them among the &ldquo;Dirty Dozen&rdquo; who stood in the way</a>. Lanza also voted no on bills to create safer school speed zones for children. The silence is loud. The inaction is deadly.</p><p>No quote from a grieving family can soften this. But the words of a city official ring out: &ldquo;Speeding ruins lives, and reducing vehicle speeds by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/sammys-law-enactment.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSpeeding%20ruins%20lives%2C%20and%20reducing,keep%20everyone%20safe%20on%20our">said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>.</p><h3 id=what-now-the-road-ahead>What Now? The Road Ahead</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. The tools exist: lower speed limits, more speed cameras, street redesigns that put people before cars. But tools unused are as useless as promises unkept.</p><p>Call your council member. Call your state reps. Demand action. Tell them the numbers are not enough. The bodies are not enough. The silence is not enough.

The MTA defends the plan, saying it funds safer, less crowded streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 4, 2024, Council Member Joseph C. Borelli (District 51) joined seventeen other lawmakers in a federal lawsuit to block New York City’s $15 congestion pricing toll for Midtown Manhattan. The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation.
