Two left with injuries that may never heal.</strong> In Crown Heights (South), the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have killed five people and left hundreds more hurt. In the last year alone, 190 people were injured on these streets. Two were hurt so badly they may never walk the same again. One was a woman, 101 years old, crossing with the light. She was struck by an unlicensed driver in a hulking SUV. She died twelve days later. Her son called it a &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>in the Daily News</a>. Her grandson said, &ldquo;She was extremely independent till her last day&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/24/us-news/hasidic-family-matriarch-who-fled-russia-after-world-war-ii-fatally-struck-by-unlicensed-driver-in-nyc-independent-till-her-last-day/>in the New York Post</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-unlicensed-unchecked-unchanged>The Pattern: Unlicensed, Unchecked, Unchanged</h3><p><strong>Unlicensed drivers keep killing.</strong> The man behind the wheel that night had no license. He was charged and released. The street did not change. The city did not change. The next week, another unlicensed driver killed a mother and her two daughters in Brooklyn. The pattern is clear. The pain is fresh. The system shrugs.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to act.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. No new redesigns or safety measures have been announced for these deadly intersections. No bold statements from the council or community board. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to redesign the crossings where people die. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brooks-Powers (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, Tiffany Cabán, Crystal Hudson, Kevin C. Riley, and Lynn C. Schulman sponsored the measure.

The council filed the bill at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided.

The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens.

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.

The cars are gone now, but the damage lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On January 29, 2023, NYPD officers from the 88th Precinct parked their personal vehicles in Classon Playground, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. The move blocked public access to recreation space. Council Member Crystal Hudson responded, stating, 'We believe this was done in anticipation of potential protests, though it’s hard to understand the correlation.' She pledged to contact both the 88th Precinct and the Parks Department about this recurring practice. The NYPD later claimed the parking was temporary, meant to protect vehicles from possible vandalism. Local parents expressed anger at losing playground space. No council bill was filed, but the incident highlights how police actions can strip vulnerable road users—children and families—of safe public space.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install bollards at reconstructed sidewalks, curb extensions, and pedestrian ramps, especially where accessibility upgrades are made. It mandates a study on bollard effectiveness in high pedestrian areas and demands annual reporting on installations and requests. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no enactment. The measure aims to harden pedestrian space, forcing the city to act where cars threaten walkers and wheelchair users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
