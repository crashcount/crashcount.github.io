The poll, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found deep worry among women, seniors, and Bronx residents. The matter summary reads: '77% of NYC voters consider pedestrian safety a serious issue.' Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death. The poll signals a mandate: fix the streets, protect the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
