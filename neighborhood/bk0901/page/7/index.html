Two left with injuries that may never heal.</strong> In Crown Heights (South), the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have killed five people and left hundreds more hurt. In the last year alone, 190 people were injured on these streets. Two were hurt so badly they may never walk the same again. One was a woman, 101 years old, crossing with the light. She was struck by an unlicensed driver in a hulking SUV. She died twelve days later. Her son called it a &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>in the Daily News</a>. Her grandson said, &ldquo;She was extremely independent till her last day&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/24/us-news/hasidic-family-matriarch-who-fled-russia-after-world-war-ii-fatally-struck-by-unlicensed-driver-in-nyc-independent-till-her-last-day/>in the New York Post</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-unlicensed-unchecked-unchanged>The Pattern: Unlicensed, Unchecked, Unchanged</h3><p><strong>Unlicensed drivers keep killing.</strong> The man behind the wheel that night had no license. He was charged and released. The street did not change. The city did not change. The next week, another unlicensed driver killed a mother and her two daughters in Brooklyn. The pattern is clear. The pain is fresh. The system shrugs.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to act.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. No new redesigns or safety measures have been announced for these deadly intersections. No bold statements from the council or community board. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to redesign the crossings where people die. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
