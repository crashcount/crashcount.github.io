Two left with injuries that may never heal.</strong> In Crown Heights (South), the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have killed five people and left hundreds more hurt. In the last year alone, 190 people were injured on these streets. Two were hurt so badly they may never walk the same again. One was a woman, 101 years old, crossing with the light. She was struck by an unlicensed driver in a hulking SUV. She died twelve days later. Her son called it a &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>in the Daily News</a>. Her grandson said, &ldquo;She was extremely independent till her last day&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/24/us-news/hasidic-family-matriarch-who-fled-russia-after-world-war-ii-fatally-struck-by-unlicensed-driver-in-nyc-independent-till-her-last-day/>in the New York Post</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-unlicensed-unchecked-unchanged>The Pattern: Unlicensed, Unchecked, Unchanged</h3><p><strong>Unlicensed drivers keep killing.</strong> The man behind the wheel that night had no license. He was charged and released. The street did not change. The city did not change. The next week, another unlicensed driver killed a mother and her two daughters in Brooklyn. The pattern is clear. The pain is fresh. The system shrugs.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to act.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. No new redesigns or safety measures have been announced for these deadly intersections. No bold statements from the council or community board. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to redesign the crossings where people die. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

This marks the lowest bus lane mileage since 2018. The matter, titled 'Adams Has Proposed Just 7 Miles of Bus Lanes This Year — Less Than 1/4 of Requirement,' has drawn sharp criticism. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie called it 'unacceptable that Mayor Adams has not prioritized improving bus speeds, service, and reliability.' Scott Stringer accused the administration of using 'community engagement as an excuse to not get things done.' Brad Lander pledged to push for more dedicated bus lanes. Riders like Alex Gean described daily gridlock. The DOT claims more lanes are coming, but offers no details. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain at risk as the city fails to meet its own safety and mobility targets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report cites "Following Too Closely" as the contributing factor, indicating driver error by the SUV operator. Three female occupants in the sedan, aged 47, 59, and 72, sustained contusions and bruises to their neck and chest areas. None were ejected and all remained conscious. The 72-year-old front passenger was using a lap belt and harness. The report does not list any contributing factors related to the victims.

They protested Governor Kathy Hochul’s June 5 decision to suspend congestion pricing, a move that froze $16.5 billion in MTA upgrades, including elevators for Bed-Stuy’s busy station. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the urgent need for accessibility: 'We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now,' said State Sen. Jabari Brisport. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible. The hold traps thousands—seniors, parents, disabled riders—forcing them to risk dangerous streets or skip transit altogether.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police cite driver error as the primary cause, with no vehicle damage reported.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred on Carroll Street near Franklin Avenue in Brooklyn at 12:30 PM. A sedan traveling north was making a left turn and committed 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper,' colliding with a southbound e-scooter rider. The e-scooter driver, a 48-year-old man wearing a helmet, sustained a concussion and injuries to his elbow, lower arm, and hand. The report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor but emphasizes the sedan driver's improper lane use as the primary cause. Neither vehicle showed damage upon impact. The e-scooter rider was conscious and not ejected from his vehicle. The data underscores systemic dangers posed by driver lane violations in Brooklyn streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Zellnor Myrie voiced strong opposition, stating, 'I am opposed to the Governor’s last-minute plan to cancel congestion pricing. I will vote against any plan that will redirect funds from other priorities to cover the revenue lost from congestion pricing.' Hochul’s payroll tax proposal failed. An IOU from the general fund faces resistance. Critics argue only congestion pricing offers stable, legal funding. No alternative secures the MTA’s capital needs.

Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
