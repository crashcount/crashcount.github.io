The pain is fresh. The system shrugs.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to act.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. No new redesigns or safety measures have been announced for these deadly intersections. No bold statements from the council or community board. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to redesign the crossings where people die. Tell them to keep the cameras on. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A 2021 Honda sedan, driven by an unlicensed male driver, was changing lanes when it struck the left side doors of a 2023 BMW sedan traveling north. The BMW driver was a licensed female traveling straight ahead. The point of impact was the right front bumper of the BMW and the left side doors of the Honda. The unlicensed driver’s lane change caused the collision. Two occupants in the Honda were injured: the 35-year-old male driver suffered facial injuries and whiplash, and a 29-year-old male passenger sustained shoulder and upper arm injuries with whiplash. Both were not ejected and used safety restraints.
