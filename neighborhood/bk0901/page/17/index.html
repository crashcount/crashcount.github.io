If it works, Central Park could be next.</p><p class=mb3>On March 8, 2023, city officials announced a major redesign of Prospect Park’s East Drive. The project, not tied to a specific council bill, begins March 12 and is billed as an 18-month pilot. The main loop’s eastern stretch will be repaved and repainted, giving cyclists a 16-to-18-foot shared lane with authorized vehicles, flanked by two pedestrian lanes up to 14 feet wide. The city rejected a two-bike-lane alternative, citing pedestrian access needs. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie praised the upgrade, calling Prospect Park a treasure. Chief Public Realm Officer Ya-Ting Liu said, 'Re-examining how we design the roads in our park system is a perfect example of how we’re advancing the Mayor’s vision for quality public spaces throughout the city.' Officials stress the park is closed to private vehicles. The redesign aims to set a new standard for park safety and access across New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, 'Most New York City households don’t own a car, yet most street space is given to motor vehicles, interfering with city life.' The author criticizes the Department of Transportation and city leaders for maintaining car dominance, rebuilding highways like the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, and failing to meet Vision Zero goals. The piece cites Attorney General Letitia James’s stance on truck depots and calls for NYC to follow cities like Helsinki and Oslo, which have eliminated pedestrian deaths.

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Despite video and a civilian board’s finding of abuse, an NYPD judge found no misconduct. Myrie calls the system rotten. No officers face charges.</p><p class=mb3>On January 31, 2023, the NYPD declined to charge Officer Michael Kovalik for threatening Brooklyn State Senator Zellnor Myrie with pepper spray during a 2020 George Floyd protest. The case, reviewed internally by Assistant Trial Commissioner Josh Kleiman, ended with Kovalik cleared of wrongdoing. The Civilian Complaint Review Board had found Kovalik abused his authority, but Kleiman ruled, 'The evidence fails to support either of the specifications with which Respondent is charged.' NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell signed off on the decision. Senator Myrie, who testified about being shoved and threatened, condemned the ruling: 'This ruling is EXACTLY why New Yorkers have zero faith in the system.' Myrie and then-Assembly Member Diana Richardson, both detained at the protest, have filed a federal lawsuit. The NYPD’s internal process shielded officers from accountability, leaving vulnerable protesters exposed to unchecked force.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
