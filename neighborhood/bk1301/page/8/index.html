But the wounds run deep. In the past twelve months, 103 people were injured in 186 crashes. Not one month passed without pain. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. Three people suffered injuries so severe they may never forget. The youngest hurt was a baby. The oldest, someone’s grandparent. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</p><p>A 29-year-old woman, walking along Ocean Parkway, was struck by a sedan. The driver was distracted and inexperienced. She left the scene in shock, arm broken, life changed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A child, not yet a year old, was bruised in a crash on the Belt Parkway ramp. The cause: unsafe speed and driver distraction. The child was in a car seat. It was not enough.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Local leaders talk about safety. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. They praise speed cameras and intersection redesigns. But in Gravesend (South), the blood still runs. The city has the power to lower speeds to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring.</p><p>As the mayor <a href=#citations>said</a>, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.” But words do not slow cars. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p>No one should accept this as normal. The city can lower speed limits. It can harden crosswalks. It can keep cameras running. It can do more. But it will not act unless pushed. The cost of waiting is measured in broken bodies, not just numbers.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another child to be hurt, another walker to be struck. The slow disaster will not stop itself. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Cars keep cutting through.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0872-2022 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced on December 21, 2022, and filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to illegal curb cuts and requiring local community board notification of curb cut applications.” Council Members Crystal Hudson (primary), Joseph C. Borelli, Justin L. Brannan, Robert F. Holden, and Kalman Yeger sponsored. The bill required DOT to investigate illegal curb cut complaints within 30 days, mark illegal cuts with green paint, and force owners to restore or legalize them. If owners failed, DOT would repair and recover costs. Community boards would get notice of new curb cut permits and sixty days to comment. The bill did not pass. No safety analyst reviewed its impact for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection, despite a history of crashes, has not been redesigned. No charges were filed against the driver, even though evidence suggested a failure to yield. Days earlier, Monica Chen, a pedestrian, was killed by a turning driver in Bay Ridge. Again, no charges. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and City Council Member Justin Brannan expressed outrage, stating, "We are both outraged that the epidemic of traffic violence continues and as a result, a 67 year old woman is dead." They pledged to press the Department of Transportation for more safety measures. The NYPD declined comment. The Bronx faces a surge in road deaths.
