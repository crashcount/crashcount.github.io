But the wounds run deep. In the past twelve months, 103 people were injured in 186 crashes. Not one month passed without pain. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. Three people suffered injuries so severe they may never forget. The youngest hurt was a baby. The oldest, someone’s grandparent. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</p><p>A 29-year-old woman, walking along Ocean Parkway, was struck by a sedan. The driver was distracted and inexperienced. She left the scene in shock, arm broken, life changed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A child, not yet a year old, was bruised in a crash on the Belt Parkway ramp. The cause: unsafe speed and driver distraction. The child was in a car seat. It was not enough.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Local leaders talk about safety. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. They praise speed cameras and intersection redesigns. But in Gravesend (South), the blood still runs. The city has the power to lower speeds to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring.</p><p>As the mayor <a href=#citations>said</a>, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.” But words do not slow cars. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p>No one should accept this as normal. The city can lower speed limits. It can harden crosswalks. It can keep cameras running. It can do more. But it will not act unless pushed. The cost of waiting is measured in broken bodies, not just numbers.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another child to be hurt, another walker to be struck. The slow disaster will not stop itself. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill sought to amend city law to 'restrict the use of bus lanes by sight-seeing buses.' It would have prohibited sightseeing buses from using bus lanes between 7–10 a.m. and 4–7 p.m. on weekdays. The Department of Transportation would also be barred from authorizing sightseeing bus stops in bus lanes during those hours.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting school bus parking on city streets overnight and on weekends,' aimed to stop school buses from parking on city streets between 5:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. on weekdays and all weekend. The measure was referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Sponsors included Justin L. Brannan (primary), Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, Sandy Nurse, and Marjorie Velázquez. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. School buses continue to occupy curb space overnight, leaving visibility and access issues for pedestrians and cyclists unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brannan said, 'I agree with what the advocates are saying, based on the language on that bill. The language as introduced did not reflect what I was after. We withdrew it to amend it.'

Debate rages as advocates call for clarity and safety.</p><p class=mb3>On February 14, 2022, Council Member Justin Brannan introduced a bill to the New York City Council. The bill would require commercial parking garages to charge the same rate for all light-duty vehicles under 8,500 pounds, including sedans, vans, SUVs, and pickups. Brannan claims the measure fights arbitrary price-gouging, saying, 'The idea is to make it fair for people who choose to drive.' Critics, like StreetsPAC's Eric McClure, argue the bill subsidizes SUV use and endangers city streets, stating, 'We shouldn’t be bending over backwards to further subsidize someone’s choice to drive an SUV or pickup truck in New York City.' Brannan admits the bill needs revision. The bill’s status and committee assignment remain unclear. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
