But the wounds run deep. In the past twelve months, 103 people were injured in 186 crashes. Not one month passed without pain. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. Three people suffered injuries so severe they may never forget. The youngest hurt was a baby. The oldest, someone’s grandparent. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</p><p>A 29-year-old woman, walking along Ocean Parkway, was struck by a sedan. The driver was distracted and inexperienced. She left the scene in shock, arm broken, life changed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A child, not yet a year old, was bruised in a crash on the Belt Parkway ramp. The cause: unsafe speed and driver distraction. The child was in a car seat. It was not enough.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Local leaders talk about safety. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. They praise speed cameras and intersection redesigns. But in Gravesend (South), the blood still runs. The city has the power to lower speeds to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring.</p><p>As the mayor <a href=#citations>said</a>, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.” But words do not slow cars. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p>No one should accept this as normal. The city can lower speed limits. It can harden crosswalks. It can keep cameras running. It can do more. But it will not act unless pushed. The cost of waiting is measured in broken bodies, not just numbers.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another child to be hurt, another walker to be struck. The slow disaster will not stop itself. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article quotes Councilmember Farrah Louis: "It appeared the driver was driving and hit the gas instead of the brakes, trying to avoid another car, and that's how he crashed." No students were on the bus at the time. The victims were hospitalized with serious injuries. Witnesses described the bus waiting for a pedestrian before suddenly jumping the curb and smashing through the fence. The incident highlights ongoing traffic dangers in the area and raises questions about driver error and the need for improved street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver had a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' according to State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The bill would require speed-limiting devices for drivers with repeated offenses, targeting those with 11 or more points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall to demand action. The article notes that auto deaths have outpaced gun deaths in New York City for two years.
