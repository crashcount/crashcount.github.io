But the wounds run deep. In the past twelve months, 103 people were injured in 186 crashes. Not one month passed without pain. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. Three people suffered injuries so severe they may never forget. The youngest hurt was a baby. The oldest, someone’s grandparent. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</p><p>A 29-year-old woman, walking along Ocean Parkway, was struck by a sedan. The driver was distracted and inexperienced. She left the scene in shock, arm broken, life changed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A child, not yet a year old, was bruised in a crash on the Belt Parkway ramp. The cause: unsafe speed and driver distraction. The child was in a car seat. It was not enough.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Local leaders talk about safety. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. They praise speed cameras and intersection redesigns. But in Gravesend (South), the blood still runs. The city has the power to lower speeds to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring.</p><p>As the mayor <a href=#citations>said</a>, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.” But words do not slow cars. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p>No one should accept this as normal. The city can lower speed limits. It can harden crosswalks. It can keep cameras running. It can do more. But it will not act unless pushed. The cost of waiting is measured in broken bodies, not just numbers.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another child to be hurt, another walker to be struck. The slow disaster will not stop itself. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The driver had a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' according to State Senator Andrew Gounardes. The bill would require speed-limiting devices for drivers with repeated violations or high point totals. Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall, urging swift passage. The article notes that similar measures, like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act, have struggled with implementation. The crash highlights gaps in enforcement and policy, as auto deaths now outpace gun deaths in New York City for the second year running.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

After a speeding driver killed three people on April 1, 2025, Felder made no statement and skipped the victims’ funeral. The matter highlights his history: he blocked speed cameras in 2013, voted against their expansion in 2014, and fought street redesigns and busways. Felder once blamed a dead cyclist after a fatal crash. The article states, 'Felder has a long record of opposing street safety measures, including Vision Zero, speed cameras, speed limits, and street redesigns.'
