Since January 2022, there have been 638 crashes. Three left victims with serious injuries. No one has been killed—yet. But 335 have been hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. A 68-year-old man, incoherent and bleeding from the head, after a collision with an SUV. A 69-year-old cyclist, thrown and scraped, helmet cracked. A 19-year-old woman, her arm torn open after a left-turning SUV met her e-scooter. These are not numbers. These are lives, changed in a heartbeat.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. Out of all pedestrian injuries, 53 came from cars and SUVs, 4 from trucks and buses, 1 from a bike, and 1 from a moped. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are not in your favor if you walk or ride.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-doand-dont>What Leaders Do—And Don’t</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks—a move to clear sightlines and save lives.

It waits by the phone.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them: lower the speed, clear the crosswalks, stop the repeat offenders. Do not wait for the first death.

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

The law orders the Department of Transportation to post current bicycle and micromobility ridership data online, updated monthly or at least yearly. The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Restler, Hudson, Schulman, and others. The law demands transparency on where riders travel and what DOT does to keep them safe. This opens the books on bike movement and exposes gaps in protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They slammed the Governor’s pause on congestion pricing. The move guts $15 billion from transit upgrades. Projects for elevators and ramps stall. Disabled riders, seniors, and veterans lose out. Politicians split. Riders left stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the MTA Board heard public testimony and political debate on the fallout from Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing, which was set to begin June 30. The meeting focused on the loss of funding for transit accessibility. The matter, described as 'New Yorkers decry loss of congestion pricing money for accessible transit to MTA Board,' drew sharp criticism from disability advocates and riders. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, representing District 23, praised the Governor’s pause, calling congestion pricing 'the wrong plan for my constituents.' The pause leaves a $15 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, halting upgrades like elevators and ramps at dozens of stations. Advocates warned that without this funding, disabled New Yorkers, seniors, and veterans remain shut out of the subway. The MTA faces a federal mandate to make 95% of stations accessible by 2055, but these projects now stall. Riders demanded action. Politicians offered little hope.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
