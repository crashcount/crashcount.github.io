But the wounds run deep. In the past twelve months, 103 people were injured in 186 crashes. Not one month passed without pain. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. Three people suffered injuries so severe they may never forget. The youngest hurt was a baby. The oldest, someone’s grandparent. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</p><p>A 29-year-old woman, walking along Ocean Parkway, was struck by a sedan. The driver was distracted and inexperienced. She left the scene in shock, arm broken, life changed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A child, not yet a year old, was bruised in a crash on the Belt Parkway ramp. The cause: unsafe speed and driver distraction. The child was in a car seat. It was not enough.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Local leaders talk about safety. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. They praise speed cameras and intersection redesigns. But in Gravesend (South), the blood still runs. The city has the power to lower speeds to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring.</p><p>As the mayor <a href=#citations>said</a>, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.” But words do not slow cars. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p>No one should accept this as normal. The city can lower speed limits. It can harden crosswalks. It can keep cameras running. It can do more. But it will not act unless pushed. The cost of waiting is measured in broken bodies, not just numbers.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another child to be hurt, another walker to be struck. The slow disaster will not stop itself. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that traffic study determinations be issued no later than 60 days from the date a traffic control device is requested by a city council member or community board.” Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Schulman, Brooks-Powers, and Vernikov. Their bill demands the Department of Transportation deliver traffic study decisions within 60 days of a request. Right now, there’s no set timeline. The bill aims to end delays, forcing the city to move faster when lives are at stake.

Council Member James F. Gennaro leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gale A. Brewer, Christopher Marte, Alexa Avilés, Farah N. Louis, and Justin L. Brannan. The bill would require commercial e-bikes to be registered and display visible license information. Employers, not delivery workers, would be fined for violations like sidewalk riding.

No vote yet.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0037-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on February 8, 2024. The bill's title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing civil penalties for operating a bicycle, bicycle with electric assist, or electric scooter on the sidewalk.' Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), James F. Gennaro, Justin L. Brannan, Gale A. Brewer, and Sandra Ung back the measure. The bill would raise fines for anyone caught riding a bike, e-bike, or scooter on sidewalks. Supporters say higher penalties will curb sidewalk riding and protect pedestrians. The bill awaits further action in committee. No safety analyst has assessed its impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The editorial claims, 'solving [MTA fiscal problems] by punishing average New Yorkers simply for driving is insane,' and highlights concerns over economic burden.

Borelli (District 51) joined seventeen other lawmakers in a federal lawsuit to block New York City’s $15 congestion pricing toll for Midtown Manhattan. The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation. The case highlights the political and environmental battle over how to fund and shape New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary driver error. The pedestrian sustained head abrasions and remained conscious after the impact. The report also notes 'Pavement Slippery' as a contributing factor, which may have affected vehicle control or pedestrian footing. The sedan showed no visible damage, indicating a glancing impact. The driver was licensed and traveling straight ahead.

Council Member Justin Brannan responded, saying, 'The answer will not bring our neighbor back, but they absolutely matter, especially after learning this driver has [so many] school zone speed camera violations!' City records show speed camera tickets do not count against a driver’s record, so licenses are not suspended or revoked. All tickets were paid, preventing booting or towing.
