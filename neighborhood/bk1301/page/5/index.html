Since January 2022, there have been 638 crashes. Three left victims with serious injuries. No one has been killed—yet. But 335 have been hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. A 68-year-old man, incoherent and bleeding from the head, after a collision with an SUV. A 69-year-old cyclist, thrown and scraped, helmet cracked. A 19-year-old woman, her arm torn open after a left-turning SUV met her e-scooter. These are not numbers. These are lives, changed in a heartbeat.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. Out of all pedestrian injuries, 53 came from cars and SUVs, 4 from trucks and buses, 1 from a bike, and 1 from a moped. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are not in your favor if you walk or ride.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-doand-dont>What Leaders Do—And Don’t</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks—a move to clear sightlines and save lives.

He spoke against a bill to fit repeat speeders’ cars with limiters. He called enforcement excessive. Mourners demanded action. The street remains deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On March 31, 2025, Assembly Member Michael Novakhov publicly opposed a state bill requiring speed-limiting devices for cars owned by repeat speeders. The statement came at the funeral for Natasha Saada and her children, killed by a speeding driver on Ocean Parkway. Novakhov argued, 'six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,' and claimed, 'any driver can get much more than six.' He also denounced speed cameras, saying, 'we have too many,' and that they punish regular drivers. The bill’s matter summary centers on requiring devices for vehicles with six violations in a year. Community members and advocates at the funeral demanded stronger accountability and cited the area’s deadly history. Other local politicians, including Kalman Yeger and Simcha Felder, have also opposed speed safety measures. The Department of Transportation has not recommended major changes to Ocean Parkway, despite ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
