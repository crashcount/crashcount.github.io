But the blood still runs. In the past 12 months, 132 people were injured in 188 crashes. Two were left with serious wounds. Children were not spared—ten under 18 were hurt. The old were not spared—one over 75 was struck. The numbers do not rest. They pile up, slow and steady, like the sound of tires on wet asphalt.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>A 19-year-old bled from his arm after a motorcycle crash. A 56-year-old woman was left with torn flesh after a collision on Queens Boulevard. A 26-year-old was thrown from his moped, his leg broken. These are not statistics. These are people who woke up that morning and did not expect pain. &ldquo;He rams right into the side of the car,&rdquo; said Jose DeAguiar, after an Amazon driver hit his parked car and left without a word (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/7-side-helps-get-repairs-covered-amazon-driver-allegedly-crashed-parked-car-drove-off/16474908/>ABC7</a>). The driver shrugged. The victim waited months for justice.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets New York City lower speed limits. But the limit is not yet lowered. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city redesigns intersections, but the blood does not stop. No one in power has stood in Kew Gardens and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that do not bleed.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

TLC Commissioner David Do said, “We made that today.

The transition faced delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic and medallion owner financial struggles. Policy changes, such as alternating accessible vehicles and funding support, drove the shift.
