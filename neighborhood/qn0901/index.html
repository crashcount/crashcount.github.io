But the blood still runs. In the past 12 months, 132 people were injured in 188 crashes. Two were left with serious wounds. Children were not spared—ten under 18 were hurt. The old were not spared—one over 75 was struck. The numbers do not rest.

A 56-year-old woman was left with torn flesh after a collision on Queens Boulevard. A 26-year-old was thrown from his moped, his leg broken. These are not statistics. These are people who woke up that morning and did not expect pain. &ldquo;He rams right into the side of the car,&rdquo; said Jose DeAguiar, after an Amazon driver hit his parked car and left without a word (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/7-side-helps-get-repairs-covered-amazon-driver-allegedly-crashed-parked-car-drove-off/16474908/>ABC7</a>). The driver shrugged. The victim waited months for justice.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets New York City lower speed limits. But the limit is not yet lowered. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city redesigns intersections, but the blood does not stop. No one in power has stood in Kew Gardens and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work.
