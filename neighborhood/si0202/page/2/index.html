The event summary reads: 'GOP pols push MTA boss to resign after brushing off transit crime as New York braces for even more taxes, fees.' The lawmakers oppose further taxes and fees to close the MTA’s $33 billion gap. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season.

Fewer apartments will rise near rail. Car dependence stays locked in. Lawmakers from Queens and Staten Island cheered. Advocates warn: fewer homes, more driving, more danger for those outside a car.</p><p class=mb3>On November 26, 2024, the City Council amended Mayor Adams's 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' rezoning proposal. The Zoning Subcommittee, chaired by Council Member Kevin Riley, exempted single-family districts from new transit-oriented development rules. The matter summary reads: 'Urban Banning: Single-Family Districts Exempted from Transit-Oriented Development.' Council Members David Carr and Kamillah Hanks of Staten Island voted against the modified plan, defending suburban-style zoning. Riley argued, 'One-family zoned districts represent less than 15 percent of the city's land area... they are valuable.' The exemption means fewer apartments near transit, locking in car dependence. Moses Gates of the Regional Plan Association called the move senseless from a planning perspective. Lawmakers in affected neighborhoods hailed the change, but advocates warn it blocks safer, less car-centric housing near transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the truck’s left front bumper hit her head, rendering her unconscious. She suffered internal injuries and died at the scene. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, highlighting the driver’s failure to observe the pedestrian in the crosswalk. The woman was crossing with no signal present, as noted in the report, but the primary fault cited is driver inattention. The collision occurred in broad daylight, and the pickup showed no damage. The deadly impact underscores the ongoing danger faced by pedestrians on Staten Island streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their letter to Governor Hochul followed Brown’s June comments suggesting Staten Island lose its promised 75 new R211S railcars because local lawmakers opposed congestion pricing. The letter, signed by Assemblymen Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Tannousis, Michael Reilly, Borough President Vito Fossella, State Senator Andrew Lanza, Councilman David Carr, and Borelli, called Brown’s remarks 'a masterclass in bureaucratic ignorance.' Brown said he would welcome removal. The new railcars would replace aging trains from the 1970s.
