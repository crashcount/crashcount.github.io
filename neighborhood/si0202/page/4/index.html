The seriously injured: a pedestrian, hit by a bus. The rest—children, elders, workers—left with broken bones, bruises, or worse. In three years, 529 people have been injured here.

The bill orders the city to study which schools have closed each year and to remove speed cameras from those erased school zones. The matter title reads: 'Annual study to identify non-operational schools and the subsequent removal of speed cameras from eliminated school speed zones.' If passed, the law would strip cameras from streets where schools once stood, erasing a layer of protection for people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities.

Brad Hoylman-Sigal (District 47) joined the debate over New York’s congestion pricing plan. The original $15 toll was paused by Governor Hochul in June. Now, officials consider a lower toll or alternatives to fund the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'we need congestion pricing.' The matter, titled 'MTA boss ‘thrilled’ Kathy Hochul eyeing lower congestion toll after NY gov indefinitely paused controversial scheme,' highlights the urgency of MTA financing. Assemblywoman Deborah Glick noted Hochul’s commitment to a replacement plan. The bill’s status remains in flux, with no committee or vote recorded. The safety impact for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—was not assessed.

Two sedans, both traveling east and making right turns, collided. The point of impact was the right rear quarter panel of one vehicle and the left front quarter panel of the other. The 18-year-old male driver of one sedan was injured, suffering chest trauma and shock, and was wearing a lap belt and harness. The police report explicitly cites 'Turning Improperly' as the contributing factor for the crash. Both drivers were licensed and operating their vehicles legally, but the improper turning maneuver led to the collision.

Brown questioned new railcars for the borough after lawmakers opposed congestion pricing. Officials call his stance bureaucratic ignorance. The fight spotlights power struggles over transit and rider needs.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2024, seven Staten Island officials, including Council Minority Leader Joseph Borelli (District 51), called for the removal of MTA board member Norman Brown. Their letter to Governor Hochul followed Brown’s June comments suggesting Staten Island lose its promised 75 new R211S railcars because local lawmakers opposed congestion pricing. The letter, signed by Assemblymen Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Tannousis, Michael Reilly, Borough President Vito Fossella, State Senator Andrew Lanza, Councilman David Carr, and Borelli, called Brown’s remarks 'a masterclass in bureaucratic ignorance.' Brown said he would welcome removal. The new railcars would replace aging trains from the 1970s. The matter exposes deep rifts over transit funding and priorities, with Staten Island riders caught in the crossfire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
