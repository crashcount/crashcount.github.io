But here, the pace is slow.

The bill, titled 'Relates to reducing the speed for owner liability for failure of operator to comply with certain posted maximum speed limits,' lowers the threshold for owner liability to more than seven miles per hour over posted limits. Assembly Members Robert C. Carroll (District 44, primary sponsor) and Tony Simone (District 75, co-sponsor) lead the push. No votes have been recorded yet. The bill targets drivers who speed, holding car owners accountable at lower speeds. This measure could close loopholes and increase enforcement.

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment.

Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs.

Council Member Sandy Nurse’s district saw mandates shaped by community board amendments, not her advocacy. Dan Garodnick, Department of City Planning chair, said, 'parking and housing are no longer coming into conflict in the parts of New York City that are well-served by transit.' The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others.
