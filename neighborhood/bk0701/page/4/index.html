The city remains dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (published March 3, 2025) reports a fatal crash in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. A man in his 20s, crouched in the street to pick up food, was struck and killed by a turning dump truck just before 4 a.m. at Withers Street and Woodpoint Road. The NYPD stated, “The driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene.” No arrests have been made. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is investigating. The article notes this was one of several deadly crashes in Brooklyn that week, highlighting ongoing risks for pedestrians and the persistent issue of hit-and-runs. At least 10 people have died in Brooklyn traffic crashes so far this year, matching last year’s pace.

The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure.

The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others.

Assemblymember Robert Carroll pushes for a higher congestion toll, putting it above his own delivery fee plan. Albany stalls. Riders wait. Infrastructure ages. Danger grows for those outside cars.</p><p class=mb3>On January 31, 2025, the New York City Council debated MTA funding options. Assemblymember Robert Carroll (District 44) voiced support for increasing the congestion toll, stating it should come before his earlier $3 delivery fee proposal. The debate, covered in the article '5 ways the MTA could get the money it needs to fix aging infrastructure,' highlights the lack of consensus among lawmakers. Governor Hochul’s budget falls short. Senate and Assembly leaders have not chosen a revenue source. Carroll’s stance: 'increasing the congestion toll should come first.' Other options—taxing the rich, payroll tax hikes, vice taxes—face resistance. MTA Chair Janno Lieber urges focus on repairs, not expansion. No direct safety analysis was provided, but the delay in funding leaves vulnerable road users exposed to the risks of failing infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the NYPD, 'a man driving a cargo van struck both of them while making a left turn.' Gil died from her injuries; her aide was hospitalized. Police did not arrest or charge the driver. The article notes that Gil was the second elderly pedestrian killed in Brooklyn this year, and cites Transportation Alternatives: '46 senior pedestrians were killed in car crashes across the city last year.' The crash highlights the ongoing risk seniors face on city streets, especially at intersections where turning vehicles endanger those crossing on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooklyn’s gap in bike safety remains wide.</p><p class=mb3>On January 9, 2025, Streetsblog NYC published an essay detailing a crash on Henry Street in Brooklyn. The piece, titled 'A Brush With Danger Made Me Exhibit A in My Fight for Better Bike Lanes in Brooklyn,' describes the lack of protected bike lanes in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. The author recounts merging into traffic, being closely followed by a driver, and crashing on a wet, greasy iron grid. The car sped away. Passersby helped. The cyclist suffered a broken collarbone. The essay notes, 'Our area of Brooklyn is a major hole in the borough's protected bike lane network.' Council Member Shahana Hanif attended a community meeting on the issue. The call is clear: Brooklyn’s streets favor cars, not people. The absence of protected lanes leaves cyclists exposed and injured. The system’s neglect is the danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
