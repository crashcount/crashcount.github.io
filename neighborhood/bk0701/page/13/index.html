But here, the pace is slow.

Emergencies at non-NYCHA properties could override this order, with required notification to local officials. The bill required DOT to report on completed and pending NYCHA sidewalk repairs by June 30, 2023.

The plan, a priority for the Adams administration and MTA, aims to speed up the B41 bus from Downtown Brooklyn to Marine Park. Narcisse and Councilmember Rita Joseph joined Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference, riding the B41 and speaking with riders. Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing followed a Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) investigation, which found Kovalik abused his authority by threatening Myrie and others with pepper spray during a protest on May 29, 2020. The matter centered on 'excessive use of force with department-issued bikes' and the officer's actions at a protest outside Barclays Center after George Floyd's murder. Myrie, detained with zip ties, said, 'I felt what felt like bike tires on my back and on my arms.' He described lasting trauma from the incident. The CCRB prosecutor, Andre Applewhite, argued video evidence confirmed the threats. Myrie and another lawmaker have filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD. The case highlights the dangers faced by peaceful protesters and the use of police bicycles as tools of force.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Four hundred intersections per year. The bill died in committee. No law. No change. Streets stay dangerous for the city’s most vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0479-2022 was introduced on June 2, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to require leading pedestrian interval signals at intersections next to hospitals, libraries, schools, and senior centers. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring leading pedestrian interval signals at intersections adjacent to hospitals, libraries, schools, and senior centers.' Council Member Lynn C. Schulman sponsored the bill, joined by Kagan, Hudson, Hanif, Abreu, Restler, Riley, and Sanchez. The bill would have forced the city to install these signals at no fewer than 400 intersections each year. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No law passed. The city’s most vulnerable—kids, elders, patients—remain at risk at crossings meant to protect them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
