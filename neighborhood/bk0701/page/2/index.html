A cyclist, 28, thrown from his bike on 7th Avenue. A 21-year-old, helmeted, scraped and bruised after a motorcycle and SUV met on Terrace Place. <strong>Children, too—13 injured since 2022.</strong></p><p><strong>Crashes do not care about age.</strong> The numbers cut across every group. Young adults, parents, elders. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> Sedans and SUVs caused the majority of pedestrian injuries. One moped, one motorcycle, and a handful of bikes added to the count. But the metal is not the story. The story is the body on the ground, the limp arm, the blood on the curb.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They tout speed cameras, lower limits, and intersection redesigns. But here, the pace is slow. The law lets the city drop speed limits to 20 mph. <strong>It has not happened yet.</strong></p><p><strong>Speed cameras work, but they are always at risk.</strong> Albany must renew them. Every delay is a risk taken with someone else&rsquo;s life.</p><p><strong>No deaths is not victory.</strong> Sixty-five people injured in the last year alone. <strong>Crashes are not fate. They are the cost of inaction.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit now.

The plan, announced by MTA Construction & Development president Jamie Torres-Springer and supported by State Sen. Zellnor Myrie, promises to 'finally unclog a notoriously slow-rolling segment of the subway.' The project will keep express and local trains on their tracks, cut delays, and boost throughput from 44 to 60 trains per hour. Myrie said, 'I'm proud the MTA Capital Plan includes funding to finally un-cluster Crown Heights so more New Yorkers can get to work and school on time.' According to safety analysts, improving subway service can shift trips from cars to transit, reducing car traffic and risks for pedestrians and cyclists. The work is overdue.

Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach.

Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes.

The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons.
