Action is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On May 11, 2022, Council Members Crystal Hudson and Shahana Hanif sent a letter to the Department of Transportation urging immediate safety upgrades at Grand Army Plaza. The matter, titled 'Brooklyn Pols: Fix Grand Army Plaza and Make it Safer,' calls for more protected bike lanes, speed bumps, improved traffic signals, and completion of stalled capital work. The councilmembers cited ongoing crashes, injuries, and community complaints about dangerous conditions. They requested a comprehensive traffic study and highlighted support from over 2,000 neighbors and local advocacy groups. DOT responded that it would review the letter and meet with the community. The push comes as past improvements have failed to end the threat to pedestrians and cyclists. Hudson and Hanif’s action keeps pressure on the city to fix a deadly crossroads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The process lets residents as young as 11 vote on capital and expense projects. The official matter title: 'Voting for Participatory Budgeting is open in five Brooklyn districts until April 10.' Joseph, along with councilmembers Jennifer Gutiérrez (34), Chi Ossé (36), Alexa Avilés (38), and Shahana Hanif (39), offers in-person and online voting. Projects range from park upgrades to school improvements. Final results will be announced the week of April 17. Participatory Budgeting shapes how public money is spent, but the safety impact for vulnerable road users depends on which projects win. No direct safety assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One vehicle was traveling straight west when it was struck on the right side doors by another sedan making a left turn. The 41-year-old female driver of the turning vehicle was injured, sustaining elbow and lower arm injuries and reported pain or nausea. Both drivers were licensed in New York. The report lists unspecified contributing factors for the injured driver but does not specify driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding.

This bill orders the city to plant stop or yield signs within an hour. No more waiting. The aim: fewer crashes, fewer bodies in the street. The council filed it. The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0101-2022 was introduced on March 24, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill required the Department of Transportation to place temporary priority regulatory signs—like stop or yield—at intersections within one hour of a reported inoperable traffic signal. The matter summary states, 'requiring the placement of temporary priority regulatory signs at intersections within one hour of a report of an inoperable traffic control signal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Julie Won, Kalman Yeger, and Justin L. Brannan sponsored the bill. The session ended with the bill filed, not enacted. Analysts noted that faster signage could 'significantly reduce the risk of pedestrian injury and vehicular collisions at intersections with malfunctioning traffic control signals.' The city’s current two-hour response and 24-hour wait for alternative controls left vulnerable road users exposed. This bill tried to close that deadly gap.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They want special permits to drop parking. They say parking rules drive up costs, block affordable homes, and fuel car use. The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
