The BMW driver was injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>This Week</p><ul><li>Aug 30: Forest Ave at Union Ave — a child passenger was hurt as two cars turned into each other (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Aug 29: South Ave at Richmond Ter — two sedans collided; a driver was injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Aug 13: Forest Ave at Union Ave — a driver turning left struck a bicyclist going straight; the cyclist was injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>The count does not slow. Since Jan 1, 2022, this area has seen <strong>1,026 crashes</strong>, with <strong>3 people killed</strong> and <strong>515 injured</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). This year through Sep 5: <strong>211 crashes, 110 injuries</strong>, compared to <strong>190 crashes, 106 injuries</strong> at this point last year; two people were killed by this time last year, none so far this year (CrashCount analysis of city data).</p><p>Routines break at the curb. A 73‑year‑old man was killed by a turning van at Forest Ave and South Ave on Nov 21, 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4583662</a>). Forest Ave shows up again and again in the records. So does Richmond Ter.</p><p>Forest Ave, Union Ave, South Ave. The records say left turns, inattention, and bad merges. At <strong>5 PM, injuries peak</strong> in this dataset, the worst hour on the clock here (CrashCount analysis of city data). Trucks and vans are in the log too, including the case above where a van killed a pedestrian (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4583662</a>).</p><p>“That&rsquo;s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane,” Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella said of confusing bus‑lane rules on Hylan Blvd — different corridor, same borough — after tallying crashes tied to bad signs (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>amNY</a>). Signs matter. So do turns.</p><p>Where the street fails</p><ul><li>Forest Ave at Union Ave needs slower turns and clearer priority. Daylighting and hardened corners can keep turning drivers off people in the crosswalk. A leading pedestrian interval would give walkers a head start (CrashCount analysis of city data).</li><li>South Ave at Richmond Ter is a freight route. Tighten radii at turns and add truck‑safe signal timing to cut conflicts (CrashCount analysis of city data).</li></ul><p>Speed is the wound that never closes</p><p>Citywide tools exist. The Senate’s <strong><a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a></strong> would force repeat speeders to use speed‑limiting tech. State Sen. <a href=/senate-district/23/>Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton</a> voted yes in committee on June 12, 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/63/>Sam Pirozzolo</a> voted no on a separate school speed‑zone bill; State Sen. Scarcella‑Spanton also voted no on that measure (timeline records). Council Member <a href=/council-district/49/>Kamillah Hanks</a> co‑sponsors <strong><a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1339-2025</a></strong> to let ambulettes use and block bus lanes — a change that pushes people into traffic (timeline records).</p><p>A safer default speed is on the table. New Yorkers can press the city to lower the limit on local streets, and to back the repeat‑speeder bill that would keep the worst offenders from roaring through crosswalks. The next move is public.</p><p>Act</p><ul><li>Tell City Hall and Albany to slow cars and stop repeat speeders.

Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries. The senators warned that inaction could lead to blanket bans, hitting delivery workers hardest. The city’s plan for safe charging hubs faces local opposition.

The event, organized by Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi, focused on whether to reduce the BQE from three lanes to two. Former Brooklyn Democratic Party Chair Frank Seddio opposed the lane reduction, urging allies to resist the change. The meeting excluded some officials who support shrinking the highway, such as Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, who cite environmental and community health concerns. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the city for favoring a three-lane solution and sidelining affected communities. City Hall denied taking a side, stating, 'the decision would be based on a DOT traffic study.'

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Governor Hochul’s 2023 state budget proposal, analyzed March 3, 2023, keeps New York State’s long-running refusal to match MTA funding under law 18-b. The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt. The budget leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as transit stagnates and car dominance persists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Painted bike lanes became useless as drivers shoveled snow into them and plows avoided parked cars. The Department of Sanitation’s new narrow snowplows cleared some routes well, but the Parks Department left cycling paths impassable, showing 'no interest...to encourage cycling.'

One victim was killed at an intersection where parked cars blocked visibility and the ADA ramp. Another, Zabina Gafoor, was struck by an NYPD vehicle responding to an emergency. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city’s failure to implement proven safety measures, saying, 'Our city’s children deserve to grow up without the threat of traffic violence.'

The article highlights the unchecked rise of ultra-fast shipping, noting, 'the fallout looks like a veritable armada of delivery trucks triple-parking in your neighborhoods.' The author supports regulation of rapid delivery, investment in transit, and use of micro-mobility for last-mile trips. Council bill number and committee details are not applicable, as this is not a legislative action but a policy proposal. The piece argues that a delivery tax would push consumers toward sustainable choices and fund shared infrastructure, especially transit. It stresses that unchecked delivery harms vulnerable communities with pollution and congestion, and urges cities to prioritize curb management, electric trucks, and e-cargo bikes to protect public space and safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill 'reduces the radial distance from school buildings for such school speed zones.' This means fewer streets near schools will have speed cameras.

The report covers July through October 2022 and cites 'fewer contractors available, shortages in installation materials, and general political opposition' as reasons for a 42% drop in bike lane miles and a 47% drop in bus lane miles compared to the previous year. Streetsblog’s coverage, criticized by City Hall and DOT, revealed that vacancies and political interference—especially from Council Members Bob Holden and Oswald Feliz—stalled projects like the Citi Bike expansion in Queens and the Fordham Road bus lane in the Bronx. DOT completed only 67% of its bus lane mandate and fell 17% short on bike lanes.

The hearing, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, questioned whether Mayor Adams is honoring his pledge to end road violence. The matter focused on the administration’s failure to meet Council-mandated benchmarks in the NYC Streets Plan, especially protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers stated, 'No New Yorker should have to fear for their life while crossing or using our streets.' She stressed that enforcement alone is not enough, demanding equitable infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods.

One operator, Tonya Abernathy, says, 'As a female it’s harder, because some passengers treat you differently because you’re a woman.' Thejoal Hope adds, 'You get a lot of disrespect, and you got to learn how to deal with that.' The piece calls for better training, pay equity, and supportive management.

No committee or council member is named. The analysis highlights that New York, despite its vast rail network, has not expanded heavy rail since 1950 and has no major projects funded or under construction. In contrast, cities like Toronto and Seattle are building out their systems. The lack of transit growth leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as safe, reliable alternatives to car travel stagnate.

The project, begun in September 2021 and finished last fall, added 1,285 square feet of sidewalk, a new median, and red bus-only lanes on Westchester Avenue. The DOT worked with the MTA to cut a circuitous bus detour, giving Bx12 and other riders a direct path. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'DOT’s work at Pelham Bay Park... may be only one-10th of a mile, but the impact for thousands of riders will be gigantic.' New York City Transit President Richard Davey added, 'Bus lanes don't have to be miles long to deliver a huge impact.' The changes serve 64,000 daily riders, expanding space for pedestrians and shortening bus trips.

The law, named after Carlos Moncayo, aims to curb a surge in construction worker deaths—22 in the past year, the highest in five years. State Sen.
