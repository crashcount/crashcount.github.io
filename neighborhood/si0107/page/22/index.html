Five seriously hurt.</strong> In Mariner&rsquo;s Harbor-Arlington-Graniteville, the years grind on and the bodies keep coming. From January 2022 to June 2025, there have been <strong>902 crashes</strong>. <strong>450 people injured</strong>. The dead do not get second chances.

A 26-year-old, ejected from a car on Goethals Road North, crushed and gone. A 25-year-old, thrown from his motorcycle on Dixon Avenue, chest caved in, helmet on, still dead. These are not numbers. These are lives ended in the street.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and riders are not safe here.</strong> In the last twelve months, one person killed, one seriously hurt. <strong>138 injured.</strong> Children, elders, workers. The road does not care.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But here, the pace is slow. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No major redesigns.</strong> The same wide roads, the same blind corners. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The rest is luck.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have not delivered the changes that save lives.</strong> No record of bold action. No public fight for more cameras, more street redesigns, more protection for those outside a car. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another family broken. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The council can demand safer streets. The state can keep speed cameras running. But nothing changes unless you force it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets built for people, not just cars.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city will close blocks, add bike lanes, and carve out more space for people. Locals pushed for safer streets. Construction may start this fall.</p><p class=mb3>On July 5, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a proposal to overhaul Underhill and Vanderbilt Avenues in Prospect Heights. The plan, described as a 'traffic network and public realm plan,' aims to convert Underhill Avenue into a bike boulevard and upgrade Vanderbilt Avenue with new bike lanes, pedestrian islands, and traffic-calming features. The proposal follows community workshops where residents demanded safer, people-first streets and dedicated loading zones. DOT will close the northern-most block of Underhill to cars, add two-way bike lanes, and install pinch-points to slow drivers. On Vanderbilt, sharrows become painted bike lanes, and new pedestrian islands and turn lanes will protect cyclists and walkers. DOT hopes to begin construction in the fall and is reviewing the neighborhood for further changes. Gib Veconi, a local advocate, said, 'The changes will help force drivers to slow down 24/7.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, part of the Streets Master Plan, faces committee review and community outreach through summer and fall, with implementation not expected before 2023. DOT Director of Bus Priority Kyle Gebhart said, “Everything is on the table.” The agency’s data shows slow buses and high rates of pedestrian and cyclist injuries. The plan divides the corridor into three segments for tailored solutions, including curbside and center-running bus lanes, transit signal priority, and busways. Some business groups voiced anger over possible parking loss, but transit advocates countered that most shoppers do not drive. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein said, “Busways are great for business, bringing more customers from more neighborhoods more efficiently and affordably.” The project’s outcome will shape safety for thousands who walk, bike, and ride.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The petition, described as a call for 'wider sidewalks and a wider median, a protected bike lane, and eliminating one lane of traffic in each direction,' follows the hit-and-run death of teacher Matthew Jensen. Gallagher stated, 'Our community is speaking loud and clear: no more deaths on McGuinness.' The campaign has support from Councilmember Lincoln Restler and Borough President Antonio Reynoso.

The matter summary reads: 'Testing a rat-proof trash container... instead of on the sidewalk.' Council Member Erik Bottcher said he is 'thrilled that our district was the first to be chosen for this exciting advance,' calling it 'another important step.' The pilot takes parking space for bins, sparking complaints from drivers but clearing pedestrian paths. The city plans to expand the $1.3-million program to all five boroughs.

Seven injured. Brooklyn streets ran red this weekend. Drivers struck, dragged, and killed. Victims included a child and an elder. Officials spoke. Promises made. The toll climbs. Vision Zero falters. Blood on the asphalt. The crisis deepens.</p><p class=mb3>On June 26, 2022, Mayor Eric Adams and Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez issued a joint statement after a weekend of deadly crashes in Brooklyn. The statement followed a spate of violence: 'Car drivers killed at least three people and injured seven others, including an 11-year-old boy.' The carnage included hit-and-runs, reckless driving, and unlicensed operators. Adams and Rodriguez said they are 'working every day to deliver true public safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and everyone who uses our streets.' They acknowledged recent progress but warned, 'the disturbing incidents we've seen in recent weeks and the last 48 hours remind us just how fragile those positive steps are and how much more work remains.' The city faces one of its most violent years since Vision Zero began. The numbers: 106 killed citywide in the first half of 2022, surpassing 2015. The crisis is not over. The danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, described as 'crucial for providing protected access to parks and greenways,' faces criticism from activists and residents who say it lacks key connections and leaves cyclists exposed. CB11 member John Kelly, speaking personally, voiced fear for his child’s safety and called for a shift in car culture. Victor Dadras, chair of the CB11 Transportation Committee, called the plan 'a step in the right direction' but admitted it is incomplete. The committee will discuss the proposal further, with a full board vote expected in September. DOT may begin marking lanes in the fall.

The matter highlights that 'Staten Island has the city's lowest rate of Service Delivered.' Riders like Kayla and Brandon Grada spoke of constant cancellations and unreliable schedules. Janno Lieber, MTA Chairman and CEO, said hiring is underway to address the shortage. Staten Island’s service delivery rate was 92 percent in April, compared to 97 percent citywide. The MTA’s hiring freeze and pandemic losses hit Staten Island hardest. Riders report missed work and abandoning transit. The MTA promises improvement, but for now, vulnerable road users face longer waits and greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states: 'City-owned motor vehicles cause the largest share of personal injury and property damage settlements.' Comptroller Brad Lander sounded the alarm, saying, 'These payouts cost over a hundred of million dollars a year, and can never account for the damage to traffic victims and their families. Traffic violence has a price NYC cannot afford.' The NYPD, Department of Sanitation, FDNY, Department of Environmental Protection, and DOT accounted for nearly all payouts. Only Sanitation and DOT responded to the report. The city’s own fleet remains a threat to vulnerable road users.

Speaking publicly, Lieber said, "If it doesn't happen, at some point we can't award contracts that are dependent on having capital, the cash a couple of years later." The matter centers on congestion pricing, which Lieber and advocates call the largest, most environmentally beneficial funding source for the MTA. Projects at risk include the Second Avenue Subway, ADA accessibility improvements, and zero-emissions buses. Lieber opposes broad exemptions, arguing carve-outs weaken the plan. Rachel Fauss, a transit advocate, stressed, "There is no other source to fill that $15 billion hole." The MTA’s five-year capital plan remains stalled, leaving vulnerable riders—especially those needing accessible stations—at risk as the city waits for action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Swapping car trips for bike rides cuts carbon now. Active travel means cleaner air, fewer cars, safer streets. The study shows: pedal power outpaces battery power in the race against climate disaster.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, released June 3, 2022, reviews global transport emissions and the impact of cycling versus electric cars. The report, titled 'Study: Cycling is 10x More Important Than Electric Cars For Reaching Net Zero,' finds that 'tackling the climate and air pollution crises requires curbing all motorised transport, particularly private cars, as quickly as possible.' No council members are named; this is a research-driven analysis, not a legislative action. The study tracked 4,000 urban residents across Europe, showing daily cyclists had 84% lower travel emissions than non-cyclists. It argues that active travel—cycling, walking, e-biking—cuts emissions faster than waiting for electric cars to replace gas vehicles. The findings highlight the urgent need to reduce car use, not just electrify it, to protect vulnerable road users and the environment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Drivers who block lanes face $50 fines. DOT backs the plan. Lawmakers say enforcement is needed. Cyclists face danger daily. Cameras promise real consequences for reckless drivers.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill, proposed June 2, 2022, by Zohran Mamdani (District 36) and co-sponsored by Brad Hoylman, seeks to deploy automated enforcement cameras at 50 protected bike lanes. The bill aims to fine drivers $50 for each infraction, targeting those who block or drive in bike lanes. The matter summary states: 'NYC pols propose traffic cameras to deter drivers from using bike lanes.' Mamdani and Hoylman argue that enforcement is critical, with Mamdani stating, 'You consistently see cars driving in the bike lane. We know that these cameras work to deter drivers from breaking the law.' DOT supports the measure, calling it 'life-saving automated enforcement technology.' The bill awaits City Council approval, with Mamdani pledging to advance it through the summer and fall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
