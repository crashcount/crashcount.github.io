This year through Sep 5: <strong>211 crashes, 110 injuries</strong>, compared to <strong>190 crashes, 106 injuries</strong> at this point last year; two people were killed by this time last year, none so far this year (CrashCount analysis of city data).</p><p>Routines break at the curb. A 73‑year‑old man was killed by a turning van at Forest Ave and South Ave on Nov 21, 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4583662</a>). Forest Ave shows up again and again in the records. So does Richmond Ter.</p><p>Forest Ave, Union Ave, South Ave. The records say left turns, inattention, and bad merges. At <strong>5 PM, injuries peak</strong> in this dataset, the worst hour on the clock here (CrashCount analysis of city data). Trucks and vans are in the log too, including the case above where a van killed a pedestrian (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4583662</a>).</p><p>“That&rsquo;s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane,” Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella said of confusing bus‑lane rules on Hylan Blvd — different corridor, same borough — after tallying crashes tied to bad signs (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>amNY</a>). Signs matter. So do turns.</p><p>Where the street fails</p><ul><li>Forest Ave at Union Ave needs slower turns and clearer priority. Daylighting and hardened corners can keep turning drivers off people in the crosswalk. A leading pedestrian interval would give walkers a head start (CrashCount analysis of city data).</li><li>South Ave at Richmond Ter is a freight route. Tighten radii at turns and add truck‑safe signal timing to cut conflicts (CrashCount analysis of city data).</li></ul><p>Speed is the wound that never closes</p><p>Citywide tools exist. The Senate’s <strong><a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a></strong> would force repeat speeders to use speed‑limiting tech. State Sen. <a href=/senate-district/23/>Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton</a> voted yes in committee on June 12, 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/63/>Sam Pirozzolo</a> voted no on a separate school speed‑zone bill; State Sen. Scarcella‑Spanton also voted no on that measure (timeline records). Council Member <a href=/council-district/49/>Kamillah Hanks</a> co‑sponsors <strong><a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1339-2025</a></strong> to let ambulettes use and block bus lanes — a change that pushes people into traffic (timeline records).</p><p>A safer default speed is on the table. New Yorkers can press the city to lower the limit on local streets, and to back the repeat‑speeder bill that would keep the worst offenders from roaring through crosswalks. The next move is public.</p><p>Act</p><ul><li>Tell City Hall and Albany to slow cars and stop repeat speeders.

Decades of rising car ownership brought longer, not shorter, trips. Streets stay dangerous. Pollution and risk fall hardest on communities of color. The answer is not more cars. It is safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, released April 20, 2022, reviews a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The report, titled 'Study: Car Ownership Doesn’t Always Cut Black Workers’ Commutes,' finds that despite an increase in car ownership among Black workers—from 76% in 1980 to 85% in 2019—average commute times grew longer, not shorter. The study states, 'it may not be possible to speed up city commutes with automotive strategies alone.' The gap in commute times between Black and White workers persists, especially in large, segregated cities. The article warns that subsidizing driving will make streets more polluted and dangerous, with the heaviest toll on communities of color. It calls for investment in bus rapid transit, trains, and active transportation, and for building communities where jobs and housing are close. No council member is named; this is a research release, not a legislative action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, part of the council’s response to the mayor’s $98.5 billion preliminary budget, seeks to expand protected bike lanes to 500 miles, bus lanes to 500 miles, and add 38 million feet of pedestrian space. The council’s plan also introduces 40 miles of car-free busways, a benchmark not found in the mayor’s plan or previous legislation. Adams and other council leaders argue this funding is vital, stating, 'To secure an equitable recovery for our city and improve public safety, we must focus on robust investments.'

John MacArthur, a transportation program manager, notes that local and state lawmakers now lead with rebates and incentives. Council members and legislators in Vermont, Colorado, California, Washington, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have introduced or supported bills for e-bike rebates. Despite the momentum, no current state proposal pairs incentives with new bike infrastructure. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians and cyclists—remain at risk as car dominance continues and federal action lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plans include painted bus lanes, a partial car-free busway, and a full car-free busway between Morris and Webster avenues. DOT aims to finalize designs by early fall and implement changes by mid-fall 2022. The matter summary states, 'Bus speeds are among the slowest in the city.' Council members are not named, but transit advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance and Juan Restrepo of Transportation Alternatives support the full busway, citing faster buses and safer streets for the majority who walk or ride. Local businesses fear losing car customers.

In a letter to the Parks Department and Department of Transportation, they wrote: "Asphalt is heaving and cracking at many points from the northern end of the bikeway to Avenue R... These conditions will worsen as long as they are not repaired or addressed." The advocates criticized the slow pace of repairs, noting the southern section will not be fixed until 2023. Jon Orcutt, Bike New York Advocacy Director, said, "Parks' inability to move projects like these or stay ahead of decay poses big problems for an expanded citywide greenway system." The letter urges long-term maintenance plans and calls for safer slip street designs, demanding drivers stop before crossing bike lanes. No city officials responded.

Advocates want less talk, more action. They demand bus lanes, bike lanes, and fewer cars. Transportation emissions barely dropped in 15 years. Car ownership climbs. The city’s climate targets slip further away.</p><p class=mb3>On February 2, 2022, Mayor Adams announced his new climate team, appointing Rohit Aggarwala as Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner and Chief Climate Officer, and Kizzy Charles-Guzman as executive director of the Mayor's Office of Climate and Environmental Justice. The announcement, covered by Streetsblog NYC, focused on broad climate issues. Advocates, including Jaqi Cohen and Kevin Garcia, pressed the new office to prioritize transportation emissions, quoting, 'improving transit options and creating access for environmental justice communities, while also curbing harmful diesel emissions.' Aggarwala voiced support for congestion pricing, pedestrianization, and bus lanes, promising collaboration with the Department of Transportation. Transportation emissions have dropped only 5% since 2007, while car ownership rises. Advocates urge the climate team to work with DOT on bus and bike lanes, last-mile delivery, and cargo bikes to meet climate and justice goals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Planners shift focus. Streets change. Fewer cars, more homes. Demand-based pricing rises. Public space gets new life. The old rules crumble. The car’s grip loosens. Vulnerable road users watch the system bend.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, published January 31, 2022, reviews the swift rollback of mandatory parking minimums across U.S. cities and states. The article, 'Analysis: The Decline and Fall of Mandatory Parking Minimums,' highlights reforms like removing off-street parking requirements, charging demand-based prices, and investing parking revenue in public services. Cities such as South Bend, Sacramento, Berkeley, Minneapolis, and others lead the charge. State-level changes in Oregon, California, and Connecticut follow. The analysis credits UCLA Professor Donald Shoup’s influence. No council bill number or committee is cited, as this is a legislative trend, not a single bill. The piece notes, 'Minimum parking requirements are on the way out.' These reforms embed parking changes within broader housing and zoning efforts, aiming to cut car dependency and boost affordable housing. No direct safety analyst note is included, but the trend signals a shift in urban priorities that could reshape streets for all users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The real number for maximum benefit is $80. Politicians settle low. The city leaves billions on the table. Transit, air, and streets stay dangerous. Cars keep winning. Vulnerable lives pay.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published January 27, 2022, argues for a much higher congestion pricing toll than the $13–$15 range under discussion. Contributor Charles Komanoff, using his Balanced Transportation Analyzer, finds that an $80 toll would maximize net societal benefit, nearly $10 billion yearly. The article states: 'A $13 or $15 congestion toll might be all the politicians think they can achieve, but such a low fee will fail to maximize the net societal benefit.' Komanoff’s analysis shows the current plan extracts only half the possible benefit while charging less than a fifth of the optimal toll. No council member is named; this is an expert’s call to action. The piece notes that higher tolls could fund subway safety upgrades and faster trains, but the city’s political will remains weak. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as cars dominate.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The wide, fast road has long endangered walkers. Assemblymember Emily Gallagher calls for urgent safety changes. Neighbors demand a road diet, bike lanes, and traffic calming.</p><p class=mb3>On January 25, 2022, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher responded to a severe crash on McGuinness Boulevard in Council District 50. A 75-year-old pedestrian was hit midblock by a driver in a Lincoln Corsair. Gallagher wrote, 'Extremely distressing to see another serious crash injuring a pedestrian on McGuinness. I’m thinking about the victim and continuing to fight for our improvements, which can’t come soon enough.' The street, notorious for speeding and poor crossings, is slated for a $39 million redesign after years of advocacy and deadly crashes. The Make McGuinness Safe Coalition and residents have pushed for a road diet, bike lanes, and traffic calming. The Department of Transportation is gathering public feedback, with construction expected later this year. Gallagher’s stance and the community’s demands highlight the urgent need to protect vulnerable road users on this dangerous stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
