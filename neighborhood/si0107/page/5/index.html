Five seriously hurt.</strong> In Mariner&rsquo;s Harbor-Arlington-Graniteville, the years grind on and the bodies keep coming. From January 2022 to June 2025, there have been <strong>902 crashes</strong>. <strong>450 people injured</strong>. The dead do not get second chances.

A 26-year-old, ejected from a car on Goethals Road North, crushed and gone. A 25-year-old, thrown from his motorcycle on Dixon Avenue, chest caved in, helmet on, still dead. These are not numbers. These are lives ended in the street.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and riders are not safe here.</strong> In the last twelve months, one person killed, one seriously hurt. <strong>138 injured.</strong> Children, elders, workers. The road does not care.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But here, the pace is slow. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No major redesigns.</strong> The same wide roads, the same blind corners. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The rest is luck.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have not delivered the changes that save lives.</strong> No record of bold action. No public fight for more cameras, more street redesigns, more protection for those outside a car. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another family broken. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The council can demand safer streets. The state can keep speed cameras running.

The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2024, Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (District 49) stood with Staten Island officials at a press conference to oppose New York’s congestion pricing plan. The event, covered by nypost.com, highlighted concerns that the $15 toll for driving south of 60th Street in Manhattan would, as Hanks said, 'have a negative impact in neighborhoods of color in the outer boroughs.' Hanks and others argued the plan would burden working residents and increase pollution in Staten Island’s minority communities. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s environmental assessment confirmed air quality could worsen in Staten Island, the Bronx, and New Jersey, even as it improves in Manhattan. The MTA pledged $130 million for clean-up, but local leaders remain unconvinced. Hanks’s opposition underscores the ongoing debate over who pays—and who suffers—when the city tries to curb car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced March 7, 2024, it urges Albany to pass and sign a law creating unlimited subway and bus transfers within two hours for pay-per-ride users. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation, which would create unlimited transfers within the two-hour period of paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority subway or bus fare for pay-per-ride users.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez leads as primary sponsor, joined by Riley, Stevens, Hanif, Won, Feliz, Salaam, Hanks, Farías, De La Rosa, Cabán, Williams, Hudson, Ung, Ossé, Banks, and Holden. The sponsors argue the current one-transfer rule hits hardest for riders with long, complex trips, often in transit deserts. They demand fare equity for all, not just those with short, easy rides.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
