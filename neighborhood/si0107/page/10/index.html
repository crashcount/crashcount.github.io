This year through Sep 5: <strong>211 crashes, 110 injuries</strong>, compared to <strong>190 crashes, 106 injuries</strong> at this point last year; two people were killed by this time last year, none so far this year (CrashCount analysis of city data).</p><p>Routines break at the curb. A 73‑year‑old man was killed by a turning van at Forest Ave and South Ave on Nov 21, 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4583662</a>). Forest Ave shows up again and again in the records. So does Richmond Ter.</p><p>Forest Ave, Union Ave, South Ave. The records say left turns, inattention, and bad merges. At <strong>5 PM, injuries peak</strong> in this dataset, the worst hour on the clock here (CrashCount analysis of city data). Trucks and vans are in the log too, including the case above where a van killed a pedestrian (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4583662</a>).</p><p>“That&rsquo;s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane,” Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella said of confusing bus‑lane rules on Hylan Blvd — different corridor, same borough — after tallying crashes tied to bad signs (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>amNY</a>). Signs matter. So do turns.</p><p>Where the street fails</p><ul><li>Forest Ave at Union Ave needs slower turns and clearer priority. Daylighting and hardened corners can keep turning drivers off people in the crosswalk. A leading pedestrian interval would give walkers a head start (CrashCount analysis of city data).</li><li>South Ave at Richmond Ter is a freight route. Tighten radii at turns and add truck‑safe signal timing to cut conflicts (CrashCount analysis of city data).</li></ul><p>Speed is the wound that never closes</p><p>Citywide tools exist. The Senate’s <strong><a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a></strong> would force repeat speeders to use speed‑limiting tech. State Sen. <a href=/senate-district/23/>Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton</a> voted yes in committee on June 12, 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/63/>Sam Pirozzolo</a> voted no on a separate school speed‑zone bill; State Sen. Scarcella‑Spanton also voted no on that measure (timeline records). Council Member <a href=/council-district/49/>Kamillah Hanks</a> co‑sponsors <strong><a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1339-2025</a></strong> to let ambulettes use and block bus lanes — a change that pushes people into traffic (timeline records).</p><p>A safer default speed is on the table. New Yorkers can press the city to lower the limit on local streets, and to back the repeat‑speeder bill that would keep the worst offenders from roaring through crosswalks. The next move is public.</p><p>Act</p><ul><li>Tell City Hall and Albany to slow cars and stop repeat speeders.

In an op-ed, Cooney wrote, “The time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed, what is most important is keeping our promise to the passengers and workers impacted across the state.” He urged Hochul to deliver a 100-day plan to replace the $16.5 billion MTA shortfall, either by alternative funding or reinstating tolls. Cooney warned that the pause means less expansion, less accessibility, dirtier buses, older trains, and outdated signals.

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2024, advocates condemned Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing, a move that halted funding for 23 new subway elevators. The action, detailed in 'Disabled NYer’s are Victims of Gov. Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Pause,' leaves tens of thousands without access. Michelle Alcaraz and Ray Ray, both disabled New Yorkers, are forced to travel far from home or avoid transit altogether. The MTA’s $16 billion in scheduled repairs, including crucial accessibility upgrades, is now in limbo. Joe Rappaport of the Brooklyn Center for the Independence of the Disabled called on the governor and legislature to restore funding, warning that the lack of elevators treats disabled riders as 'second-class citizens.' The pause keeps stations dangerous for parents, caregivers, and the disabled.

Hoylman-Sigal supports lowering the toll, saying, 'The goal should be mend it don’t end it.' He urges keeping the program alive to save mass transit. Sen. Liz Krueger is open to tweaks if goals are met. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow opposes any revival. The MTA faces a $15 billion shortfall after the program’s pause. Policy experts warn that lowering the toll could weaken congestion relief and transit funding. No clear plan exists. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as gridlock and uncertainty persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates want more.</p><p class=mb3>On June 28, 2024, the City Council expanded the Fair Fares MetroCard program, raising eligibility from 120% to 145% of the federal poverty line. The change, part of the Fiscal Year 2025 budget, was championed by Council Finance Chair Justin Brannan. The bill increases access for individuals earning up to $21,837 and families of four earning $45,240. The council added $10 million in funding, bringing the total to over $100 million annually. Brannan and economist James Parrott wrote, 'By expanding the reach of Fair Fares, we can ensure that all New Yorkers—particularly those who are already struggling during a crisis of affordability—can fully participate in the economic, social, and cultural opportunities of our city.' The expansion boosts eligibility from 932,000 to just over 1 million people. Advocates and Speaker Adrienne Adams say it is a win, but still short of the 200% threshold they seek.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA board approved the pause, forcing a $16 billion cut in capital spending. Projects delayed include modern signals, station accessibility, new trains, and electric buses. The plan, crafted by former NYC Transit President Andy Byford, aimed to fix decades of neglect. Byford said, 'The Fast Forward plan we created in 2018 is as necessary today as it was then.' MTA board member Norman Brown lamented, 'We're turning the clock back.' The pause leaves vulnerable riders—especially low-income New Yorkers—exposed to unreliable, unsafe transit.

The project, pitched as a school safety upgrade, will replace painted bike lanes with a two-way protected lane, add sidewalk extensions, and close two slip lanes. DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals. DOT staffer Alex Ussery said, 'We’ve received some concerns from the community and various elected officials specifically regarding safety around students.' Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.' Installation will begin this summer and finish in the fall.

Riders left stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the MTA Board heard public testimony and political debate on the fallout from Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing, which was set to begin June 30. The meeting focused on the loss of funding for transit accessibility. The matter, described as 'New Yorkers decry loss of congestion pricing money for accessible transit to MTA Board,' drew sharp criticism from disability advocates and riders. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, representing District 23, praised the Governor’s pause, calling congestion pricing 'the wrong plan for my constituents.' The pause leaves a $15 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, halting upgrades like elevators and ramps at dozens of stations. Advocates warned that without this funding, disabled New Yorkers, seniors, and veterans remain shut out of the subway. The MTA faces a federal mandate to make 95% of stations accessible by 2055, but these projects now stall. Riders demanded action.

The plan, discussed in the Municipal Services Committee, would force cars and taxis to turn off, leaving the lane for buses, trucks, and emergency vehicles. The matter summary notes, 'The Bx36 bus, which travels this corridor, is among the slowest in the Bronx, with speeds dropping to as low as 4.5 miles per hour.' Council Members Pierina Sanchez and Oswald Feliz, who represent the area, expressed cautious optimism and called for community engagement. Committee Chair Lucia Deng reported, 'There was zero pushback on the concept of busways or bus lanes.' The committee even pushed for a longer route. DOT will conduct further analysis and present detailed plans to local boards in the fall. No formal safety assessment for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It urges Governor Hochul to reject the casino plan, praising her past opposition to congestion pricing rollbacks.
