Vendors crowd curbs. More feet on the street. Pedestrian presence rises. City weighs who belongs on the sidewalk.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2025, the City Council debated a bill to lift street vendor permit caps and decriminalize violations. Bronx Democrat Pierina Sanchez introduced the measure, stating, 'I am the daughter and granddaughter of street vendors.' The bill aims to replace criminal charges with fines and remove barriers for thousands of vendors. Mayor Eric Adams opposes lifting the cap, citing sidewalk crowding. The matter summary: 'change may be coming for the thousands of street vendors operating in New York City.' Safety analysts note that easing restrictions can boost pedestrian activity and street presence, creating 'safety in numbers' and calming traffic. This could improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
