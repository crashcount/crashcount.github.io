A cyclist, age sixty-two, is thrown from his bike on Bailey Avenue. A teenager, sixteen, is ejected from a moped on Kingsbridge Terrace. In Kingsbridge Heights-Van Cortlandt Village, the numbers do not bleed, but people do. <strong>One killed. Eight seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, 381 injured, 613 crashes—each one a life upended, a family changed forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>The young and the old are not spared.</strong> Ten children under 18 hurt in the last year. The deadliest machines are cars and SUVs. No one on a bike or moped killed a pedestrian here. The violence comes from steel and speed, not from those on foot or two wheels.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can act. But the limit still stands above what is safe. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The city redesigns intersections, but not fast enough. <strong>Every delay is another crash.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who set the rules and draw the lines. <strong>Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more safe crossings, more urgency.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Adriano Espaillat worked behind closed doors to stall Fordham Road bus lane improvements. Bronx lawmakers, once supportive, fell silent or opposed. The project, meant to speed up buses for 85,000 riders, now faces more delays. Vulnerable riders remain stuck in slow, dangerous traffic.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2023, Rep. Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The institutions sent a private letter to Mayor Adams, urging him to block all bus improvements. Riders Alliance and local residents accused them of hypocrisy, citing their public support for transit and environmental causes. The Botanical Garden’s representative demanded an Environmental Impact Statement, citing fears of more car traffic and pollution. Surveys show most Fordham Road shoppers walk or use transit.

Bowed to business and institutional pressure. Riders lose. Offset bus lanes will replace the plan. Bus speeds will rise less. Bronx transit users, mostly car-free, get crumbs. Political muscle wins. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) canceled the Fordham Road busway plan, citing 'community concerns.' The matter, discussed with the community advisory board on May 31, shifted focus to extending offset bus lanes instead. Council Member Pierina Sanchez, representing Kingsbridge, criticized the move: "My concern with the offset bus lane is that we're not going to see significant improvements." DOT's own studies showed a busway would have improved speeds by 30 percent, but the agency predicts only a 20 percent gain with the new plan. The decision followed lobbying from business groups and institutions, despite surveys showing most Bronx residents rely on transit. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein called the cancellation a disservice to bus riders. The change leaves 85,000 daily commuters with slower buses and no real safety or speed gains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry.

Sponsored by Timothy M. Kennedy with support from Jake Ashby, Jamaal Bailey, and others, the bill mandates street designs that protect everyone—not just drivers. The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The bill marks a shift away from car-first planning, forcing cities to build streets for people, not just traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
