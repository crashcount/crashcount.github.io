A cyclist, age sixty-two, is thrown from his bike on Bailey Avenue. A teenager, sixteen, is ejected from a moped on Kingsbridge Terrace. In Kingsbridge Heights-Van Cortlandt Village, the numbers do not bleed, but people do. <strong>One killed. Eight seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, 381 injured, 613 crashes—each one a life upended, a family changed forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>The young and the old are not spared.</strong> Ten children under 18 hurt in the last year. The deadliest machines are cars and SUVs. No one on a bike or moped killed a pedestrian here. The violence comes from steel and speed, not from those on foot or two wheels.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can act. But the limit still stands above what is safe. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The city redesigns intersections, but not fast enough. <strong>Every delay is another crash.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who set the rules and draw the lines. <strong>Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more safe crossings, more urgency.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The move answers NJ’s threat to block data sharing. Without cooperation, speeders dodge camera tickets. Streets stay dangerous. Lawmakers trade barbs. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. On September 28, 2022, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz introduced a proposal in the New York State Legislature. The bill, now in committee, would impose a $50 fee on vehicles registered in states—like New Jersey—that refuse to share driver data for traffic enforcement. The measure responds to a New Jersey Senate bill blocking DMV data sharing, which could undermine New York City’s automated speed camera program. Dinowitz said, 'There's going to have to be a price to pay if my bill passes.' Safe streets advocates and NYC DOT warn that blocking data sharing lets speeders escape penalties, fueling traffic violence. The bill’s text states it 'authorizes the imposition of a $50 fee on vehicles entering NYC which are registered in states which do not cooperate with New York in the enforcement of traffic infractions through the use of photo-monitoring devices or signal monitoring systems.' The fight leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as enforcement gaps let reckless drivers go unpunished.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, presented to Bronx Community Board 8’s Transportation Committee, was rejected in a close vote. Council Member Eric Dinowitz voiced strong opposition to the DOT’s process, calling it 'undemocratic' and criticizing the lack of community input, though he did not oppose the road diet itself. The DOT justified the changes by citing significant crash and injury data, and pointed to successful safety improvements from similar projects elsewhere in the Bronx. Dinowitz stated, 'I have been deeply troubled throughout this process due to the constant misrepresentation of facts and the lack of responsiveness to the community.' Despite local resistance, the DOT moves forward, prioritizing safety on a corridor marked by multiple fatalities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Levine wrote, 'The Hudson River Greenway is one of the most heavily used bike paths in the country... congestion has worsened significantly.' He sent his letter to state DOT Commissioner Therese Dominguez and city DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Local elected officials and Community Board 1, which voted 41-3 in May 2020 to support the change, also back the plan. State senators, assembly members, and council members signed a letter urging the same. Levine and supporters argue the new lane would ease crowding and give e-bike delivery workers—many of them immigrants—a safe, legal route. The state DOT has resisted, citing car congestion.

The bill summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing the fines for the unlawful use of all-terrain vehicles and dirt bikes.' Council Member Carmen N. De La Rosa led as primary sponsor, joined by Salamanca, Louis, Brewer, Joseph, Yeger, Dinowitz, and Sanchez. The measure would have raised first-offense fines to $750 and subsequent offenses to $1,500. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. No safety analyst assessment was provided. The city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—remain at risk from illegal vehicle use.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
