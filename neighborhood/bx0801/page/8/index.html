A cyclist, age sixty-two, is thrown from his bike on Bailey Avenue. A teenager, sixteen, is ejected from a moped on Kingsbridge Terrace. In Kingsbridge Heights-Van Cortlandt Village, the numbers do not bleed, but people do. <strong>One killed. Eight seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, 381 injured, 613 crashes—each one a life upended, a family changed forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>The young and the old are not spared.</strong> Ten children under 18 hurt in the last year. The deadliest machines are cars and SUVs. No one on a bike or moped killed a pedestrian here. The violence comes from steel and speed, not from those on foot or two wheels.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can act. But the limit still stands above what is safe. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The city redesigns intersections, but not fast enough. <strong>Every delay is another crash.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who set the rules and draw the lines. <strong>Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more safe crossings, more urgency.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action. Vulnerable road users face risk if the program lapses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian, a 1-year-old male crossing with the signal at the intersection, was struck. The child sustained a concussion and injuries to the elbow, lower arm, and hand, with an injury severity rated as 3. The report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor for both the vehicle and the pedestrian. The sedan showed no damage, indicating a low-speed impact. The driver was licensed in New York and operating the vehicle legally. The collision highlights the danger posed by driver failure to yield, especially to vulnerable pedestrians, even when they are crossing lawfully.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Councilmember Carmen De La Rosa, representing District 10, advanced a bill to allow food carts within two feet of the curb, instead of forcing them to abut traffic. The hearing, covered by Gothamist, saw rare agreement on banning vending in bike lanes and bridges, but fierce debate over location rules. The matter summary reads: 'NY street vendors and store owners, sometimes rivals, find some common ground.' De La Rosa’s bill aims to reduce danger for vendors forced close to traffic. Erin Piscopink of the NYC BID Association warned of unclear obstruction definitions and overcrowding. Councilmember Pierina Sanchez, another leader, called for real permit reform. The bills, part of a sweeping package, could come to a vote this year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
