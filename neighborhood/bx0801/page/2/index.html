A cyclist, age sixty-two, is thrown from his bike on Bailey Avenue. A teenager, sixteen, is ejected from a moped on Kingsbridge Terrace. In Kingsbridge Heights-Van Cortlandt Village, the numbers do not bleed, but people do. <strong>One killed. Eight seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, 381 injured, 613 crashes—each one a life upended, a family changed forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>The young and the old are not spared.</strong> Ten children under 18 hurt in the last year. The deadliest machines are cars and SUVs. No one on a bike or moped killed a pedestrian here. The violence comes from steel and speed, not from those on foot or two wheels.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can act. But the limit still stands above what is safe. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The city redesigns intersections, but not fast enough. <strong>Every delay is another crash.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who set the rules and draw the lines. <strong>Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more safe crossings, more urgency.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Councilmember Gale Brewer warns that low permit prices could increase car ownership and worsen parking shortages, citing past failures in other cities.
