But people bled.</strong></p><p>From January 2022 to June 2025, St. John Cemetery and its streets saw <strong>zero deaths</strong> but <strong>38 injuries</strong> in 49 crashes. Two people were seriously hurt. Seven of the injured were children under 18. The oldest was over 65. The pain is spread wide, but it is not shared equally.</p><p><strong>No one walks away from a crash unchanged.</strong></p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>A 17-year-old boy, head cut open, riding as a passenger. A 19-year-old, thrown from his motorcycle, left unconscious. A 28-year-old, face bloodied, seatbelt digging into his chest. These are not numbers. They are lives split by metal and speed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>No one plans to die on Woodhaven Boulevard.

They point to Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits. But in these streets, the speed has not slowed. The crashes have not stopped. The city has the power to set 20 mph limits. It has not used it here.</p><p><strong>No new laws. No bold action.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every delay is a risk passed to a child, a parent, a neighbor. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p><strong>If you wait, the next siren will be for someone you know.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The need is urgent.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A 1280, now in the sponsorship stage, sits before the New York State Assembly. Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous. Lawmakers are under pressure to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
