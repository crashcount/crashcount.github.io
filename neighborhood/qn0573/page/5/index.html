NYPD tickets rise, but repeat offenders dodge tolls and cameras. Advocates warn: weak enforcement means more cheating, less safety, and crowded streets. The city cracks down, but loopholes remain.</p><p class=mb3>Bill action centers on license plate enforcement as congestion pricing approaches. On December 11, 2023, Councilmember Robert F. Holden (District 30) supported raising fines for drivers using fake or obscured plates. The matter, reported by Gothamist, highlights a surge in 'ghost cars'—vehicles with covered, defaced, or phony plates—dodging tolls and speed cameras. Holden stated, "If somebody can save a lot of money by obscuring their plates, they'll do it." The NYPD has increased enforcement, but many offenders remain undeterred. Advocates and experts, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, warn that without strict enforcement, congestion pricing goals and street safety will suffer. The city has banned camera-blocking covers and encourages public reporting, but unresolved complaints and repeat violations persist. Holden's push aims to make penalties outweigh the savings from toll evasion, seeking legislative action to protect the program's integrity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Oswald Feliz (primary), Gale A. Brewer, Erik D. Bottcher, and Robert F. Holden sponsored the measure. It would have imposed fines up to $1,000 and jail time for repeat offenders.

Holden (District 30) led a push for his bill requiring license plates and registration for all e-bikes, e-scooters, and similar vehicles. The bill, introduced last year, has 31 co-sponsors and awaits a hearing in the Council's transportation committee. Holden said, 'Let’s find out who they are,' targeting e-bike riders and citing safety concerns. The bill summary states it would require 'license plates and vehicle registrations for any electric bike, scooter or other motorized vehicle.' At a City Hall rally, Holden and supporters pointed to injuries and deaths from lithium-ion battery fires. Pamela Manasse, a crash survivor, called e-vehicles a danger. Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives criticized the bill, saying it shifts blame from drivers and ignores the need for safer street design and better regulation of e-bike sales and batteries.

The matter summary reads: 'Require registration and licensing for all e-bikes and legal motorized vehicles.' Board members Brian Van Nieuwenhoven and Jason Froimowitz criticized the bill as incomplete and unrealistic, noting it would not solve dangerous operation or enforcement issues. Holden dismissed the board’s opposition as unrepresentative.

The meeting opened with a standing ovation for Holden, but tensions rose when NYPD Deputy Inspector Erik Worobey praised deliveristas for safer riding. The crowd booed, voicing fear of fast e-vehicles. The E-VSA’s nine-point plan calls for reclassifying e-bikes as mopeds, ending a park e-bike pilot, and NYPD confiscation of e-vehicles on sidewalks, with a $500 retrieval fine. The group frames itself as victims of 'rogue' riders, though city statistics show drivers of larger vehicles cause far more injuries.

Owners would have sixty days to clear junk, or act at once if hazards loom. The bill died in committee. Streets stay cluttered. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1071-2023 was introduced on June 8, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to require owners to remove disused or abandoned utility poles, wires, and appurtenances within 60 days, and to act immediately if conditions were dangerous. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the timelines for the removal of abandoned or unsafe utility poles, wires, and appurtenances, and the transfer of appurtenances to newly erected poles.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán sponsored the bill, joined by Kevin C. Riley, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Lincoln Restler, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Amanda Farías, and Robert F. Holden. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The bill’s failure leaves hazardous poles and wires on city streets, a threat to those on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden with co-sponsors including Ariola, Riley, Yeger, Restler, Brooks-Powers, Hanks, Borelli, Carr, Kagan, Vernikov, and Paladino. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects. While it aims to protect emergency access, advocates warn it could delay or block street redesigns that save lives for people walking and biking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On April 6, 2023, Council Member Robert Holden called for discipline after witnessing a Department of Transportation (DOT) employee driving aggressively in Midtown, including misuse of a bus lane. Holden wrote to DOT demanding action. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that the employee was identified and that 'appropriate action' was taken, but did not specify what that meant. The city car involved has five enforcement camera tickets since 2018. Holden stated, 'the DOT should expect nothing less than exemplary behavior from its personnel.' He commended DOT for swift action but transparency is lacking. Holden has opposed Citi Bike expansion and the Streets Master Plan, but supports NYPD enforcement against illegal parking and some safety improvements. The lack of detail on discipline leaves questions about accountability and the safety of pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
