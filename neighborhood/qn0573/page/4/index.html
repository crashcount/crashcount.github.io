Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger.

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On August 23, 2024, a group of New York State legislators—Assembly Members Phil Steck and Andrew Hevesi, State Senator Julia Salazar, and former Assembly Member Dick Gottfried—filed a legal brief against Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing. The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, presented to Queens Community Board 5 in June, calls for a two-way cycle path protected by jersey barriers and sidewalk expansions between Cooper Avenue and Cypress Hills Street. The matter summary states: 'Protected bike lanes and built-out sidewalks are coming to Cypress Avenue to provide a safe connection to Highland Park.' Council Member Bob Holden, usually a cycling skeptic, supports the project. His spokesperson said, 'This particular lane benefits those biking to and from the Ridgewood Reservoir and addresses a broader quality of life issue along Cypress Avenue.' Advocates like Bree Mobley of Ridgewood Riders back the plan, citing the area's crash history—166 crashes, 99 injuries in three years. The project targets a corridor marked by high injury and death rates, aiming to shield vulnerable road users from relentless traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city lost up to $38.7 million in unissued tickets between 2019 and 2022. The resolution calls for higher fines, confiscation of plate coverings, and registration suspensions.

The bill, sponsored by Sean Ryan (District 61) and co-sponsored by Liz Krueger, Monica Martinez, Jack M. Martins, Anthony H. Palumbo, and Julia Salazar, passed both votes despite opposition. The measure calls for redesigning streets to protect all users, not just drivers. The vote was not unanimous—several senators voted no, but the majority carried it through. The bill’s focus is clear: safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles. No safety analyst note was provided, but the intent is to cut danger at the curb and crosswalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by nypost.com, centered on the $15 toll for entering Manhattan south of 60th Street. The protest, held on Mott Street, featured Chinatown activist Susan Lee and former Councilwoman Kathryn Freed. Lee warned, 'The congestion toll will really hurt our economy, really hurt our recovery.' Holden called the toll 'insane' and argued it would drive up costs for businesses and consumers. The MTA defended the plan, citing a 4,000-page environmental assessment and promising less traffic, safer streets, and cleaner air.
