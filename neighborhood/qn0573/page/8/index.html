Holden (District 30) publicly criticized Juan Ardila, candidate for the 37th Assembly District, over more than two dozen traffic and parking violations since 2019. The controversy centers on Ardila’s support for the Green New Deal, mass transit, expanded bike lanes, and reducing car culture—policies he has championed in public forums. Holden accused Ardila of hypocrisy, highlighting the gap between Ardila’s driving record and his policy positions. Despite this, StreetsPac, a safe streets advocacy group, endorsed Ardila, noting his support for 24/7 speed cameras and safer biking infrastructure. Ardila stated, 'We need to ensure that every New Yorker has the opportunity to bike and... reduce car culture within our communities.' The episode underscores the scrutiny faced by candidates who pledge to protect vulnerable road users while their personal actions draw criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers failed to act.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0329-2022 was introduced to the Committee on Public Safety on May 5, 2022. The bill aimed to amend the city code to 'establish a reward for individuals who provide information leading to the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person who seriously injures or kills another individual in a hit-and-run accident.' Council Member Rita C. Joseph sponsored the bill, joined by sixteen co-sponsors including Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, and others. The bill would have authorized up to $1,000 for information leading to the capture of hit-and-run drivers, but excluded law enforcement and city employees from eligibility. The measure was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. With the bill's failure, the city offers no extra incentive to help catch drivers who leave victims bleeding in the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
