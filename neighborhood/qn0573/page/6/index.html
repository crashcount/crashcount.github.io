Delivery workers’ safety and livelihoods hung in the balance. Lawmakers targeted sellers, not riders. The bills aimed to stop deadly fires without punishing those who rely on e-bikes to survive.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, the New York City Council advanced a package of lithium-ion battery safety bills. Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to require every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter, and other legal motorized vehicle to be registered with the Department of Transportation and display a visible license plate. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.' Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections. The streets stayed dangerous. The cars kept their edge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Borelli (District 51) joined a bipartisan group at City Hall to oppose the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's congestion pricing plan. The rally, covered by Crain's New York, featured lawmakers including Robert Holden, Kalman Yeger, Nicole Malliotakis, and Ritchie Torres. The group argued the plan would 'disproportionately harm working- and middle-class New Yorkers, increase air pollution in outer boroughs, and raise costs for businesses and consumers.' Borelli called it 'bad policy for New York City.' The event did not advance a formal bill but marked a public stand against congestion pricing. The MTA and Governor Hochul support the plan to reduce traffic and fund transit. The Traffic Mobility Review Board continues to review feedback.

Holden (District 30) publicly criticized Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine for supporting policies to reduce car usage, including more bike lanes and congestion pricing. The matter, reported by the New York Post, highlights Levine’s history of 41 traffic violations, including speeding and blocking bike lanes. Holden said, “He’s the last person who should be advocating for more bike lanes, having been caught blocking one.” Despite the criticism, Levine continues to promote street redesigns and enforcement, aiming to convert a section of the West Side Highway into a bike lane and favor non-car owners in community board appointments. Levine’s spokesman stated that all tickets were paid promptly and steps have been taken to prevent future infractions. Street-safety groups back Levine’s agenda, which centers on protecting vulnerable road users by reducing car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30) issued a statement urging Mayor Eric Adams' administration to crack down on panhandling on New York City highways. The matter, described as 'Panhandling in the middle of traffic on NYC highways is now a thing,' highlights the growing presence of people seeking money on major roadways. Holden said, 'It’s not only illegal, but very dangerous. There’s nothing compassionate about letting people do this. Both the panhandlers and motorists are in danger.' The NYPD acknowledged the issue but stated their goal is voluntary compliance and connecting individuals to services, not arrests. The Mayor’s Office condemned panhandling on highways as dangerous and illegal. Despite these statements, enforcement remains limited, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to high-speed traffic and systemic risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden urges legislation to require all two- and three-wheel-powered vehicles—e-bikes, e-scooters, and mopeds—to be registered, plated, insured, and operated by licensed drivers. He criticizes current confusion over vehicle classes and enforcement gaps, quoting, 'There is no equity if the rules of the road aren’t the same for every powered vehicle capable of causing serious harm.'
