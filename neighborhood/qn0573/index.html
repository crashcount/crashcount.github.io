The bill stalls. Horses bolt, people get hurt. Speaker Adrienne Adams blocks a hearing. The city’s inaction leaves pedestrians, cyclists, and horses at risk. No change for street safety.</p><p class=mb3>On June 2, 2025, City & State NY published an opinion urging action on Ryder’s Law, the stalled NYC Council bill to ban horse-drawn carriages. The article states, "Forcing horses to pound the pavement with heavy carriages in Midtown, where they compete with motor vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians, is inhumane." Seventeen council members, led by Robert Holden (bill sponsor) and Erik Bottcher (district includes stables), support the ban. Speaker Adrienne Adams has blocked a hearing and vote. The piece highlights recent incidents where bolting horses injured at least four people, including a pedicab driver. Despite the vivid danger, the safety analyst notes: "The event text does not describe any policy or legislative change affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so there is no direct impact on their safety." The bill remains stalled in committee, with no relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility. Despite heated criticism, council members did not strongly oppose the request in session.

The measure, aimed at reducing car traffic, pushed more people onto subways and commuter rails. According to the article, 'Subway, commuter rails see overcrowding amid congestion pricing as riders are ‘smashed up against one another’.' Holden said, 'Just like gyms in January, public transit is seeing an initial surge, but the MTA wasn't ready for it.' Riders described being packed in, with no added service to meet demand. The MTA did not respond. The council action highlights a new danger: vulnerable riders now face crowding, discomfort, and risk underground, as the city shifts the burden from streets to trains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage. Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes.

The measure, discussed in the article 'NYC residents slapped with congestion pricing ‘surcharge’ by fed-up companies paying new toll: ‘Hochul inflation’,' has sparked backlash. Queens Councilman Robert F. Holden, representing District 30, condemned the move, stating, 'It’s no surprise that businesses will pass the Congestion Scam Tax on to consumers.' Companies like CompuVoip and Dream Events & Decor now add surcharges for customers in the zone. Holden’s criticism joins that of Bronx Councilwoman Kristy Marmorato and others, who warn of higher costs and increased gridlock. Emergency unions claim response times will suffer.

Holden (District 30) publicly criticized Uber and Lyft for their aggressive lobbying around New York City’s congestion pricing plan. The companies spent millions to sway officials, including Governor Hochul and the MTA, aiming to shape the policy to their benefit. The matter centers on new fees: $9 for drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street during peak hours, and a $1.50 surcharge for ride-hail trips. Holden called it 'corporate greed at its worst,' accusing the companies of rewriting rules for profit. Uber and Lyft spokespeople defended their support for congestion pricing but demanded equitable implementation and opposed double taxation of riders. The policy’s impact on vulnerable road users was not assessed. The debate continues as officials and residents voice concerns about gridlock, costs, and emergency delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The toll stirs anger, hope, and a fight over who pays and who breathes.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2025, congestion pricing (no bill number cited) will begin in Manhattan after a federal judge allowed the toll to proceed. The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
