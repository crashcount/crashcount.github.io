They whisper, steady and cold. No one has died in a crash here since 2022. But the pain is real. In the last twelve months, 62 people were injured in 124 crashes. Not one was called a &ldquo;serious injury.&rdquo; But a broken leg, a bruised chest, a life changed—these do not always show up in the numbers. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians are not spared. In February, a man crossing Bell Boulevard was struck by an SUV making a left turn. He went down at the intersection, his knee torn open. He survived. Others were not so lucky on nearby streets. A 12-year-old was hit crossing Union Turnpike last fall. The street does not care about age.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do the most damage. In the last three years, not a single bike or motorcycle killed or seriously injured anyone here. But sedans, SUVs, and trucks keep hitting. A sedan rear-ends a truck on the expressway. An SUV clips a pedestrian at the curb. The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders talk about safety. The city boasts of new laws. Sammy’s Law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders day and night. But in Oakland Gardens-Hollis Hills, the pace of change is slow. The streets look the same. The crashes keep coming. No bold redesign. No flood of protected bike lanes.</p><p>The silence is loud. No public push from local council or board for more crosswalks, curb extensions, or protected space for people walking. No outcry after the child was hit. No plan to end the steady drip of injuries.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people on foot and bike. Flood the council and the mayor’s office with calls. Demand action.

The plan, set to start June 30, would have charged drivers $15 to enter below 60th Street, raising $1 billion yearly for transit. Hochul proposed a payroll tax hike instead, but State Senator Liz Krueger opposed it, saying, "I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate." The bill’s fate is uncertain as the legislative session ends. The MTA board, city officials, and business groups all voiced concern.

Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk.

The bill, introduced February 8, 2024, mandates that only commercial vehicles may park in these zones between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. The matter title states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the creation of curbside overnight truck parking sections in Industrial Business Zones.' Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), Nantasha M. Williams, Lincoln Restler, Farah N. Louis, Kevin C. Riley, and others back the measure. DOT must consult community boards and report annually on effectiveness. No safety analysis for vulnerable road users is available.

Council Member Julie Menin leads, joined by Schulman, Hudson, Brooks-Powers, Riley, Lee, Louis, Restler, and Gutiérrez as sponsors. The bill would repeal and replace Section 19-189 of the city code, requiring the Department of Transportation to report crash data and feasibility findings to the Mayor and Council Speaker. After the study, the Commissioner may install traffic-calming measures where possible. The bill remains 'Laid Over in Committee' as of June 25, 2024.

The MTA defends the plan, saying it funds safer, less crowded streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 4, 2024, Council Member Joseph C. Borelli (District 51) joined seventeen other lawmakers in a federal lawsuit to block New York City’s $15 congestion pricing toll for Midtown Manhattan. The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation. The case highlights the political and environmental battle over how to fund and shape New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
