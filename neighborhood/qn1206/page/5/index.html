Six seriously hurt.</strong> In Hollis, from 2022 to June 2025, the street keeps its own count. There were 706 crashes. <strong>443 people injured.</strong> These are bodies broken, lives cut short, families left waiting for someone who will not come home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and the old take the worst of it.</strong> A 68-year-old man, struck and killed crossing Hillside Avenue. A 71-year-old, left bleeding at an intersection. A 60-year-old woman, unconscious in a crosswalk. A 19-year-old, dead on 90th Avenue. The street does not care about age. It takes what it wants.</p><h3 id=whats-been-done--and-what-hasnt>What’s Been Done — And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every death is one too many. They say they are redesigning intersections, adding cameras, lowering speed limits. But in Hollis, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The numbers do not fall fast enough.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have the power.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city set speed limits at 20 mph. The law is there. The will is not. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners work, but they need to be renewed. Each delay is another risk. Each silence is another name for the list.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They strike, they crush, they kill. Trucks, mopeds, and bikes are in the mix, but the weight of the harm falls from behind a steering wheel. The victims are walkers, riders, the young, the old. The drivers keep driving. The rest are left behind.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices. Streets can be made safe. Laws can be enforced. Leaders can act. But only if pushed. Only if the silence is broken.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where children and elders can cross and live.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article reports, "On Tuesday, police charged him with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to exercise due care, both misdemeanors." Jean-Baptiste, driving a Dodge Ram, turned left and hit Jimenez as he crossed the busy intersection. Jimenez suffered a massive head injury and died a week later. The driver remained at the scene and was later given a desk appearance ticket. This case highlights persistent risks at major crossings and the delay in holding drivers accountable for failing to yield and exercise care.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They demanded action for safer streets. Lawmakers split on bills: some backed speed controls, others balked. The Senate killed an anti-congestion bill. The fight for vulnerable lives pressed on, urgent and raw.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2025, victims of road violence and Families for Safe Streets lobbied at the State Capitol for the SAFE Streets Package. This package includes the 'Idaho stop' bill and the 'Stop Super-Speeders' bill. The event saw support from several Assembly members and a senator for speed controls, while Sen. Anthony Palumbo and Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposed the super speeder bill, citing government overreach. Sen. Leroy Comrie opposed the Idaho stop bill, citing concerns for seniors. Separately, Senate bill S533, which aimed to block congestion pricing, was defeated in the Senate Transportation Committee. Chair Jeremy Cooney stressed, 'You have to have a plan. If you don’t have a plan, what are [you] doing to get the $15 billion revenue?' The day highlighted the rift between safety demands and political resistance, with victims' voices at the center.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rahimi, the driver, said, "We were driving right off here. Something fell off the train, damaging the windshield." Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
