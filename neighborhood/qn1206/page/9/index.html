Six seriously hurt.</strong> In Hollis, from 2022 to June 2025, the street keeps its own count. There were 706 crashes. <strong>443 people injured.</strong> These are bodies broken, lives cut short, families left waiting for someone who will not come home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and the old take the worst of it.</strong> A 68-year-old man, struck and killed crossing Hillside Avenue. A 71-year-old, left bleeding at an intersection. A 60-year-old woman, unconscious in a crosswalk. A 19-year-old, dead on 90th Avenue. The street does not care about age. It takes what it wants.</p><h3 id=whats-been-done--and-what-hasnt>What’s Been Done — And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every death is one too many. They say they are redesigning intersections, adding cameras, lowering speed limits. But in Hollis, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The numbers do not fall fast enough.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have the power.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city set speed limits at 20 mph. The law is there. The will is not. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners work, but they need to be renewed. Each delay is another risk. Each silence is another name for the list.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They strike, they crush, they kill. Trucks, mopeds, and bikes are in the mix, but the weight of the harm falls from behind a steering wheel. The victims are walkers, riders, the young, the old. The drivers keep driving. The rest are left behind.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices. Streets can be made safe.
