Six seriously hurt.</strong> In Hollis, from 2022 to June 2025, the street keeps its own count. There were 706 crashes. <strong>443 people injured.</strong> These are bodies broken, lives cut short, families left waiting for someone who will not come home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and the old take the worst of it.</strong> A 68-year-old man, struck and killed crossing Hillside Avenue. A 71-year-old, left bleeding at an intersection. A 60-year-old woman, unconscious in a crosswalk. A 19-year-old, dead on 90th Avenue. The street does not care about age. It takes what it wants.</p><h3 id=whats-been-done--and-what-hasnt>What’s Been Done — And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every death is one too many. They say they are redesigning intersections, adding cameras, lowering speed limits. But in Hollis, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The numbers do not fall fast enough.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have the power.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city set speed limits at 20 mph. The law is there. The will is not. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners work, but they need to be renewed. Each delay is another risk. Each silence is another name for the list.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They strike, they crush, they kill. Trucks, mopeds, and bikes are in the mix, but the weight of the harm falls from behind a steering wheel. The victims are walkers, riders, the young, the old. The drivers keep driving. The rest are left behind.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices. Streets can be made safe.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One driver was making a right turn while the other was going straight ahead. The point of impact for both vehicles was the left front bumper. The report cites 'Failure to Keep Right' as a contributing factor to the crash. A 53-year-old female occupant, seated as the right rear passenger, was injured with back pain and shock, secured by a lap belt and not ejected. She complained of pain and nausea following the collision. Both drivers held valid New York licenses. Vehicle damage was limited to the left front bumpers. The crash highlights driver error in lane discipline as the primary cause, with no victim fault indicated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill orders the Department of Transportation, with Health and Mental Hygiene, to run a pilot project testing cool pavement—materials that lower street temperatures—across at least four neighborhoods facing heat and disadvantage. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law in relation to requiring the department of transportation to conduct a pilot project on the use of cool pavement.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by 29 co-sponsors. The bill requires DOT to report findings to the Mayor and Council. Safety analysts note no direct effect on vulnerable road users: the measure targets heat, not traffic violence.
