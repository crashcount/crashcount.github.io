They say they are redesigning intersections, adding cameras, lowering speed limits. But in Hollis, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The numbers do not fall fast enough.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have the power.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city set speed limits at 20 mph. The law is there. The will is not. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners work, but they need to be renewed. Each delay is another risk. Each silence is another name for the list.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They strike, they crush, they kill. Trucks, mopeds, and bikes are in the mix, but the weight of the harm falls from behind a steering wheel. The victims are walkers, riders, the young, the old. The drivers keep driving. The rest are left behind.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices. Streets can be made safe. Laws can be enforced. Leaders can act. But only if pushed. Only if the silence is broken.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where children and elders can cross and live.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

City bows to business pressure.</p><p class=mb3>On November 15, 2022, the Adams administration made busways on Jamaica and Archer avenues permanent after a one-year pilot. The Department of Transportation cut Jamaica Avenue’s busway hours from 24/7 to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, while Archer Avenue remains round-the-clock. The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT offers no timeline.</p><p class=mb3>On November 11, 2022, Councilmember Rita Joseph (District 40) issued a public letter to the Department of Transportation, demanding answers for the slow pace of speed hump installations. The matter, titled "#StuckAtDOT: It Takes Years (and Years) to Get a Speed Hump in this City," details Joseph’s frustration: 'In response to a speed hump request, my office was informed by the DOT that...studies are finalized after two years.' Joseph listed twelve locations needing speed humps; only one was approved, none installed. Eight were denied, several remain under review. Her district saw 1,173 crashes this year, injuring 87 cyclists and 141 pedestrians. Joseph, who lost students to traffic violence, calls the delay 'unacceptable.' DOT says it is reviewing her letter. Advocates demand faster action, saying, 'It should never take two years to implement these straight-forward safety measures.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
