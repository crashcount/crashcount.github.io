Six seriously hurt. In the last three years, the streets of Tremont have not been quiet. They have been loud with sirens, the scrape of metal, and the hush that follows when a life is gone. From January 2022 to June 2025, there were 1,073 crashes in this small corner of the Bronx. 649 people were injured. Three did not come home. One was 26. One was 37. One was 63. They died behind the wheel, ejected or crushed, on roads that do not forgive mistakes. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt>Who Gets Hurt</h3><p>No one is spared. Children, teens, the old, the young. In the last year alone, 193 people were hurt in Tremont crashes. Twenty-two were under 18. One was seriously injured. Cars and trucks did most of the damage. Sedans and SUVs hit hardest, but motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes left their mark. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are walking, riding, or just crossing the street.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, lower limits, and intersection redesigns. But in Tremont, the blood still runs. The council and mayor have the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have the power to harden crosswalks and protect bike lanes. They have the power to act. Every day they wait, the risk grows. Every day, another family waits for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Crashes are not weather. They are not acts of God. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by planners, by leaders who choose delay over action. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, protected crossings, and real accountability. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Schulman, Hudson, Restler, and others. The law forces DOT to publish monthly and annual data on bike and micromobility use, plus crash and safety project details. The city must show where riders go, where danger lurks, and what it does to fix it.
