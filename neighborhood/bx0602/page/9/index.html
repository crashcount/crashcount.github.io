Six seriously hurt. In the last three years, the streets of Tremont have not been quiet. They have been loud with sirens, the scrape of metal, and the hush that follows when a life is gone. From January 2022 to June 2025, there were 1,073 crashes in this small corner of the Bronx. 649 people were injured. Three did not come home. One was 26. One was 37. One was 63. They died behind the wheel, ejected or crushed, on roads that do not forgive mistakes. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt>Who Gets Hurt</h3><p>No one is spared. Children, teens, the old, the young. In the last year alone, 193 people were hurt in Tremont crashes. Twenty-two were under 18. One was seriously injured. Cars and trucks did most of the damage. Sedans and SUVs hit hardest, but motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes left their mark. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are walking, riding, or just crossing the street.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, lower limits, and intersection redesigns. But in Tremont, the blood still runs. The council and mayor have the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have the power to harden crosswalks and protect bike lanes. They have the power to act. Every day they wait, the risk grows. Every day, another family waits for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Crashes are not weather. They are not acts of God. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by planners, by leaders who choose delay over action. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, protected crossings, and real accountability.

Amy Cohen, a mother and advocate, demanded action, showing Heastie photos of victims. Seven new Assembly members, including Yudelka Tapia, Al Taylor, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, and Brian Cunningham, now back the bill, giving it majority support among NYC Assembly members.

Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback.

The matter, described as a plan to 'improve bus service down busy Fordham Road,' faces fierce pushback from the Belmont and Fordham Road Business Improvement Districts, the Bronx Zoo, Fordham University, and others. Feliz, who signed a letter to Mayor Adams, said, 'DOT has completely abandoned the bus lanes on Fordham Road and that has caused the issues we’re seeing. We must ensure buses are moving and we can address that by fixing the bus lanes we have.' The letter calls for repainting bus lanes and installing fixed cameras before considering new restrictions. Opponents argue the plan would worsen traffic, hurt business, and shift congestion to side streets. The proposal remains under review, with no committee or bill number assigned.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bills, now in committee, target the use and sale of fake license plates—so-called 'ghost cars.' Feliz said, 'These paper plates are creating new problems, problems that we do not need in our communities.' The legislation increases fines for driving with fraudulent or expired plates and penalizes the sale of fake tags. Feliz, joined by co-sponsors, stressed that the goal is deterrence, not revenue. He highlighted the threat ghost cars pose: drivers evade tickets, speed, and vanish after fatal crashes. The NYPD and Mayor Adams also announced new tech to track these vehicles.
