Six seriously hurt. In the last three years, the streets of Tremont have not been quiet. They have been loud with sirens, the scrape of metal, and the hush that follows when a life is gone. From January 2022 to June 2025, there were 1,073 crashes in this small corner of the Bronx. 649 people were injured. Three did not come home. One was 26. One was 37. One was 63. They died behind the wheel, ejected or crushed, on roads that do not forgive mistakes. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt>Who Gets Hurt</h3><p>No one is spared. Children, teens, the old, the young. In the last year alone, 193 people were hurt in Tremont crashes. Twenty-two were under 18. One was seriously injured. Cars and trucks did most of the damage. Sedans and SUVs hit hardest, but motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes left their mark. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are walking, riding, or just crossing the street.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, lower limits, and intersection redesigns. But in Tremont, the blood still runs. The council and mayor have the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have the power to harden crosswalks and protect bike lanes. They have the power to act. Every day they wait, the risk grows. Every day, another family waits for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Crashes are not weather. They are not acts of God. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by planners, by leaders who choose delay over action. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, protected crossings, and real accountability. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan promised faster commutes for tens of thousands. Instead, Feliz and Bronx power brokers pushed a weak compromise: repainting the lane and expanding bus lane cameras. The matter summary states, 'Feliz has been a staunch opponent of the Department of Transportation's plan to improve the existing Fordham Road bus lane.' Feliz’s Honda Accord was cited three times for bus lane violations, including twice on Fordham Road, and six times for speeding in school zones since 2020. He claimed the car was 'shared.' Bus speeds barely improved, rising from 6 to 6.3 mph—still below the Bronx average. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain at risk.

The law, championed by then-Speaker Corey Johnson, aimed for safer, more equitable streets. Key projects, including bike lanes on McGuinness Boulevard and Ashland Place, and bus lanes on Fordham Road, were stalled or abandoned. The Department of Transportation blamed staff shortages and budget cuts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and other members voiced frustration but admitted limited power to enforce compliance. Council Member Chi Ossé was mentioned in coverage. Without mayoral commitment, the plan’s promise to protect vulnerable road users remains unfulfilled.

The matter title asks, 'Who is the Activist of the Year?' and highlights setbacks: 'City Hall canceled bus lanes, scaled back bike lanes and stalled open streets.' Feliz’s opposition helped powerful interests defeat the busway, leaving only more enforcement cameras.

The bill aimed to prohibit parking, standing, stopping, or operating a motor vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the parking, standing, stopping, or operation of a motor vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates.' Council Members Oswald Feliz (primary), Gale A. Brewer, Erik D. Bottcher, and Robert F. Holden sponsored the measure. It would have imposed fines up to $1,000 and jail time for repeat offenders. The bill was filed at session’s end, leaving enforcement unchanged. Vulnerable road users remain exposed to drivers who hide from accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, advanced by the Senate Transportation Committee, proposes 'new security features for temp tags, stricter requirements for car dealers, and harsher penalties for illegal activity.' Ruiz, who sponsored the bill, stressed, 'Tougher regulations and fines are needed to weed out bad actors.' The Motor Vehicle Commission helped develop the proposal and plans its own regulatory overhaul. The New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, represented by Jim Appleton, warned the bill could 'punish or burden the legitimate players.' Similar efforts are underway in Georgia and New York City, where Council Member Oswald Feliz has introduced related bills. The measure aims to close loopholes that let drivers evade accountability, a known risk to public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, supported by 17 sponsors, aims to curb deadly fires caused by uncertified lithium-ion batteries. The matter summary states, 'Delivery companies are opposing a new bill...that would require them to provide delivery workers with safe, certified e-bikes and batteries.' Feliz, joined by advocates like Ligia Guallpa, argues that companies profit from deliveristas and must bear the cost of safety. Delivery giants Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub oppose the bill, calling it 'simply infeasible' and propose a centralized fund instead. The Adams administration, represented by Carlos Ortiz, supports the bill, insisting business apps are responsible for worker safety.

The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection has started enforcement, but the core danger persists: safe batteries are out of reach for many, leaving workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders feel abandoned.</p><p class=mb3>On September 29, 2023, Bronx bus riders publicly disinvited Mayor Eric Adams from a planned Fordham Road bus ride. The protest followed Adams's decision to halt long-planned bus lane upgrades, a move that left tens of thousands of daily riders without relief. The Riders Alliance, representing local transit users, wrote, 'You turned around and caved to a handful of drivers who don't even live in the Bronx. How could you betray us like that?' Council Member Oswald Feliz, Rep. Adriano Espaillat, and business interests opposed both the original and compromise busway plans. Despite Adams's earlier promises to prioritize Fordham Road and expand bus priority projects, riders say improvements have stalled. The mayor's office defended its record, but Bronx riders remain frustrated and distrustful.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Local business and political pushback won. The city will only repaint old lanes and boost camera enforcement. Riders, mostly pedestrians and transit users, lose out. Advocates call it a betrayal. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2023, Mayor Adams abandoned plans for major bus improvements on Fordham Road in the Bronx. The plan, once promised by the mayor, would have installed offset bus lanes. Instead, the Department of Transportation will only repaint existing lanes and consider more automated enforcement. The move came after opposition from Council Member Oswald Feliz, Belmont BID Chair Peter Madonia, Rep. Adriano Espaillat, and local institutions. The official matter: 'Adams administration is abandoning plans for major improvements to bus infrastructure on Fordham Road.' DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno confirmed, 'we are repainting curbside bus lanes and continuing automated bus lane enforcement.' Advocates and MTA officials condemned the reversal, noting that most shoppers and visitors arrive by transit or on foot. The city missed its legal bus lane targets last year. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain exposed to slow service and unsafe streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
