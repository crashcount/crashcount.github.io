Six seriously hurt. In the last three years, the streets of Tremont have not been quiet. They have been loud with sirens, the scrape of metal, and the hush that follows when a life is gone. From January 2022 to June 2025, there were 1,073 crashes in this small corner of the Bronx. 649 people were injured. Three did not come home. One was 26. One was 37. One was 63. They died behind the wheel, ejected or crushed, on roads that do not forgive mistakes. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt>Who Gets Hurt</h3><p>No one is spared. Children, teens, the old, the young. In the last year alone, 193 people were hurt in Tremont crashes. Twenty-two were under 18. One was seriously injured. Cars and trucks did most of the damage. Sedans and SUVs hit hardest, but motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes left their mark. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are walking, riding, or just crossing the street.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, lower limits, and intersection redesigns. But in Tremont, the blood still runs. The council and mayor have the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have the power to harden crosswalks and protect bike lanes. They have the power to act. Every day they wait, the risk grows. Every day, another family waits for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Crashes are not weather. They are not acts of God. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by planners, by leaders who choose delay over action. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, protected crossings, and real accountability. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz stated, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz highlighted the broader issue: "We’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced." The incident underscores the risks posed by illegal parking and the need for stricter enforcement and infrastructure checks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, and others. No votes have been recorded yet. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving by forcing speed limiters on offenders.

It aims to 'establish in the city of New York a bicycle lane safety program to enforce certain restrictions on the use of bicycle lanes and/or protected bicycle lanes by means of bicycle lane photo devices.' Primary sponsor Zohran Mamdani leads a coalition of fourteen co-sponsors, including Brian Cunningham, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, and Harvey Epstein. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. If passed, it would allow automated cameras to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, a move designed to keep lanes clear for cyclists and prevent deadly crashes. Lawmakers back the measure, but the city’s vulnerable road users still face daily danger until enforcement begins.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal was presented to the Municipal Services Committee of Bronx Community Board 5. DOT’s plan, first floated in June 2024, restricts the 0.6-mile stretch to buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter summary notes, 'Bronx bus riders are about to get a short stretch of relief.' Council Member Oswald Feliz represents the district but has not publicly supported or opposed this project. Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson, however, called for better bus service, stating, 'We need better buses to move across our borough from east to west.' DOT’s outreach found most shoppers and workers use transit or walk, not drive. The agency chose not to remove parking, responding to business concerns. The busway aims to speed up the Bx36, the Bronx’s fifth-busiest bus, and serve a low-income, car-free majority.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Additionally, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' was noted twice as a contributing factor, reflecting confusion in the bicyclist's actions. The bus driver was licensed and operating the vehicle straight ahead. The collision underscores systemic dangers involving vehicle lane usage and vulnerable road user confusion without attributing fault to the bicyclist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Riders want action.</p><p class=mb3>On October 21, 2024, hundreds of bus riders from the Bronx and Upper Manhattan signed an open letter to Mayor Eric Adams demanding the Fordham Road busway. The campaign, organized by Riders Alliance, followed the administration’s cancellation of the busway after pushback from local businesses and politicians, including Council Member Oswald Feliz (District 15), who voiced objections. The letter states, 'We need and deserve a contemporary design that addresses current conditions on Fordham Road.' Riders report 'outrageously slow and congested bus service every day.' The city’s Department of Transportation repainted old bus lanes, but speeds declined. The Bx12 Select bus now averages just 9.4 miles per hour. Despite higher speeds than the city average, conditions remain dire. The city has failed to meet legal mandates for new bus lanes, leaving vulnerable road users—bus riders—stranded in gridlock.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 26-year-old male pedestrian was crossing outside of a crosswalk or signal when he was hit by a southbound Toyota SUV. The point of impact was the vehicle's left front bumper. The pedestrian sustained a head abrasion and was conscious at the scene. The report identifies "Driver Inattention/Distraction" as the sole contributing factor, cited twice, indicating the driver failed to maintain focus on the roadway. No other vehicle or pedestrian errors were noted. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal, but the report does not list this as a contributing factor. This crash highlights the dangers posed by distracted driving in urban areas.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
