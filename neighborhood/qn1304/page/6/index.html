In the last twelve months, <strong>149 people have been injured</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Two were seriously hurt.

The violence is relentless.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-what-has-not>What Has Been Done, What Has Not</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The city talks of safer streets. But in Cambria Heights, the blood dries and the engines keep running. No new laws. No new protections. No word from the council. No word from Albany. The silence is heavy. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is not chance. This is policy.</strong></p><p>If you live here, you know the danger.

Developers get power.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2023, the debate over Gov. Hochul’s Penn Station redevelopment plan intensified. The $1.2-billion tax break, meant to spur ten new towers and fund a $20-billion transit overhaul, is under fire. The plan, pitched as a lifeline for Penn Station, now faces doubts about its ability to deliver. State officials admit the project will not fully fund the station. Developer Steve Roth, head of Vornado, is not required to build, putting revenue in doubt. Senator Leroy Comrie called for a reset, saying, “the GPP that’s been presented is not longer working.” Critics, including attorney Chuck Weinstock and policy analyst Rachael Fauss, argue the deal benefits Vornado, not the public. Hundreds of businesses and homes could be lost. The project’s value and feasibility remain in question. No safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to require every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter, and other legal motorized vehicle to be registered with the Department of Transportation and display a visible license plate. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.' Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections. The streets stayed dangerous. The cars kept their edge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
