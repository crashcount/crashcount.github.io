In the last twelve months, <strong>149 people have been injured</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Two were seriously hurt.

The violence is relentless.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-what-has-not>What Has Been Done, What Has Not</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The city talks of safer streets. But in Cambria Heights, the blood dries and the engines keep running. No new laws. No new protections. No word from the council. No word from Albany. The silence is heavy. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is not chance. This is policy.</strong></p><p>If you live here, you know the danger.
