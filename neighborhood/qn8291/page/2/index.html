She crosses Woodhaven Boulevard. A motorcycle hits her as the light turns. She does not make it home. Her mother waits for a text that never comes. &ldquo;The night that she died, I spoke to her. I told her that I love her&mldr; And then that&rsquo;s when I found about the accident&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/27/up-and-coming-soul-singer-headed-home-from-show-dies-after-being-struck-by-queens-motorcyclist/>said Paula Henderson</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, two people died and 110 were injured on Forest Park streets. One was a 23-year-old woman, struck and killed at an intersection. Another was a 28-year-old man, crushed on the Jackie Robinson Parkway. One child suffered serious injury.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>Since 2022, Forest Park has seen five deaths and 279 injuries from crashes. Cars and SUVs killed two. Motorcycles killed one. Sedans and SUVs caused most of the pain. No one died on a bicycle. The dead do not care about statistics. But the living must.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But the limit on Woodhaven Boulevard still stands. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. The law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring. Each delay is a dare. Each silence is a sentence.</p><p>District Attorney Melinda Katz said it plain after a road rage killing: &ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/driver-charged-murder-deadly-nyc-road-rage-crash-da-says>she told Patch</a>. But the streets remain the same. Wide. Fast. Deadly.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p>Every day of delay is another family broken. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill. Do not wait for another unopened text. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
