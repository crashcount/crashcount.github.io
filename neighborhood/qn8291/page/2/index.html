She crosses Woodhaven Boulevard. A motorcycle hits her as the light turns. She does not make it home. Her mother waits for a text that never comes. &ldquo;The night that she died, I spoke to her. I told her that I love her&mldr; And then that&rsquo;s when I found about the accident&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/27/up-and-coming-soul-singer-headed-home-from-show-dies-after-being-struck-by-queens-motorcyclist/>said Paula Henderson</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, two people died and 110 were injured on Forest Park streets. One was a 23-year-old woman, struck and killed at an intersection. Another was a 28-year-old man, crushed on the Jackie Robinson Parkway. One child suffered serious injury.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>Since 2022, Forest Park has seen five deaths and 279 injuries from crashes. Cars and SUVs killed two. Motorcycles killed one. Sedans and SUVs caused most of the pain. No one died on a bicycle. The dead do not care about statistics. But the living must.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But the limit on Woodhaven Boulevard still stands. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. The law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring. Each delay is a dare. Each silence is a sentence.</p><p>District Attorney Melinda Katz said it plain after a road rage killing: &ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/driver-charged-murder-deadly-nyc-road-rage-crash-da-says>she told Patch</a>. But the streets remain the same. Wide. Fast. Deadly.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p>Every day of delay is another family broken. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill. Do not wait for another unopened text. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The MTA demanded $4 billion from the city—a 33% jump from the last plan—warning of major subway disruptions if denied. The matter, titled 'MTA threatens another ‘Summer of Hell’ of subway disruptions if NYC doesn’t cough up billions,' drew sharp words. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Queens) blasted the agency: 'Instead of insulting us with baseless threats, the agency that spends $30 million on a staircase should find ways to cut its wasteful spending and bloated payroll before asking for more taxpayer money.' Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility. Despite heated criticism, council members did not strongly oppose the request in session. The hearing left the city’s most vulnerable riders—those who rely on safe, reliable transit—caught between political fights and crumbling infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives lost.</p><p class=mb3>On February 17, 2025, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) announced draft legislation to crack down on drivers who block fire hydrants. The bill, not yet numbered, would raise fines from $115 to $1,000 and allow 311 video submissions for automatic summonses. Ariola said, 'We have seen two fires in the past week that have resulted in fatalities where the firefighters were unable to access the closest fire hydrant.' The measure responds to a surge in complaints—over 134,000 in 2023—about blocked hydrants. Ariola’s office blamed lost parking to DOT bike lanes and racks, but the DOT countered, calling protected bike lanes a proven safety tool. FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker said blocked hydrants slowed firefighting in a recent fatal fire. The bill aims to keep hydrants clear and prevent more deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
