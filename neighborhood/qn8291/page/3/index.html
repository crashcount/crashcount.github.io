She crosses Woodhaven Boulevard. A motorcycle hits her as the light turns. She does not make it home. Her mother waits for a text that never comes. &ldquo;The night that she died, I spoke to her. I told her that I love her&mldr; And then that&rsquo;s when I found about the accident&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/27/up-and-coming-soul-singer-headed-home-from-show-dies-after-being-struck-by-queens-motorcyclist/>said Paula Henderson</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, two people died and 110 were injured on Forest Park streets. One was a 23-year-old woman, struck and killed at an intersection. Another was a 28-year-old man, crushed on the Jackie Robinson Parkway. One child suffered serious injury.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>Since 2022, Forest Park has seen five deaths and 279 injuries from crashes. Cars and SUVs killed two. Motorcycles killed one. Sedans and SUVs caused most of the pain. No one died on a bicycle. The dead do not care about statistics. But the living must.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But the limit on Woodhaven Boulevard still stands. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. The law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring. Each delay is a dare. Each silence is a sentence.</p><p>District Attorney Melinda Katz said it plain after a road rage killing: &ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/driver-charged-murder-deadly-nyc-road-rage-crash-da-says>she told Patch</a>. But the streets remain the same. Wide. Fast. Deadly.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p>Every day of delay is another family broken. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill. Do not wait for another unopened text. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The proposal aims to increase housing near transit, allow mixed-use zoning, and eliminate parking mandates. Council Members Joann Ariola and Vicki Paladino led opposition, calling the plan an 'unmitigated disaster' and disputing housing data. Ariola argued, 'That's what they bought in the suburbs for.' Other Queens officials and residents echoed fears for single-family homeowners and suburban 'character.' In contrast, Borough President Donovan Richards's spokesperson and some residents supported the reforms, citing the city's affordability crisis. The majority of public testimony favored the proposal, but entrenched opposition from Queens officials remains strong. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that the department of transportation maintain curb heights following street construction,' targets a simple failure: after street work, curbs often vanish, water pools, and property owners get fined for city mistakes. Council Member Joann Ariola sponsors, joined by Holden, Paladino, and Vernikov. The bill orders DOT to restore curbs to proper height after any street, sidewalk, or gutter work. The committee has not voted. The bill aims to stop flooding and fines, but leaves the daily hazard for walkers and wheelchair users unaddressed until passed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their bill requires the Parks Department to repair sidewalks damaged by city-owned trees, removing the burden from homeowners of one-, two-, or three-family homes. Owners must notify the city if tree roots break the walk. If the damage is not tree-related, owners still have ninety days to fix it.
