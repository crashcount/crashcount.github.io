Same ending.</p><ul><li><p>Since 2022, Morningside Heights has seen <strong>733 crashes, 3 deaths, and 357 injuries</strong>. Eight were serious. Bicyclists were hurt 74 times; pedestrians 51. These are the city’s own numbers (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p></li><li><p>The pain clusters. The <strong>Henry Hudson Parkway</strong> is a brutal line on the map: 46 injuries, three serious, one killed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). <strong>W 125 St</strong> adds 20 more injuries. <strong>Riverside Drive</strong> takes eight, with a serious injury among them. The worst hours stack up late: injuries spike at 23:00, then noon to 16:00 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Three deaths on their watch.</p><ul><li>A 66‑year‑old man died on the Henry Hudson Parkway after a sedan crash. The record lists him as killed; the Porsche kept going north (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4566438</a>).</li><li>A 28‑year‑old driver died on West 121st Street. Another parked SUV is all the dataset gives us (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4616027</a>).</li><li>A 35‑year‑old woman died on West 126th Street in a two‑SUV crash. “Apparent death,” the city wrote. Nothing more (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4668437</a>).</li></ul><p>Bikes and bodies take the hit.</p><ul><li>A 17‑year‑old bicyclist went down at West 125th and Broadway. The city logged “head” and “severe bleeding.” He was conscious. He was a kid (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4817937</a>).</li><li>Pedestrian injuries here come mostly from sedans and SUVs.

Death moves the city. Why wait for it here?</li><li>Council Member <strong>Shaun Abreu</strong> has pushed on other fronts. He backed worker‑safety and pay reforms for delivery apps (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/10/council-to-close-instacart-loophole-pass-delivery-industry-regulation-bills>Streetsblog NYC</a>) and called a Hudson River Greenway detour “shortsighted,” urging a safer route for cyclists (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>Henry Hudson Parkway. W 125 St. Riverside Drive. Drivers strike and keep moving. The city can harden these turns, add daylighting, and give pedestrians a head start. The map points to the work: late‑night injuries, failure to yield, inattention, bad turns, and red‑light runs all show up in the city’s own tags (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Stop the repeat offenders.</p><ul><li>Albany is moving a tool to pin down the worst drivers. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045/A2299)</strong> would require speed limiters for drivers who rack up points or camera tickets. Senator <strong>Cordell Cleare</strong> co‑sponsored and voted yes in committee (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a>). Assembly Member <strong>Micah Lasher</strong> co‑sponsors the Assembly bill (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States A 2299</a>).</li></ul><p>Lower the speed. Everywhere.</p><ul><li>New York has the power to set safer speeds. A citywide 20 mph default is on the table. It saves lives. We lay out the steps here: <strong><a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a></strong>.</li></ul><p>The hours tick. The sirens come.</p><ul><li>In the last year, crashes rose 27% year‑to‑date. Injuries rose 80% year‑to‑date. Same streets.
