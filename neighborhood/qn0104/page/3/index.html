Amanda Servedio, 36, was hit and killed at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. The truck that struck her was fleeing police. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet.

Her father spoke for every parent who has waited for justice: &ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood, and we were very upset that that&rsquo;s what actually happened&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>he told the Daily News</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>154 people were injured and 3 suffered serious injuries</strong> in this district.

The street did not forgive. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>Police charged the driver</a> with reckless endangerment and reckless driving.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have not been silent.</strong> Council Member Tiffany Cabán has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking—measures that put people before cars. State Senator Michael Gianaris voted for &ldquo;complete streets&rdquo; design and called for stronger penalties for repeat reckless drivers. But the pace is slow.

The poll, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found deep worry among women, seniors, and Bronx residents. The matter summary reads: '77% of NYC voters consider pedestrian safety a serious issue.' Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death. The poll signals a mandate: fix the streets, protect the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.

The city listens.</p><p class=mb3>On April 8, 2025, Data for Progress released a poll showing 72 percent of New York City voters support 'fully subsidizing public transportation so that residents can use MTA bus services for free.' The poll surveyed 854 likely voters. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, who has championed free bus service since 2020, celebrated the results, saying, 'We know from our historic pilot program that free buses work: more riders, safer trips, cleaner air.' The MTA previously ran free bus pilots, reporting increased ridership and fewer operator assaults, though the agency questioned whether new riders joined. Danielle Deiseroth, Executive Director of Data for Progress, noted, 'People love free stuff.' The poll’s strong bipartisan support signals growing momentum for fare-free transit.

The crackdown targets the wrong people.</p><p class=mb3>On March 11, 2025, former Governor and mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo announced support for a Council Republican plan to require licensing and registration for all e-bikes and e-scooters, echoing Council Member Bob Holden's Intro 606. Cuomo called for a new city bureaucracy and stricter enforcement, saying, 'There’s virtually no rules and no regulations regarding e-bike use in New York City and too many New Yorkers are getting hurt, and even killed.' At a campaign event, Cuomo called bike lanes 'crazy.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani criticized the plan, warning it would 'increase unwarranted police stops and create a bureaucratic nightmare.' Comptroller Brad Lander said Cuomo's proposal 'puts his failure to govern on the backs of delivery workers.' Safety experts and advocates argue the plan would not improve safety, but instead target delivery workers—many undocumented—while cars and trucks remain the main source of road violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
