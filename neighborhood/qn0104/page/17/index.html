The incident, which killed 74-year-old Be Tran at Myrtle and Seneca Avenues, triggered public outcry. Gianaris criticized the city’s process, saying, 'They have to wait until that happens to get the score high enough to realize that an intersection needs protection.' He joined activists from the Ridgewood Tenants Union and Transportation Alternatives, demanding new signals and better street design. Gianaris said he contacted the Department of Transportation a year earlier with no result. The city claims over 20 traffic control approvals in Ridgewood, but residents and advocates say it’s not enough.

Holden (primary sponsor), Ari Kagan, Justin L. Brannan, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Sandy Nurse, Kalman Yeger, Rita C. Joseph, and Tiffany Cabán sponsored the bill.
