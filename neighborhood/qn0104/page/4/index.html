Amanda Servedio, 36, was hit and killed at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. The truck that struck her was fleeing police. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet.

Her father spoke for every parent who has waited for justice: &ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood, and we were very upset that that&rsquo;s what actually happened&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>he told the Daily News</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>154 people were injured and 3 suffered serious injuries</strong> in this district.

The street did not forgive. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>Police charged the driver</a> with reckless endangerment and reckless driving.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have not been silent.</strong> Council Member Tiffany Cabán has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking—measures that put people before cars. State Senator Michael Gianaris voted for &ldquo;complete streets&rdquo; design and called for stronger penalties for repeat reckless drivers. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment.
