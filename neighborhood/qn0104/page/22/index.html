Six serious injuries. Over 550 hurt.</strong> That is the price paid on the streets of Astoria (East)-Woodside (North) since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are bodies broken, lives changed. A 17-year-old girl, struck by a bike, left with deep cuts on her leg. A baby, a mother, a man on a moped—all marked by the violence of the street. No one is spared. Not the young. Not the old.</p><h3 id=recent-wounds-unhealed>Recent Wounds, Unhealed</h3><p>In the last year, <strong>three people suffered injuries so severe they may never heal</strong>. One was a child. There have been no deaths this year, but last year a life was lost. The pain does not fade. The crashes keep coming. <strong>Cars and SUVs hit hardest</strong>, but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all draw blood. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-silence>Leaders: Action and Silence</h3><p>Local leaders have not been silent. <strong>Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas and Council Member Tiffany Cabán backed protected bike lanes on 31st Street</strong>, writing that the plan would <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>&ldquo;protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested&rdquo;</a>. State Senator Michael Gianaris welcomed the long-delayed split of bike and pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge, saying, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-completes-long-stalled-plan-to-separate-bikes-and-pedestrians-on-queensboro-bridge>&ldquo;After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [DOT] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths&rdquo;</a>. But the work is not done. The street still wounds. The street still kills.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not fate.</strong> Every day without change is a day closer to the next siren. Call your council member. Demand safer streets. Demand action, not words. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

This follows a state bill signed last year mandating better conditions for cyclists. The plan, still in development, aims to create 'equitable access to the transit system and support sustainable transportation modes.' MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber said, 'We want to improve customer access to our environmentally friendly MTA services, however they get to their train or bus.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas called bridge access 'a matter of environmental justice, public health, and labor justice.' The MTA has ended bike permits on LIRR and Metro-North and added bike parking at Grand Central, but its record on bike access remains mixed. The agency is now seeking public comment and has hired Sam Schwartz Engineering to help shape the plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
