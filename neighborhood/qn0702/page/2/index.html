The white Toyota sedan hit an underpass near 225th Street around 3:50 a.m. Both occupants were found outside the wreck when police arrived. Investigators are unsure who was driving at the time of impact: 'Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven't figured out who was driving, police said.' The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive. The article highlights ongoing uncertainty about driver identity and underscores the persistent risks on city highways, especially where loss of vehicle control leads to deadly outcomes.

The NYPD and Sanitation Department have removed some ghost plates, but enforcement remains patchy. Placard abuse and fake plates let drivers dodge tolls and traffic laws, eroding the policy’s impact.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1142-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced December 19, 2024. The bill is titled, "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing child with autism warning plaques on streets." Council Member Kevin C. Riley is the primary sponsor, joined by Ariola, Joseph, Moya, Won, Banks, Narcisse, Paladino, and Marmorato. Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children. The city continues to rely on signage, not street redesign, to address systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight is far from over.</p><p class=mb3>On December 11, 2024, the City Council held a hearing on a bill to require city-level licensing and registration for e-bikes and e-scooters not covered by state law. The bill, sponsored by Councilmember Bob Holden, claims to address 'the proliferation of these vehicles' and their impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety. Councilmember Vickie Paladino, District 19, insisted, 'This is a safety issue.' Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez countered, 'We agree with the intent, but we believe that mandating registration and licensing is not a solution.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams warned the bill would 'have a disparate impact on low-income individuals, people of color, and undocumented migrants.' A separate resolution from Councilmember Gale Brewer supports licensing only for commercial e-bikes. The hearing exposed deep rifts over enforcement, equity, and the real sources of street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On December 10, 2024, Manhattan Community Board 2’s transportation and parks committees reviewed Council Member Vickie Paladino’s proposal to ban e-bikes from city parks. The committees voted overwhelmingly against it. The matter, described as an effort to 'make it more harmonious and safer for people in parks,' was criticized as 'not fleshed out.' Paladino, a Queens Republican, failed to provide data or address existing rules. Co-sponsor Gale Brewer admitted she signed on under pressure and doubted enforcement. Committee members Shirley Secunda, Susanna Aaron, Janet Liff, and Jeannine Kiely all voiced strong opposition, calling the bill redundant and inadequate. The Central Park Conservancy declined to endorse a ban, urging more protected bike lanes instead. The board found the proposal did nothing for safety and ignored systemic issues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics, including Michael Sisitzky of NYCLU and Luis Cortes of Los Deliveristas Unidos, warn the bill will lead to discriminatory policing and criminalize delivery workers.
