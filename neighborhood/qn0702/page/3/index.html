The injured carry the story in scars and limps. In the last twelve months alone, 108 people were hurt in 165 crashes. Six of those injuries were serious.

No child should bleed in the street. The old are not safe either. Eight people over 75 were hurt. Cars and trucks did the most damage.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.

However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas.

The incident occurred at 8:51 a.m. The report states the van’s brakes were defective, causing it to move unexpectedly and strike the man. The narrative describes the van as having 'failed brakes' and details how it 'crushed a 26-year-old man’s legs.' The victim remained conscious on the pavement, bleeding. Two parked vehicles—a van and an SUV—were involved, but only the van moved. The police report lists 'Brakes Defective' as the primary contributing factor. No driver errors beyond mechanical failure are cited. The report does not attribute any contributing actions to the pedestrian. The focus remains on the van’s mechanical failure and the resulting harm to the pedestrian.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Current caps let companies treat tickets as business costs. Streets fill with trucks. Residents lose space. The city wants power to set real deterrents. Albany holds the key.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0449-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced June 6, 2024, it urges the State Legislature to let cities raise the cap on commercial overnight parking fines. The matter title reads: "Resolution calling on the State legislature to increase the cap on commercial overnight fines for cities." Council Members Eric Dinowitz (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, and Robert F. Holden back the measure. They argue that capped fines are too low—companies absorb them, streets clog with trucks, and residents pay the price. The Council wants authority to set fines that actually deter illegal parking. The resolution points to nearly 27,000 complaints in 2021 and notes that current enforcement tools are weak. The bill is still in committee, awaiting further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
