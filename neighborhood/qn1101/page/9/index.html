Since 2022, six people have died on its streets. Five were women. One was a cyclist, struck by an SUV just last week at Hollis Court Boulevard and 50th Avenue. She was 55. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/two-dead-in-separate-nyc-electric-vehicle-crashes-cops/>Police are still investigating the crash.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, 197 people were hurt in 351 crashes. One did not come home. Most were walking, biking, or just trying to cross. The numbers do not flinch. They do not heal.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The old and the young fall hardest. In three years, 45 children and 64 seniors have been injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. The dead do not get a second chance. The living get scars.</p><p>A 75-year-old woman was killed crossing 192nd Street. The record says &ldquo;driver inattention.&rdquo; The street says nothing. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The record says nothing about her name.</a></p><h2 id=leadership-words-and-votes>Leadership: Words and Votes</h2><p>Local leaders have moved, but not enough. State Senator John Liu voted yes to curb repeat speeders, backing a bill to force speed-limiting tech on drivers who rack up violations. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted yes in committee.</a> Council Member Vickie Paladino cheered new car-free school streets, calling it a win for children. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>She called it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play.</a></p><p>But the streets are still fast. The deaths are still coming. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The law is there. The will is not.</p><h2 id=act-or-wait-for-the-next-siren>Act or Wait for the Next Siren</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, redesign the streets, and stop the next crash before it happens. The dead cannot speak.

The park’s greenway, a lifeline for cyclists, now stands exposed and wounded.</p><p class=mb3>On April 6, 2024, vandals ripped out 300 young trees near the Kissena Park Greenway in Queens. The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, left the area between Four Winds Playground and the Kissena Velodrome stripped and scarred. The Kissena Park Connector, part of the Destination Greenways plan, is a vital east-west bike route. Volunteers, who planted the saplings since 2022, found ATV tracks at the scene. Council Member Sandra Ung, a supporter of the greenway and volunteer efforts, urged witnesses to report vandalism. She told NY1, 'Anyone witnessing any vandalism should report it.' The NYPD and Parks Department have investigated but offered no comment. The destruction leaves greenway users—cyclists and pedestrians—more exposed, stripping away natural protection and undermining years of community effort.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets should shelter people, not heavy traffic.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0114-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on February 28, 2024. The bill orders the Department of Transportation to report on 'the utility and feasibility of using street design as a means to limit or reduce the use by commercial vehicles of streets in residential neighborhoods.' Jennifer Gutiérrez leads as primary sponsor, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate, and others. The bill was referred to committee on the day of introduction. It demands a clear look at how design can push trucks off streets where people walk, bike, and live.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bill sets fines. Ten-day grace for expired tags. Crackdown aims at cars that dodge law and endanger streets. Committee on Public Safety holds the measure.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0177-2024 sits in the Committee on Public Safety after introduction on February 28, 2024. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...prohibiting the operation of a motor vehicle with fraudulent or expired license plates,' makes it illegal to drive with fake or expired plates, including temporary ones. Civil penalties apply, but drivers with expired plates get a 10-day cure period. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Feliz, Salamanca, Powers, Restler, Won, Brewer, Schulman, Ung, Marte, Hudson, Avilés, De La Rosa, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets drivers who hide behind illegal plates, a tactic often linked to hit-and-runs and reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced February 28, 2024, by Council Members Louis (primary), Carr, Ung, Holden, Ariola, Paladino, and Morano. The bill orders DOT to assess at least 100 speed camera locations each year for raised speed reducer feasibility. If feasible, DOT must install the bump within a year. The law demands annual reports on these checks and on shifts in dangerous driving at treated sites. The bill summary reads: 'requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' Council aims to force physical changes where cameras alone fail.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
