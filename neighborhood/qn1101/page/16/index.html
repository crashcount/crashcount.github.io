Since 2022, six people have died on its streets. Five were women. One was a cyclist, struck by an SUV just last week at Hollis Court Boulevard and 50th Avenue. She was 55. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/two-dead-in-separate-nyc-electric-vehicle-crashes-cops/>Police are still investigating the crash.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, 197 people were hurt in 351 crashes. One did not come home. Most were walking, biking, or just trying to cross. The numbers do not flinch. They do not heal.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The old and the young fall hardest. In three years, 45 children and 64 seniors have been injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. The dead do not get a second chance. The living get scars.</p><p>A 75-year-old woman was killed crossing 192nd Street. The record says &ldquo;driver inattention.&rdquo; The street says nothing. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The record says nothing about her name.</a></p><h2 id=leadership-words-and-votes>Leadership: Words and Votes</h2><p>Local leaders have moved, but not enough. State Senator John Liu voted yes to curb repeat speeders, backing a bill to force speed-limiting tech on drivers who rack up violations. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted yes in committee.</a> Council Member Vickie Paladino cheered new car-free school streets, calling it a win for children. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>She called it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play.</a></p><p>But the streets are still fast. The deaths are still coming. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The law is there. The will is not.</p><h2 id=act-or-wait-for-the-next-siren>Act or Wait for the Next Siren</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, redesign the streets, and stop the next crash before it happens. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Danger and delay linger.</p><p class=mb3>This action concerns the long-delayed Queens Greenway, discussed in a public statement on February 17, 2022. The project, first planned in 1977 and 1988, would connect Flushing Meadows Corona Park to Fort Totten with a safe route for pedestrians and cyclists. The Parks Department and DOT presented a new vision but admitted that none of the $105 million needed is funded. Council Member Sandra Ung, representing parts of the greenway, said, 'I want to finally see it become a reality,' and stressed the need for accessible open spaces. Still, she could not commit any specific funding. Cycling advocates criticized the city for asking residents to pick favorite sub-projects, calling it a tactic to lower expectations. The city offered no timeline. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the greenway languishes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
