Six seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, Auburndale’s streets have claimed lives both young and old. A 75-year-old woman, crossing 192nd Street, was struck and killed by a sedan. A 19-year-old, crossing with the signal on Utopia Parkway, was struck and injured by a car. A 40-year-old woman, a 30-year-old man, a 72-year-old driver—each lost in crashes that left families with empty chairs and silent phones. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Nearly 500 injured.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. In the last twelve months alone, 165 people were hurt in 265 crashes. No one was spared: children, elders, cyclists, drivers. The pain is spread wide, but it lands hardest on those with the least protection.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Sedans and SUVs killed or seriously injured more pedestrians than any other vehicle. Trucks and buses are rare, but when they hit, the damage is deep. Bikes and motorcycles did not kill here, but the threat is always present. The street is a gauntlet, and the odds are not in your favor if you walk or ride.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Speed cameras, proven to cut speeding and injuries, are in place but need reauthorization. Yet the pace is slow. The law is there. The power is there. The will is not always there. Each day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who set the rules and draw the lines. The blood on the street is not washed away by words.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras.

Council Members Eric Dinowitz (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, and Robert F. Holden back the measure. They argue that capped fines are too low—companies absorb them, streets clog with trucks, and residents pay the price. The Council wants authority to set fines that actually deter illegal parking. The resolution points to nearly 27,000 complaints in 2021 and notes that current enforcement tools are weak.

Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends.

The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, left the area between Four Winds Playground and the Kissena Velodrome stripped and scarred. The Kissena Park Connector, part of the Destination Greenways plan, is a vital east-west bike route. Volunteers, who planted the saplings since 2022, found ATV tracks at the scene. Council Member Sandra Ung, a supporter of the greenway and volunteer efforts, urged witnesses to report vandalism. She told NY1, 'Anyone witnessing any vandalism should report it.' The NYPD and Parks Department have investigated but offered no comment. The destruction leaves greenway users—cyclists and pedestrians—more exposed, stripping away natural protection and undermining years of community effort.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bill slaps fines and jail time on drivers who cover or deface tags. No more hiding from cameras. Law aims to strip shields from reckless motorists. Committee weighs next steps. Streets demand accountability.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0766-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced April 11, 2024, the bill bans parking, standing, stopping, or operating a vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the parking, standing, stopping, or operation of a motor vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates.' Council Member Oswald Feliz leads as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Bottcher, Gennaro, Marte, Restler, Ung, and Paladino. The bill hits violators with up to $1,000 fines, possible jail, and escalating penalties for repeat offenses. The measure aims to end the dodge—drivers hiding plates to evade enforcement. The committee now holds the bill for review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
