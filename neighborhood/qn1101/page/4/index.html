Six seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, Auburndale’s streets have claimed lives both young and old. A 75-year-old woman, crossing 192nd Street, was struck and killed by a sedan. A 19-year-old, crossing with the signal on Utopia Parkway, was struck and injured by a car. A 40-year-old woman, a 30-year-old man, a 72-year-old driver—each lost in crashes that left families with empty chairs and silent phones. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Nearly 500 injured.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. In the last twelve months alone, 165 people were hurt in 265 crashes. No one was spared: children, elders, cyclists, drivers. The pain is spread wide, but it lands hardest on those with the least protection.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Sedans and SUVs killed or seriously injured more pedestrians than any other vehicle. Trucks and buses are rare, but when they hit, the damage is deep. Bikes and motorcycles did not kill here, but the threat is always present. The street is a gauntlet, and the odds are not in your favor if you walk or ride.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Speed cameras, proven to cut speeding and injuries, are in place but need reauthorization. Yet the pace is slow. The law is there. The power is there. The will is not always there. Each day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who set the rules and draw the lines. The blood on the street is not washed away by words.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
