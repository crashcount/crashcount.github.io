Six seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, Auburndale’s streets have claimed lives both young and old. A 75-year-old woman, crossing 192nd Street, was struck and killed by a sedan. A 19-year-old, crossing with the signal on Utopia Parkway, was struck and injured by a car. A 40-year-old woman, a 30-year-old man, a 72-year-old driver—each lost in crashes that left families with empty chairs and silent phones. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>Nearly 500 injured.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. In the last twelve months alone, 165 people were hurt in 265 crashes. No one was spared: children, elders, cyclists, drivers. The pain is spread wide, but it lands hardest on those with the least protection.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Sedans and SUVs killed or seriously injured more pedestrians than any other vehicle. Trucks and buses are rare, but when they hit, the damage is deep. Bikes and motorcycles did not kill here, but the threat is always present. The street is a gauntlet, and the odds are not in your favor if you walk or ride.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Speed cameras, proven to cut speeding and injuries, are in place but need reauthorization. Yet the pace is slow. The law is there. The power is there. The will is not always there. Each day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who set the rules and draw the lines. The blood on the street is not washed away by words.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Hypocrisy, exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2023, Council Member Vickie Paladino was implicated in a scandal involving a fraudulent Arizona temporary license plate found on her son’s luxury car, parked in her driveway. Paladino has co-sponsored two pending Council bills to increase fines for fake tags and has publicly decried unregistered vehicles, stating, 'The only solution to this, of course, is old-fashioned law enforcement.' Despite her tough stance, photographs showed the car with the fake tag on public streets. Paladino claimed the tag was merely expired, but Arizona authorities confirmed it was a forgery. Her son denied knowledge of the fake tag. Paladino’s actions highlight a stark contradiction between her legislative efforts and her family’s conduct.

The announcement, made at One Police Plaza, highlighted the bill sponsored by Simon and Sen. John Liu. The matter summary states, 'Officials called on Albany to pass legislation to lower the BAC threshold to .05%, arguing it would reduce DWI fatalities by about 10% and align with other countries.' Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany.

Ben Turner, a Bayside resident, challenges Council Member Vickie Paladino’s opposition, arguing she misrepresents her district. Turner writes, 'Congestion pricing is a step in the right direction for northeastern Queens.' He claims most commuters use public transit, while drivers into Manhattan are wealthier. Turner highlights the toll of car dominance: traffic, slow buses, pedestrian fatalities, and childhood asthma. He insists that reducing car use will free up space, improve safety, and boost quality of life. Turner’s stance: congestion pricing is vital for safer, healthier streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Doug Gordon, writing in Streetsblog NYC, systematically rebuts Paladino’s claims, stating, “Everything Paladino proposes here is unserious, doesn’t exist in any city that has successfully integrated cycling into its transportation system and has been thoroughly debunked going back years.” Gordon cites polling and Department of Transportation data to show broad support for protected bike lanes and the effectiveness of speed cameras. He challenges Paladino’s push for cyclist licensing and increased law enforcement, urging her to listen to transportation experts and everyday New Yorkers.

The message: don’t drink and drive.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2023, Queens State Senator John Liu, representing District 16, publicly supported a bill in the State Legislature to lower the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for drivers from 0.08 to 0.05. The bill’s summary states, 'The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.' Liu, as the bill’s primary sponsor, emphasized that anyone found with a BAC over 0.05 would be charged with DWI. City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez joined the push, warning, 'Whether they are at 0.06 or 0.12 or 0.20, the consequences can be deadly.' Drunk driving caused 307 deaths in New York State in 2019, nearly a third of all fatal crashes. Utah’s adoption of a 0.05 BAC limit led to a 20% drop in fatal crashes in its first year. The bill is part of a broader effort to protect pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She opposes congestion pricing, speed cameras, and the expansion of bike lanes and open streets. Paladino supports speed bumps, raised crossings, and increased NYPD traffic enforcement. She calls for licensing, registration, and insurance for cyclists. Paladino also urges more investment in public transit and a full MTA audit.
