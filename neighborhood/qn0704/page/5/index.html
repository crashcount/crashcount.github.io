Six left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In Murray Hill-Broadway Flushing, the years since 2022 have been marked by the steady grind of crashes. <strong>808 crashes. 452 people hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers. Each is a body on the pavement, a family waiting by a hospital bed. No one under 18 has died, but children are not spared: <strong>19 injured in the last year alone</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a>).</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and the old bear the brunt.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and sedans have killed four people and seriously injured five more. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Cyclists are struck, arms broken, lives upended. The elderly are hit crossing the street. A child is struck in a crosswalk. The pattern is clear. The pain is not spread evenly.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They tout speed cameras and lower speed limits. But in this district, the carnage continues. <strong>&ldquo;They accelerated toward the cops, nearly striking them,&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/06/us-news/nypd-cop-fires-at-armed-bmw-thieves-who-tried-to-mow-down-officers-during-heist-from-queens-shop-cops/>reported the New York Post</a>). Cars used as weapons. Streets used as escape routes. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The city has the tools to redesign streets. But the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. The city can act. The council can act. You can act. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city use every tool it has—now.

The city adds more car-free zones for kids. Streets once deadly will now be safer for walking, play, and learning. The move targets neighborhoods hit hardest by crashes.</p><p class=mb3>On August 29, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a record 71 school streets will close to cars this fall. The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In a letter to MTA CEO Janno Lieber, Liu wrote, 'I demand the MTA explain how this plan is overall an increase and expansion of bus service in Queens as opposed to an actually disguised cost reduction measure.' Liu highlighted the planned elimination of the QM3 bus and reductions to the QM5, warning of increased wait times and higher fares for commuters. He argued that rerouting and service cuts would isolate seniors, strand students, and hurt businesses. Liu’s stance: the redesign prioritizes cost-cutting over real improvements. The MTA insists the plan means more and faster service, but Liu and local riders remain unconvinced.

Council Member Sandra Ung has prioritized funding for her district’s portion, stating, 'I am proud that today nearly the entire greenway through District 20 is fully funded.' Advocates like John Kelly and Joby Jacob push for transparency and urgency, warning, 'Now is the time to ensure that this great work isn't watered down or indefinitely delayed.'

John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0928-2024, introduced May 23, 2024, sits 'Laid Over in Committee' at the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill orders the Department of Transportation, with Health and Mental Hygiene, to run a pilot project testing cool pavement—materials that lower street temperatures—across at least four neighborhoods facing heat and disadvantage. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law in relation to requiring the department of transportation to conduct a pilot project on the use of cool pavement.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by 29 co-sponsors. The bill requires DOT to report findings to the Mayor and Council. Safety analysts note no direct effect on vulnerable road users: the measure targets heat, not traffic violence. The city’s most dangerous streets remain unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sits in committee, awaiting further action. Senator Michelle Hinchey (District 41) sponsored the measure. The bill summary states: 'Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Kingston; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2029.' Votes in both chambers showed strong support, with some opposition. The program targets reckless driving near schools, aiming to protect children and other vulnerable road users from speeding cars. The demonstration will run until the end of 2029, testing the impact of automated enforcement in Kingston.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A child, a young man, two moped riders, and another victim. Councilmember Vickie Paladino calls for debate, not action. City lags on protected lanes. Advocates say the toll is rising. Streets remain deadly for the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On May 20, 2024, Councilmember Vickie Paladino (District 19) was mentioned in a public debate following a deadly weekend on Queens streets. The event, covered by Gothamist, highlighted that 2024 is one of the deadliest years for Queens since Vision Zero began. The matter summary states, 'Five people were killed by cars over the weekend.' Paladino criticized DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and street safety advocates, calling for a 'robust, inclusive debate.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's failure to meet the 2019 NYC Streets Plan, which mandates 50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. The city has built only 72% of required bike lanes and 19% of bus lanes. Advocates point to rising deaths, especially among children, and blame delays and opposition from local officials. The debate underscores a systemic failure to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
