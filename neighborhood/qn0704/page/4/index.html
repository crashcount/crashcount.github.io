Six left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In Murray Hill-Broadway Flushing, the years since 2022 have been marked by the steady grind of crashes. <strong>808 crashes. 452 people hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers. Each is a body on the pavement, a family waiting by a hospital bed. No one under 18 has died, but children are not spared: <strong>19 injured in the last year alone</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a>).</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and the old bear the brunt.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and sedans have killed four people and seriously injured five more. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Cyclists are struck, arms broken, lives upended. The elderly are hit crossing the street. A child is struck in a crosswalk. The pattern is clear. The pain is not spread evenly.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They tout speed cameras and lower speed limits. But in this district, the carnage continues. <strong>&ldquo;They accelerated toward the cops, nearly striking them,&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/06/us-news/nypd-cop-fires-at-armed-bmw-thieves-who-tried-to-mow-down-officers-during-heist-from-queens-shop-cops/>reported the New York Post</a>). Cars used as weapons. Streets used as escape routes. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The city has the tools to redesign streets. But the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. The city can act. The council can act. You can act. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city use every tool it has—now.

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Erik Bottcher (District 3), passed through committee and aims to address neglected, broken, and obstructive newspaper boxes. The bill summary states it will 'establish clear guidelines and help ensure that our local publications get to maintain their newsracks while also helping to alleviate sidewalk congestion.' Bottcher’s action brings new requirements: owners must display contact information, and the Department of Transportation gains authority to set size, shape, and material standards. Sandra Ung, another council member, noted that without oversight, newsracks become a blight. The law seeks to reduce sidewalk clutter, making streets less hazardous for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No formal bill number or committee is cited, but the shift signals momentum.

However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas.

The city adds more car-free zones for kids. Streets once deadly will now be safer for walking, play, and learning. The move targets neighborhoods hit hardest by crashes.</p><p class=mb3>On August 29, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a record 71 school streets will close to cars this fall. The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
