Four serious injuries. 391 people hurt.</strong> That’s Glendale since 2022. The numbers come slow, but they never stop. Each one is a body broken or a life ended. Each one is a family changed forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> Fourteen kids have been injured in the last year alone.

Six pedestrians struck by SUVs, sedans, bikes, buses, trucks—they all play their part.

No bold moves.</strong> The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passes bills. But in Glendale, the pace is slow. The danger is fast. There is no sign of a local leader standing up, demanding more for the people who walk and ride here. There is no record of a council member or board chair calling for protected bike lanes, slower speeds, or more enforcement. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Demand action.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them you want streets where a child can cross without fear. Tell them you want fewer funerals and more safe journeys. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Each stop now gets logged with the reason, time, and outcome. No names. Just facts. The city posts these reports online. A move for sunlight. No more secrets.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0781-2022, now law, came through the Committee on Public Safety. The Council passed it on January 20, 2024. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the police department to report on the justification for the stop in vehicle encounter reports," demands the NYPD document every vehicle stop. Reports must include the reason for the stop, the level of offense, and demographic details, but no personal identifiers. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and others led the charge. The law aims to expose patterns in police stops and holds officers to account. Reports go online, open to all. This is a step toward transparency, not just for drivers, but for every New Yorker who walks, rides, or waits at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say it targets delivery workers, mostly immigrants and people of color. The bill would hand police more power to stop, fine, and harass riders. The city’s most vulnerable would pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On December 20, 2023, Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30) published an op-ed opposing his own bill to require registration and licensing for e-bikes and e-scooters. The bill, introduced in the New York City Council, would impact the city’s 65,000 app-based delivery workers. The op-ed warns: 'What might sound benign at first would actually lead to a substantial increase in state surveillance and regulation of New York City's 65,000 app-based delivery workers.' Holden’s action—introducing the bill—has drawn sharp criticism for enabling more NYPD stops and fines, especially against Black, Latine, and immigrant riders. The piece details how similar enforcement has led to racial profiling and financial hardship for those least able to bear it. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the op-ed makes clear: more policing means more danger for the city’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30) supported raising fines for drivers using fake or obscured plates. The matter, reported by Gothamist, highlights a surge in 'ghost cars'—vehicles with covered, defaced, or phony plates—dodging tolls and speed cameras. Holden stated, "If somebody can save a lot of money by obscuring their plates, they'll do it." The NYPD has increased enforcement, but many offenders remain undeterred. Advocates and experts, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, warn that without strict enforcement, congestion pricing goals and street safety will suffer. The city has banned camera-blocking covers and encourages public reporting, but unresolved complaints and repeat violations persist. Holden's push aims to make penalties outweigh the savings from toll evasion, seeking legislative action to protect the program's integrity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill summary states it would require 'license plates and vehicle registrations for any electric bike, scooter or other motorized vehicle.' At a City Hall rally, Holden and supporters pointed to injuries and deaths from lithium-ion battery fires. Pamela Manasse, a crash survivor, called e-vehicles a danger. Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives criticized the bill, saying it shifts blame from drivers and ignores the need for safer street design and better regulation of e-bike sales and batteries.

The bill orders daylighting at intersections and new signage. It aims to cut crashes, boost visibility, and shrink truck miles. Sponsors demand safer streets for people on foot and bike. Change is now law.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0708-2022, now Local Law 171 of 2023, was enacted by the City Council on December 16, 2023, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, before the Transportation Committee, would require licensing and visible plates for all e-bikes, scooters, and legal motorized vehicles not already registered with the DMV. The board opposed the measure, passing a resolution 21-15 (with five abstentions), calling it 'overly broad and ineffective at addressing safety concerns.' The matter summary reads: 'Require registration and licensing for all e-bikes and legal motorized vehicles.' Board members Brian Van Nieuwenhoven and Jason Froimowitz criticized the bill as incomplete and unrealistic, noting it would not solve dangerous operation or enforcement issues. Holden dismissed the board’s opposition as unrepresentative. The board also passed a separate resolution supporting daylighting at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary: 'New York's street sweepers should have cameras to ticket car owners who flout the city's alternate-side parking rules.' Holden said, 'Our goal is not to punish.
