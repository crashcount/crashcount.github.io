Four serious injuries. 391 people hurt.</strong> That’s Glendale since 2022. The numbers come slow, but they never stop. Each one is a body broken or a life ended. Each one is a family changed forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> Fourteen kids have been injured in the last year alone. One child died. The street does not care how old you are. The street takes what it wants.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-the-danger>The Shape of the Danger</h3><p><strong>SUVs lead the charge.</strong> They hit, they injure, they kill. Six pedestrians struck by SUVs, sedans, bikes, buses, trucks—they all play their part. But the big cars do the most harm. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the numbers</a>.</p><p><strong>Cyclists bleed too.</strong> A 46-year-old man crushed by a car passing too close.

The road is not safe for those who move without steel around them.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No bold moves.</strong> The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passes bills. But in Glendale, the pace is slow. The danger is fast. There is no sign of a local leader standing up, demanding more for the people who walk and ride here. There is no record of a council member or board chair calling for protected bike lanes, slower speeds, or more enforcement. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Demand action.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them you want streets where a child can cross without fear.

The piece, titled 'Sen. Gianaris’ latest ‘bust the MTA’ budget idiocy,' appeared in the New York Post. It claims the plan would add $638 million a year to the MTA’s deficits and criticizes the idea as reckless. Gianaris, along with Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, is called out for joining the push. The editorial’s focus is fiscal: 'making all city buses free by 2026... would add an estimated $638 million a year to the MTA’s multi-billion dollar deficits.' There is no assessment of how this policy would affect vulnerable road users.

The plan, part of the larger Fix The MTA Package, would phase in free local and Select Bus Service, increase bus frequency by 20%, freeze fares, and expand permanent bus lane camera enforcement. Funding would rise from $200 million in 2023 to $638 million in 2026, with $488 million yearly for more buses and $300 million annually for frequent subways. Mamdani called the proposal 'urgent and necessary,' stressing that 'seniors, working class New Yorkers, people who use the bus the most are able to do so without fear of being priced out.' Gianaris said, 'incrementalism...is not working.' The lawmakers urge bold action to ensure public transit is accessible, affordable, and excellent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sponsors raise concerns about pollution, health, and traffic impacts on outer-borough communities. The measure questions whether congestion pricing will cut traffic or fund transit improvements.

The bill, non-binding and currently under committee review, seeks to revive 3.5 miles of the former Rockaway Beach Branch, extending the M train from Rego Park to the Rockaways. The matter title calls for 'a deeper study of the QueensLink proposal to reactivate an old rail line.' Ariola and Brooks-Powers, both representing southeastern Queens, argue the project would benefit communities with poor subway access and reduce car dependency. Ariola stated, 'I think it’s necessary and I think that it would really benefit the communities.' Brooks-Powers emphasized the resolution as a priority for the Transportation Committee. The push comes as Mayor Adams advances the QueensWay park plan, raising concerns among transit advocates. The MTA says a new study is unnecessary, but supporters insist a thorough review is needed before converting the corridor to parkland.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
