Four serious injuries. 391 people hurt.</strong> That’s Glendale since 2022. The numbers come slow, but they never stop. Each one is a body broken or a life ended. Each one is a family changed forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> Fourteen kids have been injured in the last year alone. One child died. The street does not care how old you are. The street takes what it wants.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-the-danger>The Shape of the Danger</h3><p><strong>SUVs lead the charge.</strong> They hit, they injure, they kill. Six pedestrians struck by SUVs, sedans, bikes, buses, trucks—they all play their part. But the big cars do the most harm. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the numbers</a>.</p><p><strong>Cyclists bleed too.</strong> A 46-year-old man crushed by a car passing too close. A 54-year-old thrown from his bike by a bus. The road is not safe for those who move without steel around them.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No bold moves.</strong> The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passes bills. But in Glendale, the pace is slow. The danger is fast. There is no sign of a local leader standing up, demanding more for the people who walk and ride here. There is no record of a council member or board chair calling for protected bike lanes, slower speeds, or more enforcement. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Demand action.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them you want streets where a child can cross without fear. Tell them you want fewer funerals and more safe journeys. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No relief in sight.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2022, Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) joined critics in a policy debate over New York City's stalled congestion pricing plan. The measure, approved by state lawmakers three years ago, would charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The MTA faces hundreds of follow-up questions from the Federal Highway Administration, delaying the required environmental assessment. Ariola argued, 'I don’t believe it will work, in fact I believe it will make the city more unmanageable to travel through.' The plan is intended to reduce traffic, lower car pollution, and fund MTA capital improvements. Delays put $1 billion in annual funding at risk, threatening upgrades like accessible subway stations and zero-emission buses. As the debate drags on, vulnerable road users remain exposed to traffic and pollution hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports.

The measure died in committee. No tickets, no deterrence. Buses and riders left exposed. Streets lose protection when traffic surges and rules go dark.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0170-2022 was introduced on April 14, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill proposed 'suspending bus lane enforcement on legal holidays.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, Joseph C. Borelli, and Inna Vernikov backed the measure. The bill required the Department of Transportation to stop using cameras to enforce bus lane rules during legal holidays. The legislation was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. With enforcement paused, bus lanes would have lost their shield. Riders and pedestrians would face more cars in bus lanes, more chaos, and less safety when streets are busiest. Vulnerable road users would have paid the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They want Far Rockaway and more LIRR stations in the fare program. The move aims to cut commute times and boost transit use. The bill is filed, not enacted.</p><p class=mb3>Res 0108-2022 was introduced on April 14, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution urges the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to 'expand and make permanent the Atlantic Ticket pilot in order to include Far Rockaway, and other stations along the LIRR corridor, in the fare affordability program.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Yeger, Stevens, Hanif, Bottcher, Krishnan, and many others. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. The Atlantic Ticket pilot, launched in 2018, gave Southeast Queens and Brooklyn riders cheaper LIRR fares. Advocates say expanding it citywide could mean faster, safer commutes and more transit riders. The council’s action highlights the need for affordable, accessible transit—especially for neighborhoods with long, punishing commutes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
