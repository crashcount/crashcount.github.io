Four serious injuries. 391 people hurt.</strong> That’s Glendale since 2022. The numbers come slow, but they never stop. Each one is a body broken or a life ended. Each one is a family changed forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> Fourteen kids have been injured in the last year alone. One child died. The street does not care how old you are. The street takes what it wants.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-the-danger>The Shape of the Danger</h3><p><strong>SUVs lead the charge.</strong> They hit, they injure, they kill. Six pedestrians struck by SUVs, sedans, bikes, buses, trucks—they all play their part. But the big cars do the most harm. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the numbers</a>.</p><p><strong>Cyclists bleed too.</strong> A 46-year-old man crushed by a car passing too close.

The road is not safe for those who move without steel around them.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No bold moves.</strong> The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passes bills. But in Glendale, the pace is slow. The danger is fast. There is no sign of a local leader standing up, demanding more for the people who walk and ride here. There is no record of a council member or board chair calling for protected bike lanes, slower speeds, or more enforcement. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Demand action.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them you want streets where a child can cross without fear.

The clash exposes tension between personal conduct and public pledges.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2022, Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30) publicly criticized Juan Ardila, candidate for the 37th Assembly District, over more than two dozen traffic and parking violations since 2019. The controversy centers on Ardila’s support for the Green New Deal, mass transit, expanded bike lanes, and reducing car culture—policies he has championed in public forums. Holden accused Ardila of hypocrisy, highlighting the gap between Ardila’s driving record and his policy positions. Despite this, StreetsPac, a safe streets advocacy group, endorsed Ardila, noting his support for 24/7 speed cameras and safer biking infrastructure. Ardila stated, 'We need to ensure that every New Yorker has the opportunity to bike and... reduce car culture within our communities.' The episode underscores the scrutiny faced by candidates who pledge to protect vulnerable road users while their personal actions draw criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Joann Ariola opposes the plan, claiming it will worsen city travel. Delays threaten $1 billion in MTA funding. Vulnerable road users wait as traffic and pollution persist. No relief in sight.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2022, Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) joined critics in a policy debate over New York City's stalled congestion pricing plan. The measure, approved by state lawmakers three years ago, would charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The MTA faces hundreds of follow-up questions from the Federal Highway Administration, delaying the required environmental assessment. Ariola argued, 'I don’t believe it will work, in fact I believe it will make the city more unmanageable to travel through.' The plan is intended to reduce traffic, lower car pollution, and fund MTA capital improvements. Delays put $1 billion in annual funding at risk, threatening upgrades like accessible subway stations and zero-emission buses. As the debate drags on, vulnerable road users remain exposed to traffic and pollution hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Kalman Yeger (primary), with Inna Vernikov, Joseph C. Borelli, Kevin C. Riley, Shaun Abreu, and Robert F. Holden as co-sponsors, was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The bill summary states: 'This bill would change the community board notification process for major transportation projects by defining the construction or removal of a bus lane, busway, or bike lane as a major transportation project, regardless of the number of consecutive blocks or consecutive feet of street that the project alters.' DOT would be required to notify and present plans to community boards, consider feedback, and post quarterly progress reports online. The bill aimed to increase transparency and community input on street changes that affect vulnerable road users, but did not become law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Status quo wins.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0253-2022 was introduced in the New York City Council on April 28, 2022. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting school bus parking on city streets overnight and on weekends,' aimed to stop school buses from parking on city streets between 5:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. on weekdays and all weekend. The measure was referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Sponsors included Justin L. Brannan (primary), Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, Sandy Nurse, and Marjorie Velázquez. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. School buses continue to occupy curb space overnight, leaving visibility and access issues for pedestrians and cyclists unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets lose protection when traffic surges and rules go dark.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0170-2022 was introduced on April 14, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill proposed 'suspending bus lane enforcement on legal holidays.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, Joseph C. Borelli, and Inna Vernikov backed the measure. The bill required the Department of Transportation to stop using cameras to enforce bus lane rules during legal holidays. The legislation was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. With enforcement paused, bus lanes would have lost their shield. Riders and pedestrians would face more cars in bus lanes, more chaos, and less safety when streets are busiest. Vulnerable road users would have paid the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
