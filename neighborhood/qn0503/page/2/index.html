Four serious injuries. 391 people hurt.</strong> That’s Glendale since 2022. The numbers come slow, but they never stop. Each one is a body broken or a life ended. Each one is a family changed forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> Fourteen kids have been injured in the last year alone. One child died. The street does not care how old you are. The street takes what it wants.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-the-danger>The Shape of the Danger</h3><p><strong>SUVs lead the charge.</strong> They hit, they injure, they kill. Six pedestrians struck by SUVs, sedans, bikes, buses, trucks—they all play their part. But the big cars do the most harm. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the numbers</a>.</p><p><strong>Cyclists bleed too.</strong> A 46-year-old man crushed by a car passing too close. A 54-year-old thrown from his bike by a bus. The road is not safe for those who move without steel around them.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No bold moves.</strong> The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passes bills. But in Glendale, the pace is slow. The danger is fast. There is no sign of a local leader standing up, demanding more for the people who walk and ride here. There is no record of a council member or board chair calling for protected bike lanes, slower speeds, or more enforcement. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Demand action.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them you want streets where a child can cross without fear. Tell them you want fewer funerals and more safe journeys. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On Woodhaven Boulevard, Rosen struck McField from behind, ran him over, and continued driving, dragging the motorcycle until it caught fire. Rosen then hit another car before stopping at a lamp post. McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes."

The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips.

The project sits finished. Cyclists and walkers still cram into a narrow, crash-prone lane. Delays keep thousands at risk. City Hall stalls. Advocates plan protest. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash injured three people: a 7-year-old girl with a broken femur and head injury, a 14-year-old girl with leg injuries, and a 58-year-old man with bruises. Police arrested Bah and charged her with 'reckless endangerment, reckless driving and driving without a license.'

Both cases highlight the risks posed by unlicensed driving and raise questions about enforcement and street design near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA demanded $4 billion from the city—a 33% jump from the last plan—warning of major subway disruptions if denied. The matter, titled 'MTA threatens another ‘Summer of Hell’ of subway disruptions if NYC doesn’t cough up billions,' drew sharp words. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Queens) blasted the agency: 'Instead of insulting us with baseless threats, the agency that spends $30 million on a staircase should find ways to cut its wasteful spending and bloated payroll before asking for more taxpayer money.' Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility. Despite heated criticism, council members did not strongly oppose the request in session. The hearing left the city’s most vulnerable riders—those who rely on safe, reliable transit—caught between political fights and crumbling infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
