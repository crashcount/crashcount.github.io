A cyclist crushed. In Flatbush (West)-Ditmas Park-Parkville, the numbers bleed into each other. <strong>Four people killed. 555 injured.</strong> In the last twelve months, a child died. Two others were left with serious injuries. The old and the young, no one spared.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks did the most damage.</strong> Two deaths, 27 moderate injuries, three serious injuries. Cars and trucks keep rolling. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=intersections-where-lives-end>Intersections: Where Lives End</h3><p>Most deaths come at the corners. Sightlines blocked, turns too fast, a moment’s inattention. The city knows this. Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections. Now, at last, the city moves. Barriers, granite blocks, planters—<strong>hard daylighting</strong>—are coming to corners where crashes pile up. &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,&rdquo; said <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city will start with high-crash spots like Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. It’s a start. Not enough.</p><p>Advocates want more. &ldquo;Anything with real (not plastic) infrastructure in street corners is good news,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>Jon Orcutt</a>. But the pace is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The numbers say otherwise. In the last year, <strong>crashes and injuries rose</strong>. The city touts new designs, but the work is piecemeal. No word from local council or state reps on speeding up the rollout or demanding more. No public fight for more barriers, more daylight, fewer deaths.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-faster>What Now: Demand More, Demand Faster</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand hard barriers at every deadly corner. Demand speed limits that save lives. Demand action before another child’s name becomes a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement.

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg), would apply from this year through 2028. The matter summary states the bill 'emphasizes the need for more protected bike lanes to make streets safer and increase cycling.' Joseph leads the legislation; Restler supports. The Department of Transportation failed to meet even the lower 30-mile requirement in 2022, building only 26.3 miles. DOT faces staffing shortages and budget gaps. Advocates warn that enforcement and maintenance lag, and that blocked lanes remain a threat. Joseph’s district ranks low in protected bike lane coverage, despite high rates of walking, biking, and transit use. The bill sits before the Council, with DOT reviewing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, states the state DOT will only provide technical help to the city’s study of the 1.5-mile city-owned segment between Atlantic Avenue and Sands Street. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the state’s lack of engagement: 'The state hasn't engaged in any way shape or form.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said her community wants the BQE 'revisioned and totally changed,' citing environmental and health impacts. Assembly Member Robert Carroll warned that lack of coordination could worsen problems. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon echoed fears that her constituents would be left behind. The city, under Mayor Adams, has pledged a 'corridor-wide vision,' but admits nothing comprehensive can happen without state DOT. No safety analyst has assessed the impact, but the state’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymembers Robert Carroll and Zohran Mamdani also participated, urging Albany to boost state funding and implement congestion pricing.
