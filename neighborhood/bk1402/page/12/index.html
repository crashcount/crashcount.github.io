A cyclist crushed. In Flatbush (West)-Ditmas Park-Parkville, the numbers bleed into each other. <strong>Four people killed. 555 injured.</strong> In the last twelve months, a child died. Two others were left with serious injuries. The old and the young, no one spared.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks did the most damage.</strong> Two deaths, 27 moderate injuries, three serious injuries.

Sightlines blocked, turns too fast, a moment’s inattention. The city knows this. Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections. Now, at last, the city moves. Barriers, granite blocks, planters—<strong>hard daylighting</strong>—are coming to corners where crashes pile up. &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,&rdquo; said <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city will start with high-crash spots like Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. It’s a start. Not enough.</p><p>Advocates want more. &ldquo;Anything with real (not plastic) infrastructure in street corners is good news,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>Jon Orcutt</a>. But the pace is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The numbers say otherwise. In the last year, <strong>crashes and injuries rose</strong>. The city touts new designs, but the work is piecemeal. No word from local council or state reps on speeding up the rollout or demanding more. No public fight for more barriers, more daylight, fewer deaths.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-faster>What Now: Demand More, Demand Faster</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand hard barriers at every deadly corner. Demand speed limits that save lives. Demand action before another child’s name becomes a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Traffic Mobility Review Board and MTA are debating whether to charge drivers or passengers. Carroll, joined by advocate Alex Matthiessen, proposed replacing the $2.75 FHV surcharge with a two-tiered fee on Uber/Lyft passengers, exempting drivers and yellow cabs. Carroll said, "We think that this will go to the passengers who are disproportionately wealthier than the average New Yorker and significantly wealthier than the driver." The MTA has not considered this per-trip customer fee, and it is unclear if it can be implemented. Taxi advocates support exempting drivers, but experts warn that exempting yellow cabs could shift congestion, undermining the policy’s intent. The debate continues in committee, with no final decision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics warn loopholes could push more cars onto crowded streets, risking more crashes for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate centers on congestion pricing in Manhattan, with proposals aired on June 21, 2023. The Traffic Mobility Review Board must decide if yellow cab and Uber/Lyft drivers will be tolled, or if only passengers will pay. Assembly Member Robert Carroll and advocate Alex Matthiessen back a higher passenger surcharge for Uber/Lyft rides, exempting drivers and yellow cabs. Carroll argues, 'passengers are disproportionately wealthier than the average New Yorker and significantly wealthier than the driver.' Taxi advocate Bhairavi Desai supports exempting drivers to protect jobs. Economist Charles Komanoff and analyst Bruce Schaller warn that exempting yellow cabs could shift congestion, undermining safety and policy goals. The matter’s outcome will shape who pays—and who faces the danger—on Manhattan’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani condemned the policy, saying, 'this illustrates the consequences of fiscal policy that privileges the suburbs over the larger MTA region.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll was one of the few to oppose the exemption. FPI’s Emily Eisner noted, 'there will be a 25-percent decline in the share of white workers impacted by the tax, and a 36-percent increase in the share of Black workers impacted.'

If passed, it would have forced the city to break out crash data by vehicle type, borough, and precinct—shining a light on the toll for riders and pedestrians. Instead, the city keeps counting in the dark.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law requires the Department of Transportation to 'implement daylighting at a minimum of 100 intersections a year,' meaning no parking within 15 feet of corners. High-crash intersections must be prioritized unless deemed infeasible. DOT must also install physical daylighting features, such as planters or bike corrals, where possible. Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hudson, Ossé, and others. The law took effect 90 days after enactment. DOT must report annually on locations and reasons for any exceptions. This measure targets the blind spots that kill and injure pedestrians and cyclists at intersections. The city’s streets will see more open corners and fewer hiding places for danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law was introduced on October 27, 2022, passed on May 29, 2023, and returned unsigned by the mayor. The bill amends the administrative code to require the Department of Transportation to conduct a comprehensive study of all pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries every three years, instead of every five. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian safety reporting.' Sponsors include Alexa Avilés (primary), Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Crystal Hudson, Amanda Farías, Tiffany Cabán, Lynn C. Schulman, Kalman Yeger, Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, Darlene Mealy, Eric Dinowitz, Linda Lee, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Carlina Rivera, Mercedes Narcisse, and Rita C. Joseph. The law mandates that crash reports and recommendations be sent to council members, community boards, and made public. This change increases transparency and keeps the focus on the deadly toll of cars in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
