Police said the driver, spotted near Brighton Beach, "maneuvered onto the service road in [the] direction of several officers who set up a roadblock to stop this vehicle." When the driver "veered toward one of the officers and nearly hit him," an officer fired, striking the driver. The car continued another mile before crashing again. The driver died at Brookdale Hospital. The incident was captured on police body cameras. Officers were treated at local hospitals but not injured.

The bill remains pending, with no endorsement yet from Governor Hochul. The Streetsblog article, 'Helicopter Deaths, Fast and Slow,' highlights the recent fatal crash near Jersey City that killed six and draws a stark comparison to the ongoing economic and human toll of helicopter noise. Carroll’s bill is described as the 'gold-standard' for taxing helicopter noise, with estimates that it could reduce flights by 30 to 50 percent. Carroll urges action, calling on the public to pressure Hochul to support the measure. The article underscores that the distress over crash deaths should extend to the daily suffering caused by helicopter noise, which inflicts millions in damages and degrades quality of life for city residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Epps, unlicensed, "blew a stop sign" and struck a school bus, killing his passenger, Imani Vance, and injuring the bus driver. The article quotes Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez: "The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant's reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds." Epps left the scene, tried to escape in an Uber, and was arrested after fleeing on foot. The crash was one of three fatal Brooklyn incidents that weekend. City data cited in the article shows ongoing danger: at least 15 killed in Kings County so far this year, with thousands injured, often due to driver inattention and failure to yield.

The crash highlights driver failure to yield dangers.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 49-year-old female pedestrian was injured while crossing at an intersection on Caton Ave in Brooklyn at 8:45 AM. The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when a 2016 Honda SUV, traveling east and making a left turn, struck her with its center front end. The pedestrian sustained abrasions and injuries to her elbow, lower arm, and hand but remained conscious. The vehicle sustained no damage. The report lists no contributing factors for the pedestrian but indicates the driver was making a left turn, a maneuver requiring yielding to pedestrians. This crash underscores the systemic danger posed by driver failure to yield to pedestrians legally crossing intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
