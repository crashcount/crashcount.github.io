A cyclist crushed. In Flatbush (West)-Ditmas Park-Parkville, the numbers bleed into each other. <strong>Four people killed. 555 injured.</strong> In the last twelve months, a child died. Two others were left with serious injuries. The old and the young, no one spared.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks did the most damage.</strong> Two deaths, 27 moderate injuries, three serious injuries.

Sightlines blocked, turns too fast, a moment’s inattention. The city knows this. Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections. Now, at last, the city moves. Barriers, granite blocks, planters—<strong>hard daylighting</strong>—are coming to corners where crashes pile up. &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,&rdquo; said <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city will start with high-crash spots like Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. It’s a start. Not enough.</p><p>Advocates want more. &ldquo;Anything with real (not plastic) infrastructure in street corners is good news,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>Jon Orcutt</a>. But the pace is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The numbers say otherwise. In the last year, <strong>crashes and injuries rose</strong>. The city touts new designs, but the work is piecemeal. No word from local council or state reps on speeding up the rollout or demanding more. No public fight for more barriers, more daylight, fewer deaths.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-faster>What Now: Demand More, Demand Faster</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand hard barriers at every deadly corner. Demand speed limits that save lives.

Critics warn helmet laws slash ridership and invite biased policing. The bill moves forward despite evidence of harm to vulnerable road users.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill 590, sponsored by Amy Paulin (D-Westchester), advanced in a Transportation Committee hearing on May 7, 2025. The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons. Despite evidence that helmet laws hurt vulnerable road users, the committee advanced the bill without addressing these harms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The damage mounts.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A2583, sponsored by Brooklyn Assembly Member Robert Carroll, seeks to impose hefty fees on non-essential helicopter flights over New York City. The bill remains pending, with no endorsement yet from Governor Hochul. The Streetsblog article, 'Helicopter Deaths, Fast and Slow,' highlights the recent fatal crash near Jersey City that killed six and draws a stark comparison to the ongoing economic and human toll of helicopter noise. Carroll’s bill is described as the 'gold-standard' for taxing helicopter noise, with estimates that it could reduce flights by 30 to 50 percent. Carroll urges action, calling on the public to pressure Hochul to support the measure. The article underscores that the distress over crash deaths should extend to the daily suffering caused by helicopter noise, which inflicts millions in damages and degrades quality of life for city residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One driver collected 563 speed-camera tickets in Sheepshead Bay; another, 474 in Manhattan. The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low.
