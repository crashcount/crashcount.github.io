A cyclist crushed. In Flatbush (West)-Ditmas Park-Parkville, the numbers bleed into each other. <strong>Four people killed. 555 injured.</strong> In the last twelve months, a child died. Two others were left with serious injuries. The old and the young, no one spared.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks did the most damage.</strong> Two deaths, 27 moderate injuries, three serious injuries. Cars and trucks keep rolling. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=intersections-where-lives-end>Intersections: Where Lives End</h3><p>Most deaths come at the corners. Sightlines blocked, turns too fast, a moment’s inattention. The city knows this. Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections. Now, at last, the city moves. Barriers, granite blocks, planters—<strong>hard daylighting</strong>—are coming to corners where crashes pile up. &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,&rdquo; said <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city will start with high-crash spots like Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. It’s a start. Not enough.</p><p>Advocates want more. &ldquo;Anything with real (not plastic) infrastructure in street corners is good news,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>Jon Orcutt</a>. But the pace is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The numbers say otherwise. In the last year, <strong>crashes and injuries rose</strong>. The city touts new designs, but the work is piecemeal. No word from local council or state reps on speeding up the rollout or demanding more. No public fight for more barriers, more daylight, fewer deaths.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-faster>What Now: Demand More, Demand Faster</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand hard barriers at every deadly corner. Demand speed limits that save lives. Demand action before another child’s name becomes a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation began planning a dedicated lane from Tillary Street to Avenue V. Joseph said, "Bringing a bus lane to the road will speed up bus service, while also helping to lower reliance on private cars, which will in turn help lower traffic." The B41 bus, one of Brooklyn’s busiest, crawls through traffic. Mayor Eric Adams and MTA Chair Janno Lieber also back the project, calling it a priority for bus infrastructure. The city will gather community input before moving forward. No formal bill number or committee is assigned yet. The project remains in early planning, with advocates pushing for safer, faster streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The e-scooter rider wore a helmet, but the report does not list it as a contributing factor. The driver of the sedan was licensed and traveling straight ahead.

The bill is currently a legislative proposal. Parker argues, 'we need an NYPD residency requirement, which the force had until 1962.' He highlights that over half of NYPD officers now live outside the city, undermining trust and accountability. Parker’s record includes laws on police misconduct, body cameras, and transparency. He cites a 2021 DePaul University study showing residency brings faster response times, better complaint handling, more diversity, and stronger community ties. Mayor Adams called the proposal 'a smart idea.' Parker urges Albany to act, stressing that most city civil servants already live in the five boroughs. He pledges to work on affordable housing for officers.
