A cyclist crushed. In Flatbush (West)-Ditmas Park-Parkville, the numbers bleed into each other. <strong>Four people killed. 555 injured.</strong> In the last twelve months, a child died. Two others were left with serious injuries. The old and the young, no one spared.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks did the most damage.</strong> Two deaths, 27 moderate injuries, three serious injuries.

Sightlines blocked, turns too fast, a moment’s inattention. The city knows this. Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections. Now, at last, the city moves. Barriers, granite blocks, planters—<strong>hard daylighting</strong>—are coming to corners where crashes pile up. &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,&rdquo; said <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city will start with high-crash spots like Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. It’s a start. Not enough.</p><p>Advocates want more. &ldquo;Anything with real (not plastic) infrastructure in street corners is good news,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>Jon Orcutt</a>. But the pace is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The numbers say otherwise. In the last year, <strong>crashes and injuries rose</strong>. The city touts new designs, but the work is piecemeal. No word from local council or state reps on speeding up the rollout or demanding more. No public fight for more barriers, more daylight, fewer deaths.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-faster>What Now: Demand More, Demand Faster</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand hard barriers at every deadly corner. Demand speed limits that save lives. Demand action before another child’s name becomes a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
