A cyclist crushed. In Flatbush (West)-Ditmas Park-Parkville, the numbers bleed into each other. <strong>Four people killed. 555 injured.</strong> In the last twelve months, a child died. Two others were left with serious injuries. The old and the young, no one spared.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks did the most damage.</strong> Two deaths, 27 moderate injuries, three serious injuries. Cars and trucks keep rolling. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=intersections-where-lives-end>Intersections: Where Lives End</h3><p>Most deaths come at the corners. Sightlines blocked, turns too fast, a moment’s inattention. The city knows this. Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections. Now, at last, the city moves. Barriers, granite blocks, planters—<strong>hard daylighting</strong>—are coming to corners where crashes pile up. &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,&rdquo; said <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city will start with high-crash spots like Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. It’s a start. Not enough.</p><p>Advocates want more. &ldquo;Anything with real (not plastic) infrastructure in street corners is good news,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>Jon Orcutt</a>. But the pace is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The numbers say otherwise. In the last year, <strong>crashes and injuries rose</strong>. The city touts new designs, but the work is piecemeal. No word from local council or state reps on speeding up the rollout or demanding more. No public fight for more barriers, more daylight, fewer deaths.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-faster>What Now: Demand More, Demand Faster</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand hard barriers at every deadly corner. Demand speed limits that save lives. Demand action before another child’s name becomes a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill is currently a legislative proposal. Parker argues, 'we need an NYPD residency requirement, which the force had until 1962.' He highlights that over half of NYPD officers now live outside the city, undermining trust and accountability. Parker’s record includes laws on police misconduct, body cameras, and transparency. He cites a 2021 DePaul University study showing residency brings faster response times, better complaint handling, more diversity, and stronger community ties. Mayor Adams called the proposal 'a smart idea.' Parker urges Albany to act, stressing that most city civil servants already live in the five boroughs. He pledges to work on affordable housing for officers.

Few students get lessons now. The Department of Education drags its feet. Advocates want more: protected lanes, safe routes. Drivers hold the real power. Kids need more than lessons. They need safe streets.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2022, Council Members Erik Bottcher, Rita Joseph, and Selvena Brooks-Powers introduced a resolution urging the Department of Education to teach bicycle safety in all New York City public schools. The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.' The council’s action highlights a gap between policy and real safety for children on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
