The Department of Transportation supports some measures but opposes universal daylighting. The report highlights that most pedestrians killed at intersections were at crossings without physical daylighting, and most cyclists killed were on streets without protected bike lanes.

The matter, titled 'Congestion Pricing: City Needs to Get Real With Plate, Placard Frauds,' highlights the city's weak response to license plate and placard fraud since the $9 toll launched. Council Member Vickie Paladino joked about sabotaging toll cameras, while Mayor Adams downplayed the issue. Transportation experts like Sam Schwartz called for stronger action: 'There’s a lot more the city can do.' The NYPD and Sanitation Department have removed some ghost plates, but enforcement remains patchy. Placard abuse and fake plates let drivers dodge tolls and traffic laws, eroding the policy’s impact. The anonymous watchdog Placard Corruption noted, 'Even a strong effort would probably take some time to reverse years of corruption.' Without real enforcement, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—remain at risk from unchecked, rule-breaking drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage.

She wrote on X, "a high-powered green laser pointer like the ones you find on eBay for under $30 can destroy a camera sensor." She added, "So if you buy one of these lasers, be sure to NOT point them at any cameras, because they could be permanently damaged!" Paladino also shared footage of vigilantes destroying enforcement cameras in London, warning, "it would be foolish to believe the same won't happen here in due time." Her comments came the day the MTA launched congestion pricing, which charges drivers to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. Paladino’s stance undermines the city’s efforts to control traffic and protect vulnerable road users.

Progress, setbacks, and hard truths.</p><p class=mb3>The 2024 Streetsie Awards, published December 24, 2024, by Streetsblog NYC, reviewed the year’s transportation policy. The article highlighted both progress and setbacks, stating: 'The 2024 Streetsie Awards by Streetsblog NYC review the year's best and worst in NYC transportation policy, highlighting key events, policies, and political actors.' Key actions included the City Council decriminalizing jaywalking and cutting mandatory parking minimums, though low-density areas were left out. Council Member Lincoln Restler lost his Transportation Committee seat despite pushing for citizen enforcement against illegal parking. Speaker Adrienne Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Mayor Adams were all named for missed promises or weak follow-through. Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch’s crackdown on ghost plates drew praise. The review called out Gov. Hochul for delaying congestion pricing, then reversing course. The NYPD faced criticism for ignoring placard abuse and Vision Zero, and for deadly high-speed chases. The piece underscored the need for accountability and stronger action to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children.
