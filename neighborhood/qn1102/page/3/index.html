Half were walking or biking. This is the highest toll since Vision Zero began. Families and advocates demand urgent action. City officials debate speed limits, daylighting, and protected lanes. The danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>A new report released January 28, 2025, by Transportation Alternatives shows a record number of children killed in car crashes during Mayor Adams's first three years. The report states, 'the number of children and teens killed in car crashes in NYC has reached record highs, with 16 kids killed last year.' Councilmember Vickie Paladino opposes Vision Zero, speed cameras, and bike lanes. Councilmember Chris Marte leads efforts to reopen Park Row to cars, a move criticized by safety advocates. The Department of Transportation supports some safety measures, like speed governors and suspending registrations for repeat offenders, but rejects universal daylighting, claiming other treatments work better. Advocates and family members call for lower speed limits, more protected bike lanes, and urgent reforms to save lives. The DOT disputes some findings, especially on daylighting and fatality trends. The debate over safety measures continues as children pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact caused the garage to collapse onto both his SUV and a parked, unoccupied Prius. Police said Barry was trapped and later died at Jamaica Hospital.

The matter, titled "Masters of Deflection: Congestion Pricing Foes Stoke Fear of Subway Crime," highlights how some council members and political groups use concerns about subway crime to oppose congestion pricing. Councilwoman Vickie Paladino voiced strong opposition, while advocates like Sara Lind and Ben Furnas countered that such arguments ignore real solutions and endanger transit funding. The article notes, 'Data shows the subway is statistically safer than city streets for both pedestrians and drivers.' Despite visible homelessness and high-profile crimes, most riders continue to use the subway. The debate exposes how fear is weaponized to block policies that could reduce traffic violence and improve safety for vulnerable road users.

The matter, titled 'Congestion Pricing: City Needs to Get Real With Plate, Placard Frauds,' highlights the city's weak response to license plate and placard fraud since the $9 toll launched. Council Member Vickie Paladino joked about sabotaging toll cameras, while Mayor Adams downplayed the issue. Transportation experts like Sam Schwartz called for stronger action: 'There’s a lot more the city can do.' The NYPD and Sanitation Department have removed some ghost plates, but enforcement remains patchy. Placard abuse and fake plates let drivers dodge tolls and traffic laws, eroding the policy’s impact. The anonymous watchdog Placard Corruption noted, 'Even a strong effort would probably take some time to reverse years of corruption.' Without real enforcement, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—remain at risk from unchecked, rule-breaking drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She added, "So if you buy one of these lasers, be sure to NOT point them at any cameras, because they could be permanently damaged!" Paladino also shared footage of vigilantes destroying enforcement cameras in London, warning, "it would be foolish to believe the same won't happen here in due time." Her comments came the day the MTA launched congestion pricing, which charges drivers to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. Paladino’s stance undermines the city’s efforts to control traffic and protect vulnerable road users.

The fight is far from over.</p><p class=mb3>On December 11, 2024, the City Council held a hearing on a bill to require city-level licensing and registration for e-bikes and e-scooters not covered by state law. The bill, sponsored by Councilmember Bob Holden, claims to address 'the proliferation of these vehicles' and their impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety. Councilmember Vickie Paladino, District 19, insisted, 'This is a safety issue.' Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez countered, 'We agree with the intent, but we believe that mandating registration and licensing is not a solution.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams warned the bill would 'have a disparate impact on low-income individuals, people of color, and undocumented migrants.' A separate resolution from Councilmember Gale Brewer supports licensing only for commercial e-bikes. The hearing exposed deep rifts over enforcement, equity, and the real sources of street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On December 10, 2024, Manhattan Community Board 2’s transportation and parks committees reviewed Council Member Vickie Paladino’s proposal to ban e-bikes from city parks. The committees voted overwhelmingly against it. The matter, described as an effort to 'make it more harmonious and safer for people in parks,' was criticized as 'not fleshed out.' Paladino, a Queens Republican, failed to provide data or address existing rules. Co-sponsor Gale Brewer admitted she signed on under pressure and doubted enforcement. Committee members Shirley Secunda, Susanna Aaron, Janet Liff, and Jeannine Kiely all voiced strong opposition, calling the bill redundant and inadequate. The Central Park Conservancy declined to endorse a ban, urging more protected bike lanes instead.

Critics, including Michael Sisitzky of NYCLU and Luis Cortes of Los Deliveristas Unidos, warn the bill will lead to discriminatory policing and criminalize delivery workers.

Opponents argue the toll will worsen economic pain in areas with high storefront vacancy. Despite the uproar, the policy’s impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety remains unaddressed in this debate.
