No answers.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They say speed cameras work. They say they are redesigning streets. But here, the numbers do not move fast enough. Last year, one person died. This year, none—so far. But injuries are up 40% over last year. Crashes keep coming.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to act.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council can do it now. The Mayor can push. The DOT can build more protected space. But every day they wait, the street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets where children can walk and come home.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill sits with the Senate, awaiting committee action. Its matter title reads: 'Establishes a bicycle and electric scooter operator's safety manual; provides for the issuance of a license...; requires liability insurance for electric scooters in cities having a population of one million or more.' Primary sponsor Luis R. Sepúlveda (District 32) and co-sponsor Joseph P. Addabbo Jr. (District 15) back the measure. S 5801 would require e-scooter riders in New York City to pass a safety manual, obtain a license, and buy insurance. It also bans sales to unlicensed, uninsured buyers. The bill's impact on vulnerable road users is not assessed. Lawmakers claim it will curb reckless riding, but the real effect on street safety remains unmeasured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sedan driver, a 77-year-old male, was injured with back trauma and whiplash but was conscious and restrained by a lap belt and harness. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'View Obstructed/Limited' as contributing factors.

It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.
