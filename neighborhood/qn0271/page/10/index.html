In the last twelve months, 41 people were hurt in 46 crashes in Calvary & Mount Zion Cemeteries. No one suffered a serious injury, but pain lingers. Over three years, 148 people have been injured in 209 crashes. <strong>No deaths. One serious injury.</strong> The rest—bruises, whiplash, bleeding, broken days and broken bodies. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Most victims are working-age adults.</strong> The young and old are not immune. In the past year, people aged 25 to 54 made up the bulk of the injured. A 33-year-old e-bike rider, bleeding and conscious, after a truck stopped in traffic. A 26-year-old pedestrian, hit by an SUV while working in the road. A 61-year-old passenger, neck snapped by a crash at unsafe speed. The machines that hurt them: trucks, SUVs, sedans, buses. The causes: speed, distraction, following too close. The pattern: relentless.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. They say speed cameras cut speeding by 63%. But the cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The law is always about to expire. The limit is always about to drop. The work is always almost done. <strong>No one here has died, but every injury is a warning.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy, by design, by delay. The city can lower the speed limit now. Albany can keep the cameras on. Local leaders can act, or they can wait for the first death. <strong>Don’t let them wait.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and real protection for people who walk, bike, and work here.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Cyclists no longer risk slipping or punctured tires on metal grates. Council Member Julie Won joined DOT and others to push the project. Riders get a safer, smoother crossing.</p><p class=mb3>On December 13, 2022, Council Member Julie Won (District 26) joined city officials to mark the completion of a DOT pilot project covering the Roosevelt Island Bridge bike lane. The project, coordinated with Council Member Julie Menin, used fiber-reinforced polymer panels to shield riders from the bridge’s hazardous metal grating. The official matter: 'Roosevelt Island Bridge bike lane now covered for a safer, smoother ride.' Won praised the project’s quick finish and its promise of safer, more comfortable biking. DOT and community leaders noted the new surface prevents slips and flats, separating cyclists from traffic. The $100,000 upgrade, never before used in New York, aims to keep vulnerable road users out of harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, promised by former Mayor Bill de Blasio, would have made the southern roadway pedestrian-only and the northern path bike-only by the end of 2022. Instead, DOT postponed this until at least late 2023, citing the need to keep seven of nine car lanes open during bridge rehabilitation.

Council Member Julie Won criticized the move, saying, 'The city must open the south outer roadway immediately for our safety. DOT should stop prioritizing cars over the safety of pedestrians.' Advocates point to rising bike ridership and crashes on the narrow shared path.

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible.

Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians.

An e-bike, traveling straight, struck the back of the truck. According to the police report, 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' contributed to the crash. The e-bike rider, a 33-year-old man, was partially ejected and suffered a severe eye injury with heavy bleeding. He was wearing a helmet and remained conscious. No injuries were reported for the truck's occupants. The data lists driver inattention as a key factor, with no mention of errors by the e-bike rider beyond the helmet, which is only noted after driver actions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
