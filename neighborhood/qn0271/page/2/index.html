In the last twelve months, 41 people were hurt in 46 crashes in Calvary & Mount Zion Cemeteries. No one suffered a serious injury, but pain lingers. Over three years, 148 people have been injured in 209 crashes. <strong>No deaths. One serious injury.</strong> The rest—bruises, whiplash, bleeding, broken days and broken bodies. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Most victims are working-age adults.</strong> The young and old are not immune. In the past year, people aged 25 to 54 made up the bulk of the injured. A 33-year-old e-bike rider, bleeding and conscious, after a truck stopped in traffic. A 26-year-old pedestrian, hit by an SUV while working in the road. A 61-year-old passenger, neck snapped by a crash at unsafe speed. The machines that hurt them: trucks, SUVs, sedans, buses. The causes: speed, distraction, following too close. The pattern: relentless.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. They say speed cameras cut speeding by 63%. But the cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The law is always about to expire. The limit is always about to drop. The work is always almost done. <strong>No one here has died, but every injury is a warning.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy, by design, by delay. The city can lower the speed limit now. Albany can keep the cameras on. Local leaders can act, or they can wait for the first death. <strong>Don’t let them wait.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Prosecutors allege Peña was drunk, high, and speeding at 83 mph—three times the limit—when he ran a red light and T-boned 23-year-old Justin Diaz’s car. Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield.

The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips.

Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.

The resolution, handled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced February 28, 2024. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to conduct a comprehensive Environmental Impact Study on the viability of the proposed QueensLink project.' Council Member Robert F. Holden led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Ariola, Banks, Joseph, Gennaro, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. All committee members voted 'affirmative.' The QueensLink would restore 3.5 miles of dormant rail, linking northern and southern Queens, and could serve tens of thousands daily. The Council demands a full study before any track is laid, seeking facts on impact, cost, and safety for all who move through Queens.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, discussed in the council and supported by the NYC Department of Transportation, aims to ticket drivers who double park or block critical spaces. The bill summary states: 'Double parking and curb violations aren’t just a nuisance – they’re a public safety hazard.' Raga and DOT officials argue that manual enforcement cannot keep up with rising car numbers, leaving pedestrians and cyclists at risk. Raga led the push, highlighting blocked hydrants and crosswalks as threats. DOT said automated enforcement 'helps keep streets clear, reduces congestion, and protects New Yorkers.' Delivery drivers voiced concern about work impacts, but the bill’s focus remains on clearing space for vulnerable road users. The proposal awaits further council action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, not yet assigned a committee or number, seeks to automate enforcement where manual efforts fall short. Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead. The Department of Transportation supports the expansion, stating, 'Automated enforcement has proven to change driver behavior and make our streets safer for everyone.'
