In the last twelve months, 41 people were hurt in 46 crashes in Calvary & Mount Zion Cemeteries. No one suffered a serious injury, but pain lingers. Over three years, 148 people have been injured in 209 crashes. <strong>No deaths. One serious injury.</strong> The rest—bruises, whiplash, bleeding, broken days and broken bodies. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Most victims are working-age adults.</strong> The young and old are not immune. In the past year, people aged 25 to 54 made up the bulk of the injured. A 33-year-old e-bike rider, bleeding and conscious, after a truck stopped in traffic. A 26-year-old pedestrian, hit by an SUV while working in the road. A 61-year-old passenger, neck snapped by a crash at unsafe speed. The machines that hurt them: trucks, SUVs, sedans, buses. The causes: speed, distraction, following too close. The pattern: relentless.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. They say speed cameras cut speeding by 63%. But the cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The law is always about to expire. The limit is always about to drop. The work is always almost done. <strong>No one here has died, but every injury is a warning.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy, by design, by delay. The city can lower the speed limit now. Albany can keep the cameras on. Local leaders can act, or they can wait for the first death. <strong>Don’t let them wait.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and real protection for people who walk, bike, and work here.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Introduced February 28, 2024, it urges the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), A.1901 (Crash Victims Bill of Rights), and the full SAFE Streets Act package. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ in relation to allowing New York city to establish a lower speed limit, and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.'

Hanif leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gutiérrez, Restler, Ossé, Avilés, Sanchez, Krishnan, Rivera, Cabán, Brewer, Abreu, Marte, Brannan, Schulman, Won, Feliz, Bottcher, Nurse, Hudson, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The SAFE Streets Act targets reckless driving, demands safer street design, and gives crash victims more rights.

Critics argue the move is too late, as congestion pricing was approved in 2019. Some unions warn of possible driver shortages, but Mamdani insists existing buses and operators can handle the expansion.

The bill orders daylighting at intersections and new signage. It aims to cut crashes, boost visibility, and shrink truck miles. Sponsors demand safer streets for people on foot and bike. Change is now law.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0708-2022, now Local Law 171 of 2023, was enacted by the City Council on December 16, 2023, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The closure, prompted by Council Member Julie Won’s concerns about cars and mopeds endangering park users, left cyclists stranded. Parks gave no explanation, then removed chained fencing and installed three bollards to block cars. Won met with Parks and pushed for a solution, but declined to say if she supports a continuous protected bike lane on Vernon Boulevard. The matter summary: 'The Parks Department reopened the greenway path through Queensbridge Park less than 48 hours after Streetsblog reported the abrupt, unexplained closure of a crucial cycling route.' Cyclists and advocates welcomed the reopening but criticized the lack of notice and the ongoing gap in protected bike infrastructure. Won is also working with DOT and NYCHA to install more barriers in nearby parks. The greenway remains the only protected route for cyclists in the area.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers.

The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal. No formal bill number or committee was cited; the event focused on immediate community engagement and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
