In the last twelve months, 41 people were hurt in 46 crashes in Calvary & Mount Zion Cemeteries. No one suffered a serious injury, but pain lingers. Over three years, 148 people have been injured in 209 crashes. <strong>No deaths. One serious injury.</strong> The rest—bruises, whiplash, bleeding, broken days and broken bodies. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Most victims are working-age adults.</strong> The young and old are not immune. In the past year, people aged 25 to 54 made up the bulk of the injured. A 33-year-old e-bike rider, bleeding and conscious, after a truck stopped in traffic. A 26-year-old pedestrian, hit by an SUV while working in the road. A 61-year-old passenger, neck snapped by a crash at unsafe speed. The machines that hurt them: trucks, SUVs, sedans, buses. The causes: speed, distraction, following too close. The pattern: relentless.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. They say speed cameras cut speeding by 63%. But the cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The law is always about to expire. The limit is always about to drop. The work is always almost done. <strong>No one here has died, but every injury is a warning.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy, by design, by delay. The city can lower the speed limit now. Albany can keep the cameras on. Local leaders can act, or they can wait for the first death. <strong>Don’t let them wait.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Vulnerable users finally get space.</p><p class=mb3>On July 30, 2024, the Department of Transportation (DOT) began construction to convert the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway into a pedestrian-only lane. The project, first promised in 2017 and announced by former Mayor Bill de Blasio for completion in 2022, faced years of delays. Council Member Julie Won stated, “After years of delays, broken promises, and missed deadlines, construction...has finally begun.” The DOT’s plan aims to separate nearly 3,000 daily pedestrians and 7,000 cyclists, who have long shared a cramped, dangerous path. Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives said, “The city has been on notice for years about this problem and it is their responsibility to provide a safe facility for walking and biking.” Crashes and injuries continued as the city prioritized car traffic, keeping the lane open to drivers during bridge rehab. The new pedestrian path, with added fencing and sidewalk extensions, promises overdue safety for those on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Legislature rejected Hochul’s push for a payroll tax hike, then considered a vague $1 billion IOU for the MTA, with no funding source. Gianaris told reporters the proposal would simply promise a billion dollars for the next year’s budget, but offered no details. The bill has not been introduced or assigned to committee. Betsy Plum of the Riders Alliance warned, 'The proposal on the table will not fix the subway. A billion dollar IOU is not nearly enough money nor is it nearly secure enough to build trust and rebuild our critical infrastructure.' With no new revenue, the MTA’s ability to fund repairs and upgrades remains in doubt. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders—face continued danger as safe, reliable alternatives to driving are left unfunded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'

Vulnerable users endure.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0662-2024, now in the Committee on Public Safety, was introduced on March 19, 2024. The bill aims to 'increase certain penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles,' targeting violations like loud engines, illegal claxons, and air horns. Council Member Sandra Ung leads as primary sponsor, joined by Bottcher, Lee, Brannan, Brewer, Vernikov, Zhuang, Gennaro, Won, Louis, Restler, and the Manhattan Borough President. The bill would raise fines for both light and heavy vehicles. It was referred to committee on the day of introduction. No vote has been held. The measure addresses noise but does not directly tackle the physical dangers cars pose to pedestrians and cyclists. Vulnerable road users still face the same risks from traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan boosts service and expands free routes. Riders win more access. The bill also funds rail links and fare breaks for low-income, seniors, and disabled. Enforcement on tolls gets softer. Streets shift for people.</p><p class=mb3>On March 12, 2024, state lawmakers released a budget proposal targeting New York City transit. The bill, led by Andrea Stewart-Cousins and mentioned in the Assembly and Senate one-house budgets, calls for $90 million to increase bus frequency and expand the MTA's free bus pilot. The matter summary states: 'State lawmakers proposed spending $90 million this year to improve bus service frequency and expand the scope of the MTA's free bus pilot.' The proposal, supported by Sen. Michael Gianaris and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, also adopts the FARES Act, extending half-price MetroCards to commuter rail, and funds new discounts for seniors and people with disabilities. Lawmakers back the QueensLink rail project and recommend subway improvements. They reject tougher toll enforcement, instead supporting the Toll Payer Protection Act. The plan aims to make transit faster, cheaper, and more accessible for millions of riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
