In the last twelve months, 41 people were hurt in 46 crashes in Calvary & Mount Zion Cemeteries. No one suffered a serious injury, but pain lingers. Over three years, 148 people have been injured in 209 crashes. <strong>No deaths. One serious injury.</strong> The rest—bruises, whiplash, bleeding, broken days and broken bodies. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Most victims are working-age adults.</strong> The young and old are not immune. In the past year, people aged 25 to 54 made up the bulk of the injured. A 33-year-old e-bike rider, bleeding and conscious, after a truck stopped in traffic. A 26-year-old pedestrian, hit by an SUV while working in the road. A 61-year-old passenger, neck snapped by a crash at unsafe speed. The machines that hurt them: trucks, SUVs, sedans, buses. The causes: speed, distraction, following too close. The pattern: relentless.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. They say speed cameras cut speeding by 63%. But the cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The law is always about to expire. The limit is always about to drop. The work is always almost done. <strong>No one here has died, but every injury is a warning.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy, by design, by delay. The city can lower the speed limit now. Albany can keep the cameras on. Local leaders can act, or they can wait for the first death. <strong>Don’t let them wait.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and real protection for people who walk, bike, and work here.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The need remains.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0965-2023 was introduced on March 16, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill required the Department of Transportation to install at least 100 miles of protected bicycle lanes annually until 2029. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of protected bicycle lanes.' Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Sandy Nurse, Erik D. Bottcher, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Shekar Krishnan, Julie Won, Chi A. Ossé, Tiffany Cabán, Christopher Marte, Crystal Hudson, and Rita C. Joseph. The bill was filed at the end of session, never enacted. The city’s protected bike lane network remains incomplete. Cyclists and other vulnerable road users still face daily risk from cars and trucks.

The incident sparked a petition—over 26,000 signatures—calling for traffic lights to replace stop signs at three crossings. Gianaris pledged to 'make sure we fix Newtown Road where this happened, and to honor her father's request that there be traffic lights there.' The Department of Transportation upgraded crosswalk markings but has not committed to a traffic light, citing a low crash history. Residents and the victim’s family say the intersection remains dangerous, with drivers ignoring stop signs. Gianaris’s support highlights official recognition of the need for stronger protections for pedestrians, especially children, at this site.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lawmakers wrote, “Nothing can bring back Dolma Naadhun, but we can prevent further loss of life so that no family must experience the loss of a loved one.” DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed a Council bill mandating 100 daylighted intersections per year, arguing for flexibility and physical infrastructure in daylit spaces.

The hearing, part of the state budget process, saw Lieber defend Governor Hochul’s proposed 5.5-percent fare increase as a return to regular hikes paused during the pandemic. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and colleagues pushed the 'Fix the MTA' package to freeze fares, boost service, and make buses free. Mamdani argued, 'It is simply not acceptable to put the cost of a basic public good on the backs of working class New Yorkers.' Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris criticized Lieber for insisting on fare hikes while dismissing other budget solutions. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas opposed making her constituents pay more. Lieber expressed concern about free buses, preferring targeted affordability programs. The hearing highlighted a sharp divide: lawmakers want to protect riders; the MTA wants stable funding.

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous. Lawmakers are under pressure to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation failed to build the 30 miles of protected bike lanes and 20 miles of bus lanes required by law. The agency scaled back busway hours on Jamaica Avenue and 181st Street after local pushback. Council Member Oswald Feliz opposed Fordham Road improvements, calling them an 'existential threat.' Queens Council Member Julie Won labeled Queensboro Bridge delays 'garbage.' The DOT removed protected bike lanes during Fourth Avenue construction, endangering cyclists. The Central Park Conservancy stalled on safety studies. Canal Street and Ocean Parkway saw little progress. The report states: 'city agencies failing to prioritize or deliver on street safety and sustainable transportation commitments.' Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—remain at risk as the city delays, dithers, and disappoints.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It claims the plan would add $638 million a year to the MTA’s deficits and criticizes the idea as reckless. Gianaris, along with Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, is called out for joining the push. The editorial’s focus is fiscal: 'making all city buses free by 2026... would add an estimated $638 million a year to the MTA’s multi-billion dollar deficits.' There is no assessment of how this policy would affect vulnerable road users.

Funding would rise from $200 million in 2023 to $638 million in 2026, with $488 million yearly for more buses and $300 million annually for frequent subways. Mamdani called the proposal 'urgent and necessary,' stressing that 'seniors, working class New Yorkers, people who use the bus the most are able to do so without fear of being priced out.'
