The bill, handled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on May 19, 2022, and passed on January 6, 2024. The official title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to notice requirements for certain transportation projects and the repeal of section 19-187 in relation thereto.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of colleagues. The law repeals the old, separate bike lane notice process and folds it into the broader project notice rules. Now, after a set notice period and community feedback, the Department of Transportation can move ahead without delay. This change aims to cut red tape and speed up street redesigns that affect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024.

The bill’s title: 'A Local Law in relation to parking for tractor trailers and other commercial trucks.' It requires the city to identify at least one feasible off-street parking location for tractor trailers in each borough by the end of 2023, and to establish those sites by December 31, 2025. No location can be on a residential street. Council Member Kamillah Hanks sponsored the bill, joined by Brannan, Riley, Dinowitz, Ung, Brooks-Powers, and others. The law aims to clear residential streets of oversized trucks, shifting their presence to designated lots. The council’s action targets the chronic hazard of trucks parked where people walk, bike, and live.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
