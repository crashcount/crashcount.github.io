Six seriously hurt.</strong> In just over three years, the streets of Sheepshead Bay–Manhattan Beach–Gerritsen Beach have claimed lives and broken bodies. The dead include the old and the very old—a 99-year-old man crossing at an intersection, a 57-year-old woman riding in a car, a 77-year-old driver crushed on Ocean Avenue, and a 58-year-old man struck while crossing Belt Parkway. Their names are not here. Their absence is.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months:</strong> 334 people injured, two left with life-changing wounds.

The measure, heard in committee and passed 46-1-1, bans non-essential helicopters that fail FAA noise standards from East 34th Street and Wall Street heliports starting in late 2029. The matter summary states: 'ban noisy non-essential helicopter flights from city heliports following a recent fatal crash.' Majority Leader Amanda Farias, the sponsor, said, 'Intro 26 is a bold step toward a healthier, quieter, and more equitable city.' Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, District 48, voted against the bill. The legislation now awaits Mayor Eric Adams’ signature. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the bill responds to helicopter crashes that threaten New Yorkers on the ground.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets remain dangerous. Action still pending.</p><p class=mb3>On April 21, 2025, the City Council’s transportation committee held a hearing on parking policy. Three bills were considered: a daylighting bill by Councilmember Julie Won to ban parking near crosswalks and require 1,000 daylighting barriers per year; a bill by Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse to waive extra fees for late parking ticket responses; and a bill by Councilmember Natasha Williams to create overnight truck parking in industrial zones. The matter summary reads: 'NYC Council to examine truck parking, daylighting and fine relief in hearing on city parking woes.' Narcisse’s bill targets fee relief for drivers who respond to violations between 45 and 90 days. Won’s daylighting bill drew support from 120 organizations. DOT faced questions on loading zones, permit abuse, and intersection safety. The hearing spotlighted the city’s struggle to balance safety for pedestrians and cyclists with business and driver concerns. No final votes yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
