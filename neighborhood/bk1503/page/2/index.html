The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031.

He refused a Breathalyzer test at the scene. He was charged with driving while intoxicated, driving while impaired, and refusing the test. The Department of Education referred questions to the NYPD.

The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year.

The project would reconnect Queens by rail. The vote passed. Lawmakers want answers on impact. Riders in transit deserts wait. The city pushes for data before tracks return.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0059-2024, adopted by the City Council on April 10, 2025, urges the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to conduct a comprehensive Environmental Impact Study on the proposed QueensLink project. The resolution, handled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced February 28, 2024. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to conduct a comprehensive Environmental Impact Study on the viability of the proposed QueensLink project.' Council Member Robert F. Holden led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Ariola, Banks, Joseph, Gennaro, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. All committee members voted 'affirmative.' The QueensLink would restore 3.5 miles of dormant rail, linking northern and southern Queens, and could serve tens of thousands daily. The Council demands a full study before any track is laid, seeking facts on impact, cost, and safety for all who move through Queens.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets grow more dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Bill concerns rezoning at 2501 Coney Island Ave. On April 10, 2025, Council Member Inna Vernikov (R-Sheepshead Bay) secured changes: the project shrank from 11 to 4 stories, 60 to 27 units, and affordable homes halved from 16 to 8. Parking jumped from 24 to 35 spaces. Vernikov cited 'neighborhood character and parking' as reasons. Her Land Use director said, 'We have to fight to protect every parking spot.' The local community board and Vernikov demanded a one-to-one parking ratio. Rachel Fee, an advocate, called it 'inexcusable' to have more parking than homes in a transit-rich city. The move prioritizes cars over people, deepening the housing crisis and increasing danger for vulnerable road users. No safety improvements were made for pedestrians or cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The child, who was walking without a signal, sustained facial abrasions but remained conscious at the scene. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the sole contributing factor to the crash. The SUV’s right front bumper made contact with the pedestrian. No mention of helmet use or signaling appears in the police data.
