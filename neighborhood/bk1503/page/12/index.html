Pedestrians take two of the deaths; car occupants take two more, according to city data for Sheepshead Bay–Manhattan Beach–Gerritsen Beach. The worst toll sits on the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Belt Parkway</a>. Two killed. 257 injured.</li><li>A 58-year-old man died walking near the Belt in 2022. A taxi and a sedan hit him. Police logged him as a pedestrian not at an intersection <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4578958)</a>.</li><li>A 57-year-old passenger died in a Belt Parkway pileup in 2023. Seven vehicles. One unlicensed driver among them <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4680397)</a>.</li><li>In 2024, a 77-year-old driver on Ocean Avenue was killed in a three-car crash. He was unconscious at the scene <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4720212)</a>.</li><li>Since then, the injuries keep coming. Pedestrians: 212. Cyclists: 71. Other motorized riders: 43. The data runs through August 24, 2025 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(NYC Open Data rollup)</a>.</li></ul><p>Speed peaks. People break.</p><ul><li>The clock tells a story. Injuries spike in the afternoon. The 4 p.m. hour carries 84 injuries and two deaths. The 5 p.m. hour has 102 injuries. Night doesn’t save you: 9 p.m. shows another death <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(hourly distribution)</a>.</li><li>SUVs lead pedestrian harm here: 93 pedestrian casualties, including one death, tied to SUVs.

A taxi accounts for another pedestrian death <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(causes of pedestrian injuries)</a>.</li><li>“Criminal charges for him were still pending,” police said in one Brooklyn crash covered citywide this month. Another line from the same day: a bus hit a teen on a scooter; the boy was critical <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>(Gothamist roundup)</a>. The pattern is bigger than one block.</li></ul><p>Three corners.

So is <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Ocean Avenue</a>.

Daylighting at corners. Hardened turns. Leading pedestrian intervals. Targeted enforcement at the repeat hotspots. The afternoon hours need it most.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>Albany gave the city power to lower speeds. Advocates say use it. “Sammy’s Law gave NYC the power to set safer speeds. Lower our residential speed limit to 20 mph,” our site tells readers to demand <a href=/take_action/>(Take Action)</a>.</li><li>The state is weighing speed limiters for repeat speeders. The bill — <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> — would require intelligent speed assistance after a record of violations. Senators moved it through committee in June <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>(Open States file)</a>. City press has shown what repeat offenders do to families. One Streetsblog analysis ties a small group of drivers to a big share of deaths <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/16/map-quest-meet-the-citys-most-dangerous-drivers-and-where-theyre-preying-on-you>(Streetsblog overview)</a>.</li><li>On the ground, some electeds fought basic visibility. A DOT report against universal daylighting became fuel for opponents, including Council Member Inna Vernikov <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/we-told-you-so-dots-anti-daylighting-scare-tactic-now-fuels-pro-car-pols>(coverage)</a>.

The corners don’t.</p><ul><li>This year to date, crashes are up about 27% over last year at this time. Injuries are up, too <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(period stats)</a>.</li><li>Peak hours. Same streets. Same toll.</li></ul><p>What now</p><ul><li>Lower the default city speed to 20 mph. Deploy speed limiters for repeat speeders. Fix the corners that do the most harm. The law and the data allow it. The delay costs lives.

Narcisse calls this 'a troubling picture of racial disparities.' She states, 'Jaywalking should not be a criminal matter that disproportionately impacts certain groups based on race or ethnicity.'

Politicians split. Riders left stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the MTA Board heard public testimony and political debate on the fallout from Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing, which was set to begin June 30. The meeting focused on the loss of funding for transit accessibility. The matter, described as 'New Yorkers decry loss of congestion pricing money for accessible transit to MTA Board,' drew sharp criticism from disability advocates and riders. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, representing District 23, praised the Governor’s pause, calling congestion pricing 'the wrong plan for my constituents.' The pause leaves a $15 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, halting upgrades like elevators and ramps at dozens of stations. Advocates warned that without this funding, disabled New Yorkers, seniors, and veterans remain shut out of the subway. The MTA faces a federal mandate to make 95% of stations accessible by 2055, but these projects now stall. Riders demanded action. Politicians offered little hope.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
