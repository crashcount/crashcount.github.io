Six seriously hurt.</strong> In just over three years, the streets of Sheepshead Bay–Manhattan Beach–Gerritsen Beach have claimed lives and broken bodies. The dead include the old and the very old—a 99-year-old man crossing at an intersection, a 57-year-old woman riding in a car, a 77-year-old driver crushed on Ocean Avenue, and a 58-year-old man struck while crossing Belt Parkway. Their names are not here. Their absence is.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months:</strong> 334 people injured, two left with life-changing wounds.
