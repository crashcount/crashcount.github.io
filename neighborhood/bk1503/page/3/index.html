Same ending.</p><ul><li>Four people are dead here since 2022. Hundreds are hurt. Pedestrians take two of the deaths; car occupants take two more, according to city data for Sheepshead Bay–Manhattan Beach–Gerritsen Beach. The worst toll sits on the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Belt Parkway</a>. Two killed. 257 injured.</li><li>A 58-year-old man died walking near the Belt in 2022. A taxi and a sedan hit him. Police logged him as a pedestrian not at an intersection <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4578958)</a>.</li><li>A 57-year-old passenger died in a Belt Parkway pileup in 2023. Seven vehicles. One unlicensed driver among them <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4680397)</a>.</li><li>In 2024, a 77-year-old driver on Ocean Avenue was killed in a three-car crash. He was unconscious at the scene <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4720212)</a>.</li><li>Since then, the injuries keep coming. Pedestrians: 212. Cyclists: 71. Other motorized riders: 43. The data runs through August 24, 2025 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(NYC Open Data rollup)</a>.</li></ul><p>Speed peaks. People break.</p><ul><li>The clock tells a story. Injuries spike in the afternoon. The 4 p.m. hour carries 84 injuries and two deaths. The 5 p.m. hour has 102 injuries. Night doesn’t save you: 9 p.m. shows another death <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(hourly distribution)</a>.</li><li>SUVs lead pedestrian harm here: 93 pedestrian casualties, including one death, tied to SUVs.

A taxi accounts for another pedestrian death <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(causes of pedestrian injuries)</a>.</li><li>“Criminal charges for him were still pending,” police said in one Brooklyn crash covered citywide this month.

Daylighting at corners. Hardened turns. Leading pedestrian intervals. Targeted enforcement at the repeat hotspots. The afternoon hours need it most.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>Albany gave the city power to lower speeds. Advocates say use it. “Sammy’s Law gave NYC the power to set safer speeds. Lower our residential speed limit to 20 mph,” our site tells readers to demand <a href=/take_action/>(Take Action)</a>.</li><li>The state is weighing speed limiters for repeat speeders. The bill — <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> — would require intelligent speed assistance after a record of violations. Senators moved it through committee in June <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>(Open States file)</a>. City press has shown what repeat offenders do to families. One Streetsblog analysis ties a small group of drivers to a big share of deaths <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/16/map-quest-meet-the-citys-most-dangerous-drivers-and-where-theyre-preying-on-you>(Streetsblog overview)</a>.</li><li>On the ground, some electeds fought basic visibility. A DOT report against universal daylighting became fuel for opponents, including Council Member Inna Vernikov <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/we-told-you-so-dots-anti-daylighting-scare-tactic-now-fuels-pro-car-pols>(coverage)</a>. Earlier, she pushed DOT to pause bike lanes in Southern Brooklyn <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>(report)</a>.</li></ul><p>The names fade. The corners don’t.</p><ul><li>This year to date, crashes are up about 27% over last year at this time. Injuries are up, too <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(period stats)</a>.</li><li>Peak hours. Same streets. Same toll.</li></ul><p>What now</p><ul><li>Lower the default city speed to 20 mph. Deploy speed limiters for repeat speeders. Fix the corners that do the most harm. The law and the data allow it. The delay costs lives. Act. <a href=/take_action/>Take action</a>.</li></ul></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets clear. Delays drop. Fewer cars mean more space for people. The city breathes. Vulnerable road users gain ground. Data shows real relief, not empty promises.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the Regional Plan Association released a report on congestion pricing’s impact. The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use. Safety analysts note congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and supports safer, more equitable streets. The program’s future now rests with the federal courts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety slips further from reach.</p><p class=mb3>On June 17, 2025, Mayor Eric Adams and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch announced the expansion of their 'quality-of-life' pilot program at a press conference. The program, which turns routine traffic violations by cyclists into criminal summonses, will go citywide by the end of August. The matter, reported by Streetsblog NYC as 'The Crackdown This Time Edition,' drew sharp criticism from advocates and riders. Council Member Mercedes Narcisse acknowledged drivers as the main threat to pedestrians but called for consideration of drivers in transit deserts. Mayor Adams promised to consult with communities before redesigning streets. Safety analysts warn: expanding this enforcement targets vulnerable road users, discourages cycling, and shifts blame from drivers and infrastructure. The move undermines mode shift and street safety, putting cyclists and pedestrians at greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He crashed into a Volvo at Avenue U, triggering a chain-reaction that sent the Volvo into a marked NYPD car. The article states, "One police officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, as well as head trauma, while another suffered a broken hip." A passenger in the Suburban was ejected and critically injured. The driver, Diyorjon Sobirjonov, was charged with DWI, reckless endangerment, and related offenses after refusing a blood-alcohol test.

The mayor cited 'community concerns' and stated, 'After several incidents—including some involving children...we decided to adjust the current design.' City Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the move, calling it 'pure politics' and warning, 'He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists.' The article highlights tension between local complaints and street safety policy. No driver error is cited; the crash involved a cyclist and a child.

Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp.
