Six seriously hurt.</strong> In just over three years, the streets of Sheepshead Bay–Manhattan Beach–Gerritsen Beach have claimed lives and broken bodies. The dead include the old and the very old—a 99-year-old man crossing at an intersection, a 57-year-old woman riding in a car, a 77-year-old driver crushed on Ocean Avenue, and a 58-year-old man struck while crossing Belt Parkway. Their names are not here. Their absence is.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months:</strong> 334 people injured, two left with life-changing wounds.

The measure, championed by Councilwoman Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, cleared the chamber in a veto-proof 40-8 vote. The bill's matter title: 'Jaywalking in NYC is set to be legal.' The legislation eliminates the $250 fine for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione testified against the bill, warning, 'Over the last five years, 200 people lost their lives while crossing the street mid-block or against the signal, making up about 34 percent of all pedestrian fatalities.' Mayor Eric Adams neither signed nor vetoed the bill, allowing it to become law. City Hall and NYPD officials continue to urge pedestrians to follow traffic rules. The Department of Transportation must now draft rules to implement the change.
