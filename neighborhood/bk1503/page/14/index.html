Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, representing District 46, voiced support: 'I am happy to support the NYC DOT's relaunch of their "We're Walking Here" campaign to raise awareness of our collective responsibility to eliminate all traffic deaths and serious injuries.' The contest partners with the 'Hip Hop 50' campaign, blending street safety with city culture. Winners receive prizes from The Safe Streets Fund.

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous.

Diego Andrade, a pedestrian, was killed by the driver of a 2016 Mack sanitation truck turning left at E. 14th Street. The driver remained at the scene and faced no charges. The incident happened along a stretch with a history of frequent crashes—41 reported in the previous year on just ten blocks, injuring 13 pedestrians and one cyclist. The Department of Transportation has not addressed the dangers of this corridor since at least 2009. Residents voiced fear and frustration, calling drivers 'crazy' and demanding city action. The area’s councilmember, Inna Vernikov, has a record of repeated speeding violations, adding to the climate of danger. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law’s weak language leaves streets exposed.</p><p class=mb3>Local Law 36 of 2020 created the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, overseen by the Department of Transportation. The law, passed October 26, 2020, aimed to educate repeat traffic offenders. It requires a course for owners with 15 speeding or 5 red-light tickets, but only if DOT chooses. As of November 28, 2022, just 630 drivers completed the course, and only 12 vehicles were seized. The law’s summary promised to 'educate vehicle owners about the dangers resulting from vehicle operators exceeding posted speed limits and failing to comply with traffic signals, including the potential to cause injury or death.' Council Member Inna Vernikov was named as an example of a driver reaching the threshold. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called for more teeth, saying, 'new data shows a clear need for additional investments in the program to get dangerous vehicles off our streets.' The program’s weak enforcement leaves thousands of reckless drivers unpunished, endangering vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The dispute exposed deep rifts over street safety and car dominance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 5, 2022, Councilman Robert F. Holden (District 30) and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards clashed publicly over the MTA's congestion pricing plan. The dispute, reported by nypost.com, began with Holden calling the plan 'another tax on hardworking New Yorkers' and demanding a referendum. Richards retweeted Holden, suggesting an 'actual Democrat' should replace him, and responded to a supporter with 'Yeah white supremacy.' The exchange escalated, drawing condemnation from other officials. The matter centered on the policy to charge motorists entering Manhattan below 60th Street. Holden joined a bipartisan press conference urging Governor Hochul to let voters decide. The spat revealed sharp divides over congestion pricing, with Holden opposing the plan and Richards defending it. No formal council bill or vote was involved, but the fight highlighted the political and racial tensions surrounding street safety and car use in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required NYPD to create a secure website for victims and families to access crash details, including investigation status, summonses, and witness information. It also mandated a Department of Transportation guide for collision victims, outlining rights to police reports and insurance information. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to resources for victims of motor vehicle collisions.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Mercedes Narcisse, and Lincoln Restler backed the bill. The bill was filed at session's end on December 31, 2023, without passage. Without this law, crash victims and their families still face barriers to basic information after life-altering collisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
