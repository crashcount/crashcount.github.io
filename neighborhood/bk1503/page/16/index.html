The plan, a priority for the Adams administration and MTA, aims to speed up the B41 bus from Downtown Brooklyn to Marine Park. Narcisse and Councilmember Rita Joseph joined Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference, riding the B41 and speaking with riders. Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The scooter struck the center back end of the SUV, causing damage to both vehicles. The rider sustained contusions and injuries to his elbow, lower arm, and hand but was conscious and not ejected. The report lists 'Failure to Keep Right' as the primary contributing factor to the crash. The SUV was unoccupied at the time and remained stationary. No other contributing factors such as helmet use or signaling were noted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The driver fled but was later found and issued multiple summonses, though not arrested. The crash site remained clogged with illegally parked cars, many marked with MTA vests and NYPD placards. These blockages forced buses to detour and left cyclists at risk. The neighborhood has no protected bike lanes. Local officials—State Sen. Simcha Felder, Assembly Member Peter Abbate, and Council Member Kalman Yeger—have opposed street safety improvements. Abbate, quoted as saying, "Bicyclists need to wear a helmet and be registered," supports more enforcement against drivers but resists bike infrastructure. He doubts DOT safety data and calls for stricter punishment for dangerous drivers, yet maintains opposition to measures that protect vulnerable road users. The MTA stated employees are not exempt from parking rules. The street remains unsafe for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Rita C. Joseph sponsored the bill, joined by sixteen co-sponsors including Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, and others.

The measure was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023.

The bill aimed to amend the city’s administrative code to increase penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles, including those under and over 10,000 pounds, and for unauthorized horns and claxons. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing certain penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles.' Council Member Sandra Ung sponsored the bill, joined by 26 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. There is no evidence the bill would have improved safety for vulnerable road users. The city’s noise problem, and its threat to livable streets, remains unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
