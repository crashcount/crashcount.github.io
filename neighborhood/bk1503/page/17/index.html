Same ending.</p><ul><li>Four people are dead here since 2022. Hundreds are hurt. Pedestrians take two of the deaths; car occupants take two more, according to city data for Sheepshead Bay–Manhattan Beach–Gerritsen Beach. The worst toll sits on the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Belt Parkway</a>. Two killed. 257 injured.</li><li>A 58-year-old man died walking near the Belt in 2022. A taxi and a sedan hit him. Police logged him as a pedestrian not at an intersection <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4578958)</a>.</li><li>A 57-year-old passenger died in a Belt Parkway pileup in 2023. Seven vehicles. One unlicensed driver among them <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4680397)</a>.</li><li>In 2024, a 77-year-old driver on Ocean Avenue was killed in a three-car crash. He was unconscious at the scene <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4720212)</a>.</li><li>Since then, the injuries keep coming. Pedestrians: 212. Cyclists: 71. Other motorized riders: 43. The data runs through August 24, 2025 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(NYC Open Data rollup)</a>.</li></ul><p>Speed peaks. People break.</p><ul><li>The clock tells a story. Injuries spike in the afternoon. The 4 p.m. hour carries 84 injuries and two deaths. The 5 p.m. hour has 102 injuries. Night doesn’t save you: 9 p.m. shows another death <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(hourly distribution)</a>.</li><li>SUVs lead pedestrian harm here: 93 pedestrian casualties, including one death, tied to SUVs. Sedans follow with 77. A taxi accounts for another pedestrian death <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(causes of pedestrian injuries)</a>.</li><li>“Criminal charges for him were still pending,” police said in one Brooklyn crash covered citywide this month.

One fix.</p><ul><li>The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Belt Parkway</a> is a hotspot. So is <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Ocean Avenue</a>. Oriental Boulevard, too, where a 99-year-old man was killed in a crosswalk area in 2022 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4500449)</a>.</li><li>Contributing factors logged by NYPD put “other” at the top, but the injuries show the shape: inattention, failure to yield, and unsafe speed all appear in the file <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(contributing factors)</a>.</li><li>The fixes are not theory. Daylighting at corners. Hardened turns. Leading pedestrian intervals. Targeted enforcement at the repeat hotspots. The afternoon hours need it most.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>Albany gave the city power to lower speeds. Advocates say use it. “Sammy’s Law gave NYC the power to set safer speeds. Lower our residential speed limit to 20 mph,” our site tells readers to demand <a href=/take_action/>(Take Action)</a>.</li><li>The state is weighing speed limiters for repeat speeders. The bill — <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> — would require intelligent speed assistance after a record of violations. Senators moved it through committee in June <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>(Open States file)</a>. City press has shown what repeat offenders do to families. One Streetsblog analysis ties a small group of drivers to a big share of deaths <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/16/map-quest-meet-the-citys-most-dangerous-drivers-and-where-theyre-preying-on-you>(Streetsblog overview)</a>.</li><li>On the ground, some electeds fought basic visibility. A DOT report against universal daylighting became fuel for opponents, including Council Member Inna Vernikov <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/we-told-you-so-dots-anti-daylighting-scare-tactic-now-fuels-pro-car-pols>(coverage)</a>. Earlier, she pushed DOT to pause bike lanes in Southern Brooklyn <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>(report)</a>.</li></ul><p>The names fade. The corners don’t.</p><ul><li>This year to date, crashes are up about 27% over last year at this time. Injuries are up, too <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(period stats)</a>.</li><li>Peak hours. Same streets. Same toll.</li></ul><p>What now</p><ul><li>Lower the default city speed to 20 mph. Deploy speed limiters for repeat speeders. Fix the corners that do the most harm. The law and the data allow it. The delay costs lives.

The city wants young voices to remind drivers: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><p class=mb3>On February 3, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced the return of the 'We're Walking Here' competition. This program, paused during the pandemic, targets K-12 students across New York City. The contest runs March 6-31, with students creating public-service announcements to promote walking and traffic safety. Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, representing District 46, voiced support: 'I am happy to support the NYC DOT's relaunch of their "We're Walking Here" campaign to raise awareness of our collective responsibility to eliminate all traffic deaths and serious injuries.' The contest partners with the 'Hip Hop 50' campaign, blending street safety with city culture. Winners receive prizes from The Safe Streets Fund. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called students 'some of our most vulnerable pedestrians.' The program aims to put safety in the hands of those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Over 22,000 cars rack up tickets, but only 630 drivers take the safety course. Just 12 vehicles seized. Most repeat offenders keep driving. The law’s weak language leaves streets exposed.</p><p class=mb3>Local Law 36 of 2020 created the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, overseen by the Department of Transportation. The law, passed October 26, 2020, aimed to educate repeat traffic offenders. It requires a course for owners with 15 speeding or 5 red-light tickets, but only if DOT chooses. As of November 28, 2022, just 630 drivers completed the course, and only 12 vehicles were seized. The law’s summary promised to 'educate vehicle owners about the dangers resulting from vehicle operators exceeding posted speed limits and failing to comply with traffic signals, including the potential to cause injury or death.' Council Member Inna Vernikov was named as an example of a driver reaching the threshold. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called for more teeth, saying, 'new data shows a clear need for additional investments in the program to get dangerous vehicles off our streets.' The program’s weak enforcement leaves thousands of reckless drivers unpunished, endangering vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
