Whiplash. She survived, but the pain lingers. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a> shows the pattern: drivers turning, failing to yield, not paying attention.

The streets demand change.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 6808, titled 'Relates to establishing first responder safety zones and setting speed limits in such safety zones,' moved through committee and passed multiple Senate votes between May 2023 and March 2024. Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way. The bill targets that risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This policy, supported by Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, State Senator James Sanders, Jr., Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson, and City Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, addresses a long-standing exclusion in the city's transit network. The City Ticket allows travel within city limits on LIRR or Metro-North for $5 during off-peak and weekend hours. Richards called the move a win for 'transit equity.' Anderson highlighted that Rockaway has the city's longest commutes, and this change will help. Brooks-Powers urged further expansion and easier transfers.

The law, named after Carlos Moncayo, aims to curb a surge in construction worker deaths—22 in the past year, the highest in five years. State Sen. Jessica Ramos, representing District 13, called the law 'critically needed' as thousands of migrants enter non-union construction jobs lacking basic safety protections. Ramos and other lawmakers supported the bill, but advocates and union officials warn that without strong enforcement and education for new arrivals, deaths and injuries will persist. The law passed after years of advocacy, but the minimum fine was removed, and nonprofits struggle to train the influx of new workers.
