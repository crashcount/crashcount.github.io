One serious injury. Four hundred fifty-six injured.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Springfield Gardens (North)-Rochdale Village since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are lives cut short, bodies broken, families changed. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>135 people were hurt</strong> in 211 crashes. No one died this year, but the wounds remain.</p><h3 id=the-latest-wounds>The Latest Wounds</h3><p>A woman crossing 133rd Avenue with the signal. Struck by an SUV making a left turn. Neck injury. Whiplash. She survived, but the pain lingers. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a> shows the pattern: drivers turning, failing to yield, not paying attention. The street is not safe for those on foot—or for anyone.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits. The city can redesign streets, add cameras, slow the cars. But change comes slow. Each day of delay is another day of risk. The city has not yet used its full power. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Residents can call for lower speed limits, more cameras, safer crossings. The city can act. The council can vote. The mayor can lead. But nothing changes until the people demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not words.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Promised bus lanes never come. Mayor Adams broke his pledge. The city built just 9.6 miles in two years. Riders wait. DOT blames funding. Council law ignored. Streets stay deadly. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, released February 7, 2025, by the Independent Budget Office, exposes the city’s failure to meet the Streets Master Plan law (passed in 2019) mandating 150 miles of new bus lanes. The IBO states: 'It will be virtually impossible for the city to meet the City Council's required 150 miles of new bus lanes at the pace Mayor Adams is going.' Mayor Adams, who took office in 2022, has slowed or killed key bus projects, including the Fordham Road busway. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno claims the agency is building protected lanes and using cameras for enforcement, but admits resources are tight. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has called for compliance but not funded it. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein blames hiring freezes and political interference for 'broken promises and neglected legislation.' The report shows that while DOT’s budget grew, staffing for bus lane expansion fell. Bus speeds remain stuck at 8.1 mph. The city’s inaction leaves millions of bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—stranded and exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Common Sense Caucus, known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, led the charge. Progressive members lost key committee seats. Universal daylighting (Intro 1138) and other safety reforms stalled. Council Member Julie Won continued to push for daylighting but faced resistance. As Streetsblog reported, 'roadway safety is simply not a priority.' Advocates and former members criticized the Council for failing to hold the mayor accountable on the Streets Master Plan and for focusing on parking over safety. The Council's actions marked a retreat from previous street safety gains, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a response to 'constituent concerns about the safety hazards created when e-scooters are frequently left on sidewalks and streets, obstructing pedestrians and all road users,' highlights the tension between rising scooter use and street safety. Council spokespersons echoed Adams, citing reckless scooter parking near homes, businesses, and senior centers. The Council press office downplayed ridership, demanding better community engagement and accountability from Lime, Bird, and Veo. The Department of Transportation did not comment. No formal bill number or committee action was reported.

She cites blocked sidewalks and safety fears. Riders and advocates push back, warning a pause will hurt those who rely on scooters for safe, cheap travel.</p><p class=mb3>On October 10, 2024, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams called for an 'immediate operational pause' of the e-scooter share program in eastern Queens. The matter, described as a demand to 'pause' the program due to 'sidewalks allegedly rendered impassible by the micromobility devices,' reflects Adams's concerns about scooters left on sidewalks and streets. She stated, 'My constituents have consistently raised questions and concerns about the safety hazards created when e-scooters are frequently left on sidewalks and streets, obstructing pedestrians and all road users.' Adams's stance opposes the current e-scooter share and expansion of micromobility options, but supports stronger regulation and enforcement. The Department of Transportation and advocates highlight the program's success, with nearly 500,000 trips since launch, and argue for better infrastructure instead of a ban. No formal council vote has occurred; this is a public demand from the Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
