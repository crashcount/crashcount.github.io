Police said the driver "failed to navigate the roadway and struck a tree." Emergency services pronounced him dead at the scene. The NYPD's Highway District Collision Investigation Squad is handling the case, and no arrests have been made.

Adams has supported e-bike registration, which experts warn would harm delivery workers and street safety. She has not acted to hold reckless drivers accountable after the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and has not used Council powers to lower speed limits. Adams oversaw an outdoor dining law that restricted the program, leading to fewer participating restaurants. She has not enforced the Streets Master Plan benchmarks or sued the mayor for noncompliance. Her actions have left vulnerable road users exposed and slowed the city’s progress on Vision Zero.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
