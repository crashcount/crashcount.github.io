A plain sentence. A body on the street.</p><p>The late hours keep taking.</p><ul><li>Injuries spike from 5 p.m. to midnight. At 9 p.m., 35 hurt. At 10 p.m., 33. At 8 p.m., five listed as serious. Two deaths hit at 9 p.m. and 11 p.m., according to the <a href=#>hourly distribution</a> in our dataset, drawn from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</li></ul><p>Three corners.

People live.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany passed a bill to force speed limiters on repeat offenders. The Senate’s S 4045 advanced in June; Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee, twice noted in the record (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>June 11</a>, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>June 12</a>). The measure targets drivers with patterns of violations through intelligent speed assistance.</p><p>The City Council is moving other pieces. A 60‑day mandate to install school‑adjacent traffic devices was introduced and sent to committee on Aug. 14. Council Member Farah N. Louis is listed as sponsor on one item and co‑sponsor on another tied to school‑zone safety timelines (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353-2025</a>).</p><p>The pattern does not wait.</p><ul><li>Since 2022, this area logged 1,488 crashes, 13 serious injuries, and two deaths. Pedestrians: 172 injured, one killed. Cyclists: 73 injured, one killed. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle rollup</a> shows SUVs and sedans driving most harm.</li></ul><p>Slow the cars. Stop the repeats.</p><ul><li>Lower speeds save lives. Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone cameras through 2030, and S 4045 targets the worst repeat speeders (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States file</a>). The city has the power to set lower limits under Sammy’s Law; New Yorkers are pushing it in our own campaign. Act on it.</li></ul><p>Take one step today.

Her resistance stalled the McGuinness Blvd. redesign, leaving pedestrians and cyclists at risk. Only after investigators seized phones did the city revive its safety plan.</p><p class=mb3>This story centers on the McGuinness Boulevard safety redesign, a project to protect pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly Brooklyn street. No council bill number applies, but the saga unfolded across 2023 and 2024, with City Hall’s powerful aide Ingrid Lewis-Martin at the center. The matter: 'What role did a single bike lane play in Ingrid Lewis-Martin's undoing?' Lewis-Martin, Mayor Adams’s closest advisor, fought the road diet and bike lane, siding with Broadway Stages and its CEO Gina Argento, who opposed the plan. Under their pressure, Adams abandoned the Department of Transportation’s safety design. After both women’s phones were seized in a corruption probe, City Hall reversed course and advanced the safety project. The episode exposes how political interference delayed life-saving street changes, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger cut.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1138-2024, now laid over in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced December 5, 2024. The bill states: “prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.” Council Member Erik D. Bottcher leads, joined by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and over two dozen co-sponsors. The law orders the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections each year, up from 100. The city must also run outreach and education. The bill aims to keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike. No more hiding behind parked cars. The committee laid the bill over on April 21, 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law demands 30. Commissioner Rodriguez called it a great job. Critics slammed the city for falling short. Riders wait. Streets stay clogged. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On December 4, 2024, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the agency’s bus lane record before critics. The Streets Master Plan requires 30 new miles of bus lanes each year. In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles—just 17 percent of the legal mandate. Rodriguez claimed, “We are doing a great job,” citing national comparisons and blaming delays on community board processes and local opposition, especially around the 96th Street project. State Sen. Jessica Ramos, Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, and State Sen. Zellnor Myrie condemned the city’s self-praise and legal failure. The matter title reads: ‘We Are Doing A Great Job’ … Falling Short of Bus Lane Requirement. Several projects are planned for 2025, but completion is uncertain. The city’s slow pace leaves bus riders and other vulnerable road users exposed to dangerous, congested streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
