A plain sentence. A body on the street.</p><p>The late hours keep taking.</p><ul><li>Injuries spike from 5 p.m. to midnight. At 9 p.m., 35 hurt. At 10 p.m., 33. At 8 p.m., five listed as serious. Two deaths hit at 9 p.m. and 11 p.m., according to the <a href=#>hourly distribution</a> in our dataset, drawn from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</li></ul><p>Three corners.

The Senate’s S 4045 advanced in June; Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee, twice noted in the record (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>June 11</a>, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>June 12</a>). The measure targets drivers with patterns of violations through intelligent speed assistance.</p><p>The City Council is moving other pieces. A 60‑day mandate to install school‑adjacent traffic devices was introduced and sent to committee on Aug. 14. Council Member Farah N. Louis is listed as sponsor on one item and co‑sponsor on another tied to school‑zone safety timelines (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353-2025</a>).</p><p>The pattern does not wait.</p><ul><li>Since 2022, this area logged 1,488 crashes, 13 serious injuries, and two deaths. Pedestrians: 172 injured, one killed. Cyclists: 73 injured, one killed. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle rollup</a> shows SUVs and sedans driving most harm.</li></ul><p>Slow the cars. Stop the repeats.</p><ul><li>Lower speeds save lives. Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone cameras through 2030, and S 4045 targets the worst repeat speeders (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States file</a>). The city has the power to set lower limits under Sammy’s Law; New Yorkers are pushing it in our own campaign. Act on it.</li></ul><p>Take one step today.

"That destroys our catch basins because they don’t get clean."" -- Brian Cunningham</p><p class=mb3>The 2025 Albany legislative session ended June 25, with lawmakers failing to pass key street safety bills. The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress.

The city must wait until an August hearing before making changes. The ruling follows a lawsuit by Transportation Alternatives, who argued Adams 'abused his discretion' by ordering the lane reverted to its unprotected design. The city had cited community feedback and a viral video of a child struck by an e-bike as reasons for removal. The Department of Transportation installed the protected lane after five pedestrian deaths in 2021 and 2022. Local lawmakers protested the removal, calling the process hasty. The judge’s order keeps the safety improvements in place, pausing the city’s plan to restore curbside parking and expose cyclists to traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states: "The car is driven by multiple people, all of whom have been reminded to obey the speed limit, and there are no outstanding tickets." Cuomo’s spokesperson, Esther Jensen, noted his past support for speed cameras. Mayoral rival Brad Lander and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani criticized Cuomo’s record, calling his driving 'reckless and unlawful.' Zellnor Myrie’s spokesperson, Julia Rose, said Cuomo acts above the law. The safety analyst notes: this event describes an individual's driving and parking behavior but does not constitute a policy change or legislation affecting population-level safety for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He highlighted blocked bike lanes, rising injuries, and the lack of protected infrastructure. Myrie voiced support for congestion pricing, safer streets, and reducing car dependency.
