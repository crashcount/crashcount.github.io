The plans are real. The rollout is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> It has not used it. Speed cameras save lives, but Albany lets the law hang by a thread. Each day of delay is a risk paid in blood.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action-not-excuses>What Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand intersection redesigns now, not next year. Demand that speed cameras stay on. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Joseph, in a joint statement with Transportation Alternatives, said, "The tragic death of yet another cyclist in our city, this time in my own neighborhood, shows how far we need to come to address traffic violence." Joseph called for urgent action to make streets safer. Parkside Avenue, not a designated truck route, has seen 161 injuries in five years, including 28 cyclists and 25 pedestrians. Advocates, including Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives, demanded the city fast-track protected bike lanes, warning, "Lives are on the line." The city has completed eight miles of protected lanes this year, with a goal of 20 by January. The push for protected infrastructure follows a spike in traffic deaths and ongoing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Staff would answer traffic requests fast, matching team size to borough need. The bill died at session’s end. Streets stay slow to change. Danger lingers for walkers and riders.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0745-2022 was introduced to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 29, 2022. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to creating borough-based traffic request response teams.” Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Gale A. Brewer, and Rafael Salamanca, Jr. backed the measure. The bill required the Department of Transportation to assign staff to each borough, with numbers based on local traffic request volume, and respond within three months. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The bill’s failure means slow action on street fixes. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while requests pile up.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
