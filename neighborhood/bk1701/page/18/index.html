He died at the scene, per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a>. The vehicle was a Volvo tractor-trailer. The pedestrian was listed as killed. The crash time: 9 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4586191</a>.</li><li>Near New York Avenue and Cortelyou Road, a 53-year-old bicyclist was killed around 11:10 p.m. The record cites a traffic control disregarded.

A plain sentence. A body on the street.</p><p>The late hours keep taking.</p><ul><li>Injuries spike from 5 p.m. to midnight. At 9 p.m., 35 hurt. At 10 p.m., 33. At 8 p.m., five listed as serious. Two deaths hit at 9 p.m. and 11 p.m., according to the <a href=#>hourly distribution</a> in our dataset, drawn from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>Tilden Avenue logs five serious injuries, the most in the area. <a href=#>Tilden Ave</a> shows up as a top hotspot in the data. Rogers and Nostrand rack up dozens of injuries too.

One pedestrian death from a truck. The neighborhood’s toll since 2022: two deaths — one pedestrian, one bicyclist — and 919 injured, per our <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>local rollup</a>.</li></ul><p>Local fixes now.</p><ul><li>Daylight the corners on Rogers, Nostrand, and Tilden. Harden turns. Give leading pedestrian intervals. These basics match the risk the records show: failure to yield, inattention, backing, and nighttime conditions dominate the listings in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>contributing factors</a>.</li><li>Target the late-night hours. The cluster from 8 p.m.–11 p.m. is plain in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly data</a>. Focus there. People live.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany passed a bill to force speed limiters on repeat offenders. The Senate’s S 4045 advanced in June; Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee, twice noted in the record (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>June 11</a>, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>June 12</a>). The measure targets drivers with patterns of violations through intelligent speed assistance.</p><p>The City Council is moving other pieces. A 60‑day mandate to install school‑adjacent traffic devices was introduced and sent to committee on Aug. 14. Council Member Farah N. Louis is listed as sponsor on one item and co‑sponsor on another tied to school‑zone safety timelines (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353-2025</a>).</p><p>The pattern does not wait.</p><ul><li>Since 2022, this area logged 1,488 crashes, 13 serious injuries, and two deaths. Pedestrians: 172 injured, one killed. Cyclists: 73 injured, one killed. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle rollup</a> shows SUVs and sedans driving most harm.</li></ul><p>Slow the cars. Stop the repeats.</p><ul><li>Lower speeds save lives. Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone cameras through 2030, and S 4045 targets the worst repeat speeders (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States file</a>). The city has the power to set lower limits under Sammy’s Law; New Yorkers are pushing it in our own campaign. Act on it.</li></ul><p>Take one step today. Go to our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page. Ask City Hall for a 20 mph default and demand the state finish the job on speed limiters.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
