Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In the last year alone, 232 people were hurt. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers keep coming.

The plans are real. The rollout is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> It has not used it.

Each day of delay is a risk paid in blood.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action-not-excuses>What Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand intersection redesigns now, not next year.

The city upgraded 1,400 intersections, expanded speed and red-light cameras, and opened 46 new open streets, including Paseo Park. Adams pledged $904 million for the Streets Master Plan but missed year-one requirements. Council Member Rita Joseph praised plans for a Flatbush Avenue bus lane, while advocates like Elizabeth Adams called the lack of progress 'a troubling sign.'

The letter states, 'E-bikes are legal to ride on New York City streets and make moving around the city more accessible without adding more pollution and congestion.' The council members oppose the Parks Department’s policy that classifies e-bikes as motor vehicles, grouping them with SUVs and trucks. They argue this ban blocks access for delivery workers, families, older adults, and people with limited transit options. The lawmakers call for a new policy that permits e-bikes while addressing safety concerns, insisting the current rule undermines city values of accessibility and environmental care.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
