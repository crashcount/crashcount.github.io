Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In the last year alone, 232 people were hurt. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers keep coming.

The plans are real. The rollout is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> It has not used it.

Each day of delay is a risk paid in blood.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action-not-excuses>What Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand intersection redesigns now, not next year.

Her Audi struck a family, killing a mother and two small children. Police said Yarimi was 'reportedly speeding, ran a red light, and struck the family.' Prosecutors allege she told first responders she was possessed at the time. The article details Yarimi’s history as a victim of sexual abuse by a former NYPD officer, but the crash itself highlights systemic failures: a suspended license, unchecked speed, and a fatal intersection.

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws. Some opposition remains, but supporters say the measure is urgent and practical.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
