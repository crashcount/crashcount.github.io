Each day of delay is a risk paid in blood.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action-not-excuses>What Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand intersection redesigns now, not next year.

The bill requires police officers patrolling subway stations to carry and distribute flyers about city-run reduced fare programs to anyone arrested or summoned for fare evasion. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to providing information on the reduced fare programs to persons issued a summons for fare evasion.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Brooks-Powers, Brewer, Dinowitz, Barron, Krishnan, and others. The flyers must explain eligibility, discount details, and application steps. The law took effect 120 days after passage. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was noted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the police department to report on the justification for the stop in vehicle encounter reports," demands the NYPD document every vehicle stop. Reports must include the reason for the stop, the level of offense, and demographic details, but no personal identifiers. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and others led the charge. The law aims to expose patterns in police stops and holds officers to account. Reports go online, open to all. This is a step toward transparency, not just for drivers, but for every New Yorker who walks, rides, or waits at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
