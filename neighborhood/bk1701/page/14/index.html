Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In the last year alone, 232 people were hurt. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers keep coming.

The plans are real. The rollout is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> It has not used it.

Each day of delay is a risk paid in blood.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action-not-excuses>What Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand intersection redesigns now, not next year.

Councilmember Rita Joseph demands answers. Streets with schools see more crashes, more injuries. The agency refuses to break out costs or salaries. Families and advocates call for transparency. Children remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On January 25, 2023, the City Council, led by Education Committee Chair Rita Joseph (District 40), pressed the Department of Transportation for transparency on school street safety spending. The matter, titled 'How Much Does DOT Spend to Keep Kids Safe Outside of Schools? The Agency Won’t Say,' exposes DOT’s refusal to disclose project costs or School Safety Unit salaries. Joseph expressed disappointment: 'New Yorkers deserve to know how the DOT is working to make school streets safer.' Councilmember Shahana Hanif also criticized DOT’s inability to track safety projects. Despite Commissioner Rodriguez’s promise of 100 safety projects, the agency denied a FOIL request, claiming costs are not tracked. Advocates and families condemned the lack of accountability. The Department of Education also refused to comment. The city’s silence leaves children exposed on dangerous streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams promised 300 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of bus lanes by 2025. In 2022, his administration delivered 25 miles of protected bike lanes and 11.95 miles of new or camera-protected bus lanes—far short of annual goals. The city upgraded 1,400 intersections, expanded speed and red-light cameras, and opened 46 new open streets, including Paseo Park. Adams pledged $904 million for the Streets Master Plan but missed year-one requirements. Council Member Rita Joseph praised plans for a Flatbush Avenue bus lane, while advocates like Elizabeth Adams called the lack of progress 'a troubling sign.' Enforcement against reckless drivers and placard abuse remained weak. Citi Bike expansion stalled in some neighborhoods.
