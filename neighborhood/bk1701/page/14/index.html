The measures, now headed to Mayor Eric Adams, require the Department of Transportation to report on traffic violence more often and to install traffic calming devices in areas with many senior pedestrians. The matter summary reads: 'Traffic calming devices that are designed to slow down traffic will now be mandated in parts of the five boroughs where a large number of senior citizens reside as the city plans to speed up part of its response to serious and fatal car crashes.' Speaker Adrienne Adams voted for the bills, stating, 'It's important that the Council advance equitable policies like the legislation we're voting on today to ensure that all New Yorkers can live, work and commute on safer streets.' Councilmember Rita C. Joseph, sponsor of the senior zones bill, said, 'It is our duty as this Council to take action to protect our most vulnerable residents.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, sponsor of the crash data bill, said the legislation 'would increase transparency, aid collaboration and help prevent traffic violence.'

The session included Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, who supported the measures. The bills, as summarized, would require the Department of Transportation to create pedestrian zones for seniors, install traffic calming devices, increase the frequency of serious crash studies, and implement 'daylighting'—removing parking near intersections—at 100 sites starting January 1, 2025. The matter title reads: 'NYC Council tackles bills on policing, homeless rights and charity gambling.' Narcisse is listed as a sponsor. These actions aim to cut risk for pedestrians and seniors, especially at dangerous crossings. The council’s stance is clear: support for pedestrian safety zones, traffic calming, more crash studies, and daylighting.

The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the Council, 'We love Lincoln Restler's bill,' and called the old law 'unnecessarily burdensome.' The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster.

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0549-2023, filed at session’s end, came from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced April 11, 2023, and pushed by Council Member Shahana K. Hanif as primary sponsor, with Jennifer Gutiérrez and over twenty others co-sponsoring. The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ ... and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' The SAFE Streets Act package also includes safe passing for cyclists and complete street design mandates. The Council’s action highlights the city’s ongoing fight against reckless driving and the urgent need for stronger protections for people on foot, on bikes, and in cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
