A black car hits him. The driver flees. Another car runs him over. He dies the next day. Police are still looking for the first driver. No arrests. No answers.

Two were seriously hurt.</strong> No one died in that span, but death is never far. In three years, two people have died on these streets. Children bleed here. Elders fall. The numbers pile up. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=the-shape-of-harm>The Shape of Harm</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and cars caused 30 moderate or serious pedestrian injuries. Trucks and buses hurt two more. Motorcycles and mopeds injured two. No bikes killed or seriously hurt anyone, but the city still talks about helmet laws and crosswalk rules. The danger comes on four wheels, heavy and fast.</p><h2 id=promises-and-silence>Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city says it wants zero deaths. It says every life matters. But Linden Boulevard stays wide and fast. Farmers Boulevard stays deadly. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The council can act. The mayor can act. They wait.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The law requires the Department of Transportation to publish a monthly-updated, searchable map of all city bike lanes. The map must show obstructions, construction, crash patterns, shared paths, conflict points, resurfacing, parking, bike share docks, open streets, repair shops, and reporting tools. The bill’s matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to develop a map of bicycle infrastructure conditions.' Council Member Crystal Hudson sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Sanchez, Stevens, Yeger, Restler, Avilés, and others. The law brings sunlight to hidden hazards, giving vulnerable road users the facts they need to see the city’s dangers in plain sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by 21 co-sponsors including Williams, Hanif, and Yeger. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided, but the measure aimed to end secrecy around life-saving street changes.

The law requires the Department of Transportation to 'implement daylighting at a minimum of 100 intersections a year,' meaning no parking within 15 feet of corners. High-crash intersections must be prioritized unless deemed infeasible. DOT must also install physical daylighting features, such as planters or bike corrals, where possible. Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hudson, Ossé, and others. The law took effect 90 days after enactment. DOT must report annually on locations and reasons for any exceptions.
