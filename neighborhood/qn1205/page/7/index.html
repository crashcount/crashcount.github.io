A black car hits him. The driver flees. Another car runs him over. He dies the next day. Police are still looking for the first driver. No arrests. No answers.

Two were seriously hurt.</strong> No one died in that span, but death is never far. In three years, two people have died on these streets. Children bleed here. Elders fall. The numbers pile up. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=the-shape-of-harm>The Shape of Harm</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and cars caused 30 moderate or serious pedestrian injuries. Trucks and buses hurt two more. Motorcycles and mopeds injured two. No bikes killed or seriously hurt anyone, but the city still talks about helmet laws and crosswalk rules. The danger comes on four wheels, heavy and fast.</p><h2 id=promises-and-silence>Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city says it wants zero deaths. It says every life matters. But Linden Boulevard stays wide and fast. Farmers Boulevard stays deadly. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The council can act. The mayor can act. They wait.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.
