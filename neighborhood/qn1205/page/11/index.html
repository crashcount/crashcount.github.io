A black car hits him. The driver flees. Another car runs him over. He dies the next day. Police are still looking for the first driver. No arrests. No answers.

The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=the-shape-of-harm>The Shape of Harm</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and cars caused 30 moderate or serious pedestrian injuries. Trucks and buses hurt two more. Motorcycles and mopeds injured two. No bikes killed or seriously hurt anyone, but the city still talks about helmet laws and crosswalk rules. The danger comes on four wheels, heavy and fast.</p><h2 id=promises-and-silence>Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city says it wants zero deaths. It says every life matters. But Linden Boulevard stays wide and fast. Farmers Boulevard stays deadly. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph.

The matter summary states: 'This bill would prohibit commercial establishments from parking vehicles on city streets as part of their business.' Civil penalties ranged from $250 to $400 per day, with possible impoundment. Sponsors included Kalman Yeger (primary), Carlina Rivera, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kevin C. Riley, Marjorie Velázquez, Erik D. Bottcher, Nantasha M. Williams, and Robert F. Holden. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst assessment was provided.
