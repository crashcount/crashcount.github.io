Another, a young man, age 24, lost on 34th Avenue. A motorcyclist, age 37, did not make it home from 40th Avenue. A woman, 37, died on 34th Avenue. The names are not here.

The street does not care about age.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm.</strong> In the last three years, sedans and SUVs caused 24 moderate injuries to pedestrians.

They talk about lowering speed limits. They talk about cameras and enforcement. But here, the numbers do not move fast enough. <strong>In the last year, injuries fell by 43%. Deaths dropped from one to zero.</strong> But the crashes keep coming—110 so far this year. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have the power to keep speed cameras running.</strong> They have the power to build streets that do not kill. But power unused is nothing.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.

The fight moves to City Planning.</p><p class=mb3>On November 7, 2022, Queens Community Board 2 passed a resolution rejecting a rezoning application for a Lincoln SUV dealership on Northern Boulevard, Woodside. The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pedestrians wait for action.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 0578-2022, introduced July 14, 2022, aimed to amend city law to improve safety at pedestrian crossings. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reviewed it, but the bill was filed without passage at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to improving safety at pedestrian crossings in the city.' Council Members Robert F. Holden (primary sponsor), Ari Kagan, Justin L. Brannan, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Sandy Nurse, Kalman Yeger, Rita C. Joseph, and Tiffany Cabán sponsored the bill. It would have required DOT to audit the city’s deadliest intersections and consider installing leading pedestrian intervals and exclusive pedestrian phases—signals proven to protect people on foot. The bill’s failure leaves dangerous crossings unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
