The decision ended funding for the MTA's pilot program that made one bus route in each borough free. The matter, titled 'NYC to get a boost in bus service, but pilot program for free routes ends,' highlights the trade-off: more buses, but no more free rides. Councilmember Kamillah Hanks of District 49 introduced a resolution urging the MTA to install at least 30 OMNY card vending machines in every borough, noting not all riders can pay by smartphone. The bill is not tied to a specific council committee or number. Hanks is mentioned for her advocacy on OMNY access. The move increases bus frequency but leaves low-income and cash riders behind.

Instead, $12.3 million was set aside to improve bus frequency, far short of the $45 million needed for expansion. The bill’s summary states, 'The MTA's experiment in fare-less city bus service will soon end after Albany lawmakers did not reauthorize it.' Gianaris pledged to keep fighting for affordable transit. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the pilot 'crucial' for working-class New Yorkers. The MTA’s Janno Lieber criticized the program. No safety analyst reviewed the impact on vulnerable road users.

The Adams administration, through spokesperson Liz Garcia, claimed progress: 'We continue to work with our partners in the MTA and with communities across the city to build on this record of success.' But the numbers tell a harsher story. Bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. Riders, many with no other option, face longer waits and slower trips. The city’s failure to build bus lanes leaves streets more dangerous for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'lawlessness on the greenway,' has seen police ignore months of resident complaints. Won, through Chief of Staff Nick Gulotta, demanded the Parks Department install fencing and bollards to block cars. 'Council Member Won fully supports the call for the Parks Department to install fencing and bollards to prevent cars from illegally parking and driving through the Queensbridge Baby Park Greenway,' Gulotta said. The Parks Department claims to be working on a 'barricade plan' with NYCHA, but offers no timeline. The greenway, once a haven for pedestrians and cyclists, now serves as a parking lot. The NYPD and Parks Department pass blame. Vulnerable road users remain exposed. The system fails to protect them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates want more than fewer cars. They demand free transit, faster buses, wide bike lanes, and car-free school streets. The plan targets space now wasted on traffic. The goal: safer, freer movement for all New Yorkers.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion statement, published March 21, 2024, in Streetsblog NYC, lays out a vision for maximizing the impact of congestion pricing in New York City. Sara Lind, speaking for her organization, urges city and state leaders to seize the moment. She calls for free bus and ferry rides during the first week, dedicated bus lanes, double-wide bike lanes on major avenues, and car-free streets near schools. The statement reads: 'Congestion pricing isn't important only because it will reduce the number of cars below 60th Street in Manhattan; its true value lies in what else we can get when that happens.' No council bill number or committee is attached, as this is an advocacy statement. The proposals center vulnerable road users—children, cyclists, bus riders—by demanding space and safety where cars once ruled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
