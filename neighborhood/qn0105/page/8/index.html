Another, a young man, age 24, lost on 34th Avenue. A motorcyclist, age 37, did not make it home from 40th Avenue. A woman, 37, died on 34th Avenue. The names are not here.

The street does not care about age.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm.</strong> In the last three years, sedans and SUVs caused 24 moderate injuries to pedestrians.

They talk about lowering speed limits. They talk about cameras and enforcement. But here, the numbers do not move fast enough. <strong>In the last year, injuries fell by 43%. Deaths dropped from one to zero.</strong> But the crashes keep coming—110 so far this year. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have the power to keep speed cameras running.</strong> They have the power to build streets that do not kill. But power unused is nothing.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.

The plan, requested by Council Member Julie Won, Community Board 2, and the Blissville Civic Association, aims to build protected bike lanes, painted lanes, and safer intersections in industrial neighborhoods near Newtown Creek. The DOT’s summary states the project will bring 'vital bike connectivity' to areas with high injury and fatality rates for pedestrians and cyclists. Reilly Owens, CB2 transportation chair, praised the plan: 'It is nice when DOT presents something to us that's just completely wonderful.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives called the area unsafe: 'There's a lot of trucks and other industrial activity and no protection for cyclists.' Some local businesses oppose the project, demanding more studies, but civic leaders and advocates support it for safety and access.

The $368 million project, led by the MTA, replaced century-old signals with Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC), aiming for faster, more reliable service. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) praised the MTA’s handling and shuttle bus communication but criticized the city for not creating dedicated bus lanes during the closure, saying, 'They expressed dismay, however, that the city had not constructed a dedicated lane so shuttle buses could move faster.' Restler called for renewed investment in the MTA, including the resumption of congestion pricing, to fund future upgrades. The project continues through 2027, but no more full shutdowns are planned.

The matter summary: 'DOT Rejects 24-7 Open Street for ‘Bedford Slip,’ Preferring Weekend-Only Hours.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Rep. Nydia Velázquez supported a permanent plaza. Katie Denny Horowitz of the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance vowed to keep pushing for full-time closure. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno said the agency is working with residents on a long-term vision. Most local households rely on transit, biking, or walking.

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report identifies 'Turning Improperly' as the primary contributing factor, pointing directly to driver error in maneuvering the turn. No other contributing factors or victim behaviors were noted. This collision underscores the dangers of improper turning maneuvers in busy urban streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Years of delays left walkers and cyclists squeezed, colliding daily. City leaders promise a safer crossing by summer’s end. Motorists keep four lanes. Vulnerable users finally get space.</p><p class=mb3>On July 30, 2024, the Department of Transportation (DOT) began construction to convert the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway into a pedestrian-only lane. The project, first promised in 2017 and announced by former Mayor Bill de Blasio for completion in 2022, faced years of delays. Council Member Julie Won stated, “After years of delays, broken promises, and missed deadlines, construction...has finally begun.” The DOT’s plan aims to separate nearly 3,000 daily pedestrians and 7,000 cyclists, who have long shared a cramped, dangerous path. Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives said, “The city has been on notice for years about this problem and it is their responsibility to provide a safe facility for walking and biking.” Crashes and injuries continued as the city prioritized car traffic, keeping the lane open to drivers during bridge rehab. The new pedestrian path, with added fencing and sidewalk extensions, promises overdue safety for those on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
