Another, a young man, age 24, lost on 34th Avenue. A motorcyclist, age 37, did not make it home from 40th Avenue. A woman, 37, died on 34th Avenue. The names are not here.

They talk about lowering speed limits. They talk about cameras and enforcement. But here, the numbers do not move fast enough. <strong>In the last year, injuries fell by 43%. Deaths dropped from one to zero.</strong> But the crashes keep coming—110 so far this year. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph.

The bill sought to 'prohibit the sale or distribution of fraudulent license plates, including fraudulent temporary license plates,' and to ban materials that obscure plates. Civil penalties ranged from $300 to $2,000. Council Member Marjorie Velázquez led as primary sponsor, joined by Feliz, Restler, Yeger, Menin, Schulman, and many others. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst reviewed its impact for vulnerable road users.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) declined, offering only daylighting and crosswalk improvements. The matter, highlighted on February 26, 2023, drew support from Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Mike Gianaris, and Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez Rojas. Caban said, “We have to be bigger and we have to be bolder. We have to be thinking about traffic-calming measures across all of our intersections.” Advocates and officials criticized DOT’s reactive approach and urged proactive, community-driven safety changes.

The event, covered by amny.com, called for a $300 million boost to the governor's plan, aiming to cut subway headways to six minutes, make buses free, and avoid fare hikes. The coalition, including the Riders Alliance and TWU Local 100, argued that current service leaves riders waiting over ten minutes and crawling on slow buses. Mamdani, prime sponsor of the Fix the MTA package, said, 'They are at risk of being priced out of one of their most basic human rights, the right to go around their city.' He pushed for higher corporate taxes to fund these improvements. TWU Local 100 president Richard Davis and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams also spoke out against service cuts. The governor's office did not endorse Mamdani's tax proposal.
