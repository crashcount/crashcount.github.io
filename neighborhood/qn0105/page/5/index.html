Another, a young man, age 24, lost on 34th Avenue. A motorcyclist, age 37, did not make it home from 40th Avenue. A woman, 37, died on 34th Avenue. The names are not here. The numbers are. <strong>Four dead.

Seven were under 18. Three were over 75. The street does not care about age.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm.</strong> In the last three years, sedans and SUVs caused 24 moderate injuries to pedestrians. Mopeds and motorcycles hit five. One bus, one bike. The rest is silence.</p><h3 id=what-has-changedand-what-hasnt>What Has Changed—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about lowering speed limits. They talk about cameras and enforcement. But here, the numbers do not move fast enough. <strong>In the last year, injuries fell by 43%. Deaths dropped from one to zero.</strong> But the crashes keep coming—110 so far this year. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have the power to keep speed cameras running.</strong> They have the power to build streets that do not kill. But power unused is nothing.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Assemblymember Robert Carroll (District 44) voiced support for increasing the congestion toll, stating it should come before his earlier $3 delivery fee proposal.

Senate and Assembly leaders have not chosen a revenue source. Carroll’s stance: 'increasing the congestion toll should come first.'

The session saw progressives sidelined as the Council prioritized car-centric bills, including Intros 103 and 104 (parking protection) and hearings on Intro 606 (e-bike registration). The Common Sense Caucus, known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, led the charge. Progressive members lost key committee seats. Universal daylighting (Intro 1138) and other safety reforms stalled. Council Member Julie Won continued to push for daylighting but faced resistance. As Streetsblog reported, 'roadway safety is simply not a priority.' Advocates and former members criticized the Council for failing to hold the mayor accountable on the Streets Master Plan and for focusing on parking over safety.

The report, discussed in the Transportation Committee, found higher injury rates at intersections where parking is banned, but DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton, admitted they could not prove daylighting causes more injuries. The matter summary states: 'Universal daylighting, as evidenced in DOT’s hydrant zone analysis, does not have the widespread safety benefits anticipated and may have negative effects on safety.' Councilmember Julie Won, the bill’s sponsor, argued, 'That could've been prevented with universal daylighting,' referencing children killed by traffic violence. The bill has 20 co-sponsors. Advocates and researchers, including Marcel Moran and Alex Morano, criticized the report’s lack of data and focus on negatives, noting no city has improved safety by blocking visibility. The report’s timing drew skepticism as cities like San Francisco and Hoboken have seen safety gains from daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study’s summary: 'simply removing parking or adding signage had little or even negative impact on safety, with injury rates 30% higher at intersections with only hydrant zones.' Won said, 'Daylighting must be supplemented with hardened barriers like planters and boulders.' DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton warned that sign-only daylighting can actually increase danger by letting drivers speed through wider turns.
