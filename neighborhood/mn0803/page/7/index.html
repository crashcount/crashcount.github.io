A 19-year-old male bicyclist, wearing a helmet, was riding eastbound when he was struck by a 2025 Chevrolet SUV making a left turn. The point of impact was the SUV's left front bumper. The cyclist was ejected and sustained head abrasions, classified as injury severity level 3. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors on the cyclist's part, but the primary cause was the SUV driver's failure to maintain attention while turning. The cyclist was conscious after the crash. Vehicle damage was limited to the SUV's left front bumper.

The matter, titled "MTA eyes new taxes, fees to plug $33B budget hole — even after NYC’s $9 congestion toll!", landed in the spotlight after the new toll failed to close the gap. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, district 35, formally objected to the unfunded capital plan with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. Their joint letter blocked the plan’s January 1 start, forcing negotiations. Governor Hochul, who backs the $68 billion plan, promised no income tax hikes but left other taxes and fees on the table. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called for transparency. The MTA’s future—and the safety of those who rely on it—hangs in the balance.
