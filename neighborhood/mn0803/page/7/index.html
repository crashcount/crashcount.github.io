The project, delayed for over a year, is set for completion in late summer 2024. Safety upgrades include a concrete landing, median, sidewalk extensions, and new bike lanes. Council Member Julie Menin supports the project, calling the overdue walkway 'a serious safety concern and impediment to movement for both pedestrians and cyclists.' Menin pressed DOT to 'strictly adhere to the promised timeline' and provide frequent updates. The project aims to end years of conflict and injury on the bridge’s narrow shared path, where multiple crashes have harmed vulnerable road users since 2021.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Inna Vernikov led as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Farías, Riley, Brannan, and many others. The bill was laid over in committee on December 11, 2024. The measure aims to track these vehicles, but its impact on vulnerable road users remains unassessed.

Council Member Kamillah Hanks leads as primary sponsor, joined by Stevens, Schulman, Menin, Salaam, Brewer, Marte, and others, including a request from the Bronx Borough President. The bill is for 'informational purposes only,' but the impact is clear: families and advocates will finally see where the city leaves children exposed. The measure forces transparency.

Public Advocate Jumaane Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Alexa Avilés, Shekar Krishnan, Amanda Farías, and over twenty others.

Hanif (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, and Julie Menin, the bill demands the city identify intersections with the most pedestrian crashes. The official summary states: “Curb extensions prohibit parking near crosswalks at an intersection, increasing pedestrian visibility.” The law would force curb extensions—no parking within 15 feet of crosswalks—at a minimum of five dangerous intersections per borough, every year. Hanif, Hudson, and Menin push for concrete change. The bill’s language is blunt: visibility saves lives. City agencies must oversee and evaluate.

Law aims to protect lives, streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2024, the City Council passed a package of bills led by Councilmember Gale A. Brewer (District 6). The legislation, heard in committee and passed on this date, increases penalties for businesses selling uncertified e-bikes and scooters with dangerous lithium-ion batteries. Brewer said, 'We are not only going after the batteries, we are going after the stores that are selling the batteries.' The FDNY will now assist the Department of Consumer and Worker Protections in enforcement. Fines for repeat violators can reach $2,000. Brewer’s second bill requires e-bike sellers to post safety information in stores and online, with fines up to $350. Councilmember Julie Menin sponsored additional reforms easing street vendor regulations and banning vending in bike lanes. The bills respond to a deadly spike in battery fires—18 killed in 2023, triple the previous year. Lawmakers aim to protect vulnerable road users and workers who rely on these devices.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
