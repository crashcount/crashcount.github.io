Twenty-nine left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Brooklyn CB9 since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. In the last twelve months alone, two people were killed and nine suffered serious injuries. One was a child. One was over 100 years old. The streets do not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Just last month, an 8-year-old boy was killed by an SUV on Eastern Parkway.</strong> A 101-year-old woman died crossing with the signal on Montgomery Street. The driver was unlicensed. The car was new. The law did not stop him. The street did not protect her. The numbers keep coming: 1,854 injuries, 3,187 crashes. Most victims are on foot.</p><h2 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> Three deaths, 291 injuries, and 82 serious injuries came from sedans and SUVs. Trucks and buses added more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own scars. The pattern is clear. The pain is not shared equally. Pedestrians and children pay the highest price.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk. Streets Stay Deadly.</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Rita Joseph co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines for people on foot. The bill sits in committee. It has not become law. See the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill&rsquo;s status</a>.</p><p>State Senator Zellnor Myrie talks about safer streets. He promises more protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and enforcement. &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>he said after a ride through Brooklyn</a>. But promises do not slow cars. Votes do. Myrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>missed key committee votes</a> on bills to curb repeat speeders and protect school zones.</p><h2 id=the-price-of-delay>The Price of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every delay is a death sentence for someone.</strong> &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said a Brooklyn State Senator after another fatal crash</a>.</p><h2 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Tell them to pass and enforce real street safety laws.</strong> Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list. The blood is already on the street.

The officer, accused of speeding and running a red light, was placed on modified duty. The Internal Affairs Bureau and the state Attorney General opened investigations. The NYPD refused to release crash details or the officer's name. Council Member Crystal Hudson issued a blistering statement demanding the officer's termination, not desk duty. The matter summary states, 'The police officer who was driving the NYPD vehicle that fatally struck a man...has been placed on modified duty.' The NYPD's lack of transparency is routine. Truths surface only after lawsuits. In 2020, vehicle crashes cost the city $142 million. Police settlements are a heavy burden. The system shields its own, leaving families to seek answers in court.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
