Twenty-nine left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Brooklyn CB9 since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. In the last twelve months alone, two people were killed and nine suffered serious injuries. One was a child. One was over 100 years old. The streets do not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Just last month, an 8-year-old boy was killed by an SUV on Eastern Parkway.</strong> A 101-year-old woman died crossing with the signal on Montgomery Street. The driver was unlicensed. The car was new. The law did not stop him. The street did not protect her. The numbers keep coming: 1,854 injuries, 3,187 crashes. Most victims are on foot.</p><h2 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> Three deaths, 291 injuries, and 82 serious injuries came from sedans and SUVs. Trucks and buses added more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own scars. The pattern is clear. The pain is not shared equally. Pedestrians and children pay the highest price.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk. Streets Stay Deadly.</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Rita Joseph co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines for people on foot. The bill sits in committee. It has not become law. See the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill&rsquo;s status</a>.</p><p>State Senator Zellnor Myrie talks about safer streets. He promises more protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and enforcement. &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>he said after a ride through Brooklyn</a>. But promises do not slow cars. Votes do.

We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said a Brooklyn State Senator after another fatal crash</a>.</p><h2 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Tell them to pass and enforce real street safety laws.</strong> Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list. The blood is already on the street.

Both drivers remained at the scene. No arrests have been made. The NYPD Highway Collision Investigation Squad continues to review the crash.

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment. The debate exposes a city divided on how to protect its most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

We need leadership that's not afraid to stand up for us, or stand up against Donald Trump."" -- Zellnor Myrie</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration withdrew federal approval for New York City's congestion pricing program. U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy cited burdens on working-class drivers and questioned the legality of using toll revenue for transit. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit to challenge the move, arguing the program is settled law and already reduces congestion. State Senators Andrew Gounardes and Zellnor Myrie condemned the action, warning, 'Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system.' The withdrawal aligns with New Jersey's opposition and threatens transit upgrades like elevators for elderly and disabled riders. Local officials and advocates say ending congestion pricing will harm vulnerable road users and worsen street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter reads: 'Mandates the use of advanced safety technology in vehicles in the state; requires the commissioner of motor vehicles to promulgate certain rules and regulations.' Brian Cunningham leads as primary sponsor, joined by Steven Raga, Chris Burdick, Tony Simone, Manny De Los Santos, Jen Lunsford, and Jo Anne Simon. The bill aims to force carmakers and drivers to adopt life-saving tech.
