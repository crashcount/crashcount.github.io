It leads this district in harm, with three deaths and 221 injuries since 2022, more than any other corridor here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). A 53‑year‑old man died at the intersection in 2022. Police cited driver distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4517159</a>). A 56‑year‑old man was killed that fall near Schenectady. Police listed unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4575837</a>). This June, an 8‑year‑old boy died at Albany Avenue. An SUV going straight hit him in the crosswalk at the intersection. The dataset records “apparent death” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4823788</a>).</p><p>Across Brooklyn CB9 since 2022, <strong>six people are dead</strong> and <strong>584 injured</strong>. Pedestrians bear the worst of it: four dead and 360 hurt. SUVs and cars dominate the cases that injure people on foot (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The city’s rollup shows SUVs and cars involved in most pedestrian injuries, with trucks and buses far behind (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The harm peaks late. Injuries spike from 4 p.m. through 8 p.m., with deaths recorded at 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 8 p.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data hourly distribution</a>).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-turns-deadly>Where the street turns deadly</h3><ul><li><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Eastern Parkway</a>: three deaths, 221 injuries.</li><li><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Nostrand Avenue</a>: one death, 68 injuries.</li></ul><p>One crash on Crown and Nostrand killed a 56‑year‑old driver in 2023 after a multi‑vehicle collision pinned him; the record marks “killed” and “trapped” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4612732</a>). On Montgomery at Brooklyn Avenue in April 2025, a 101‑year‑old woman was hit while crossing with the signal. Police cited failure to yield and driver distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4804451</a>).</p><p>Since 2022, the dataset tags “unsafe speed” among the fatal cases on Eastern Parkway, and “driver inattention/distraction” in others. “Failure to yield” appears in the death at Montgomery Street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-slope-is-getting-steeper>The slope is getting steeper</h3><p>This year to date, crashes in this district are up about 19% over last year’s pace. Injuries are up about 23%. Two people are dead so far; none at this point last year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data period stats</a>). Under 18s are among them. A 75‑plus death is logged too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data period stats</a>).</p><p>The pattern in pedestrian harm points mostly to sedans and SUVs. The rollup logs 156 pedestrian injury events with sedans and 100 with SUVs, with three pedestrian deaths tied to SUVs in this span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data person rollup</a>).</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-bleeding-on-these-corners>What would stop the bleeding on these corners</h3><ul><li>Daylight the crossings. Keep cars 20 feet back at crosswalks. Council Member Rita Joseph co‑sponsors a bill to ban parking at corners and require barriers at scale (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138‑2024</a>).</li><li>Harden left turns where people keep getting hit. Montgomery at Brooklyn Avenue. Eastern Parkway’s side streets. Failure to yield shows up in the fatal record there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4804451</a>).</li><li>Target the evening hours.

The city can use it.</h3><p>Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower residential limits to 20 mph. A pedestrian hit at 30 mph dies far more often than at 20. The call is simple: set 20 mph and enforce it (<a href=../../take_action/>CrashCount: Take Action</a>).</p><p>In Albany, there is another lever aimed at chronic speeders. The Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045) would require intelligent speed assistance after a pattern of violations. It moved through committee in June. Senator Zellnor Myrie is listed as a co‑sponsor; he missed two committee votes that week, marked “excused” (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a>).</p><p>Gothamist’s recent roundup showed, again, what happens when speed and mass meet the human body. “Police are investigating three separate car crashes that left two people dead,” the outlet reported. In another case, “Criminal charges for him were still pending” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=names-become-numbers-when-corners-stay-the-same>Names become numbers when corners stay the same</h3><p>This board’s map shows where the bodies fell. Eastern Parkway. Nostrand. Crown. Montgomery. The records note “apparent death.” The hour stamps pile up at dusk. The pattern does not move on its own.</p><p>Lower the speed. Cut the angles. Clear the sightlines. Hold repeat speeders to the line. <strong>Do it now.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Act here</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets and bridges, protected or not. Data goes public. Riders’ movement, danger, and safety projects laid bare. No more hiding the facts.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0745-2024, now enacted, came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced April 11, 2024, and passed on August 15, 2024. The law orders the Department of Transportation to post current bicycle and micromobility ridership data online, updated monthly or at least yearly. The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Restler, Hudson, Schulman, and others. The law demands transparency on where riders travel and what DOT does to keep them safe. This opens the books on bike movement and exposes gaps in protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
