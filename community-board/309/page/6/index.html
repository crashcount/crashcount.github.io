It leads this district in harm, with three deaths and 221 injuries since 2022, more than any other corridor here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). A 53‑year‑old man died at the intersection in 2022. Police cited driver distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4517159</a>). A 56‑year‑old man was killed that fall near Schenectady. Police listed unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4575837</a>). This June, an 8‑year‑old boy died at Albany Avenue. An SUV going straight hit him in the crosswalk at the intersection. The dataset records “apparent death” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4823788</a>).</p><p>Across Brooklyn CB9 since 2022, <strong>six people are dead</strong> and <strong>584 injured</strong>. Pedestrians bear the worst of it: four dead and 360 hurt. SUVs and cars dominate the cases that injure people on foot (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The city’s rollup shows SUVs and cars involved in most pedestrian injuries, with trucks and buses far behind (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The harm peaks late. Injuries spike from 4 p.m. through 8 p.m., with deaths recorded at 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 8 p.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data hourly distribution</a>).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-turns-deadly>Where the street turns deadly</h3><ul><li><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Eastern Parkway</a>: three deaths, 221 injuries.</li><li><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Nostrand Avenue</a>: one death, 68 injuries.</li></ul><p>One crash on Crown and Nostrand killed a 56‑year‑old driver in 2023 after a multi‑vehicle collision pinned him; the record marks “killed” and “trapped” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4612732</a>). On Montgomery at Brooklyn Avenue in April 2025, a 101‑year‑old woman was hit while crossing with the signal. Police cited failure to yield and driver distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4804451</a>).</p><p>Since 2022, the dataset tags “unsafe speed” among the fatal cases on Eastern Parkway, and “driver inattention/distraction” in others. “Failure to yield” appears in the death at Montgomery Street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-slope-is-getting-steeper>The slope is getting steeper</h3><p>This year to date, crashes in this district are up about 19% over last year’s pace. Injuries are up about 23%. Two people are dead so far; none at this point last year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data period stats</a>). Under 18s are among them. A 75‑plus death is logged too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data period stats</a>).</p><p>The pattern in pedestrian harm points mostly to sedans and SUVs. The rollup logs 156 pedestrian injury events with sedans and 100 with SUVs, with three pedestrian deaths tied to SUVs in this span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data person rollup</a>).</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-bleeding-on-these-corners>What would stop the bleeding on these corners</h3><ul><li>Daylight the crossings. Keep cars 20 feet back at crosswalks. Council Member Rita Joseph co‑sponsors a bill to ban parking at corners and require barriers at scale (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138‑2024</a>).</li><li>Harden left turns where people keep getting hit. Montgomery at Brooklyn Avenue. Eastern Parkway’s side streets. Failure to yield shows up in the fatal record there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4804451</a>).</li><li>Target the evening hours.

The city can use it.</h3><p>Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower residential limits to 20 mph. A pedestrian hit at 30 mph dies far more often than at 20. The call is simple: set 20 mph and enforce it (<a href=../../take_action/>CrashCount: Take Action</a>).</p><p>In Albany, there is another lever aimed at chronic speeders. The Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045) would require intelligent speed assistance after a pattern of violations. It moved through committee in June. Senator Zellnor Myrie is listed as a co‑sponsor; he missed two committee votes that week, marked “excused” (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a>).</p><p>Gothamist’s recent roundup showed, again, what happens when speed and mass meet the human body. “Police are investigating three separate car crashes that left two people dead,” the outlet reported. In another case, “Criminal charges for him were still pending” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=names-become-numbers-when-corners-stay-the-same>Names become numbers when corners stay the same</h3><p>This board’s map shows where the bodies fell. Eastern Parkway. Nostrand. Crown. Montgomery. The records note “apparent death.” The hour stamps pile up at dusk. The pattern does not move on its own.</p><p>Lower the speed. Cut the angles. Clear the sightlines. Hold repeat speeders to the line. <strong>Do it now.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Act here</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, featured Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Whitney Tilson. Stringer pledged to move the city away from car dependence and build infrastructure for biking and transit. Myrie called for removing parking mandates to boost housing and speed up buses. Ramos supported repurposing parking for safer streets and green space. Lander pushed for eliminating parking minimums citywide and dynamic curbside management. Mamdani criticized the vast space given to cars. Only Tilson promised to preserve free street parking. The candidates’ stances show a clear divide: most want to reclaim streets for people, not vehicles.

The debate showed urgency but left vulnerable road users waiting for real change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The question was sharp. Congestion pricing cuts traffic. What comes after? Candidates must answer. Streets stay deadly. Pedestrians and cyclists wait for action. The city’s future hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2025, Streetsblog NYC launched a mayoral policy debate, pressing candidates on congestion pricing. The event was not a council bill, but a public challenge. Streetsblog asked: 'Now that congestion pricing is operating in New York City, what should the city government do to build on its success in reducing Manhattan traffic?' Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Whitney Tilson responded, each supporting congestion pricing and further transit investment. Streetsblog’s demand was clear—protect vulnerable road users. The safety analyst notes that congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and opens the door for street redesigns that put vulnerable users first. The debate underscores urgency: congestion pricing helps, but more must be done to make streets safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The car never slowed.</p><p class=mb3>According to the NY Daily News (April 16, 2025), Miriam Yarimi drove her Audi A3 at 68 mph—almost triple the speed limit—through a red light on Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn, striking Natasha Saada and her three young children in a crosswalk. Prosecutors said Yarimi never braked before impact. Saada and her daughters, ages 5 and 8, died; her 4-year-old son remains in critical condition. Yarimi's license was suspended at the time. Her car had accrued nearly $11,000 in violations, including 21 speed camera and five red light tickets. Brooklyn D.A. Eric Gonzalez called it “one of the worst collisions I’ve ever seen on a New York City street.” Yarimi faces manslaughter and related charges. The case highlights repeated driver violations and systemic enforcement failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
