The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most damage.</strong> In three years, they killed two pedestrians and left ten with serious injuries. Trucks and buses caused three serious injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the toll. No one is spared. Children, elders, workers, neighbors—each one a story cut short or changed forever.</p><p>The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry pain that does not heal. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders and red-light runners, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. In the last year, no new redesigns or safety measures were announced for these blocks. The driver who killed Taibel Brod was charged, but the street did not change.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not just cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another tragedy.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The case, reviewed internally by Assistant Trial Commissioner Josh Kleiman, ended with Kovalik cleared of wrongdoing. The Civilian Complaint Review Board had found Kovalik abused his authority, but Kleiman ruled, 'The evidence fails to support either of the specifications with which Respondent is charged.' NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell signed off on the decision. Senator Myrie, who testified about being shoved and threatened, condemned the ruling: 'This ruling is EXACTLY why New Yorkers have zero faith in the system.' Myrie and then-Assembly Member Diana Richardson, both detained at the protest, have filed a federal lawsuit.

The bill, titled “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of bollards at reconstructed sidewalks, curb extensions and pedestrian ramps,” was sponsored by Council Members Brooks-Powers, Krishnan (primary), Stevens, Hanif, Hudson, Richardson Jordan, Riley, and the Manhattan Borough President. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install bollards at reconstructed sidewalks, curb extensions, and pedestrian ramps, especially where accessibility upgrades are made. It mandates a study on bollard effectiveness in high pedestrian areas and demands annual reporting on installations and requests. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no enactment. The measure aims to harden pedestrian space, forcing the city to act where cars threaten walkers and wheelchair users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams promised 300 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of bus lanes by 2025. In 2022, his administration delivered 25 miles of protected bike lanes and 11.95 miles of new or camera-protected bus lanes—far short of annual goals. The city upgraded 1,400 intersections, expanded speed and red-light cameras, and opened 46 new open streets, including Paseo Park. Adams pledged $904 million for the Streets Master Plan but missed year-one requirements. Council Member Rita Joseph praised plans for a Flatbush Avenue bus lane, while advocates like Elizabeth Adams called the lack of progress 'a troubling sign.' Enforcement against reckless drivers and placard abuse remained weak. Citi Bike expansion stalled in some neighborhoods.

The fight is not over.</p><p class=mb3>On December 28, 2022, Councilmember Rita Joseph (District 40), along with Shahana Hanif and Crystal Hudson, urged NYC Parks to allow e-bikes in Prospect Park. The matter, titled 'E-Bikes Are Not Allowed in Prospect Park, But These BK Pols Think They Should Be,' centers on a letter sent December 20 to the Parks Commissioner. The council members wrote, 'The parks department has no justification for classifying e-bikes in the same category as SUVs or trucks.' They condemned the blanket ban, arguing it blocks access for delivery workers and families. Joseph and her colleagues oppose the current ban and the classification of e-bikes as motor vehicles. Their action highlights the need for policies that protect and include vulnerable road users, not punish them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The councilmembers wrote, 'E-bike users include delivery workers who keep us fed, families on cargo bikes, individuals recovering from surgery, older adults, people who live in areas with fewer public transit options, those who want to limit their carbon footprint by not driving cars, and so many more.' They argue the ban unfairly targets vulnerable riders and blocks access for those who rely on e-bikes for work and daily life. The Parks Department’s stance forces e-bike users onto more dangerous streets, undermining safety and equity.

The bill aimed to require the NYPD to post a map of all crossing guard locations on its website. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to reporting on crossing guard deployment.' Council Member Kamillah Hanks led as primary sponsor, joined by Stevens, Louis, Joseph, Farías, Restler, Hudson, Ung, Avilés, and the Bronx Borough President. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. If passed, it would have shed light on where the city protects its most vulnerable at the curb. Instead, the public remains in the dark about guard coverage at dangerous crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
