Twenty-nine left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Brooklyn CB9 since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. In the last twelve months alone, two people were killed and nine suffered serious injuries. One was a child. One was over 100 years old. The streets do not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Just last month, an 8-year-old boy was killed by an SUV on Eastern Parkway.</strong> A 101-year-old woman died crossing with the signal on Montgomery Street. The driver was unlicensed. The car was new. The law did not stop him. The street did not protect her. The numbers keep coming: 1,854 injuries, 3,187 crashes. Most victims are on foot.</p><h2 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> Three deaths, 291 injuries, and 82 serious injuries came from sedans and SUVs. Trucks and buses added more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own scars. The pattern is clear. The pain is not shared equally. Pedestrians and children pay the highest price.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk. Streets Stay Deadly.</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Rita Joseph co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines for people on foot. The bill sits in committee. It has not become law. See the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill&rsquo;s status</a>.</p><p>State Senator Zellnor Myrie talks about safer streets. He promises more protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and enforcement. &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>he said after a ride through Brooklyn</a>. But promises do not slow cars. Votes do. Myrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>missed key committee votes</a> on bills to curb repeat speeders and protect school zones.</p><h2 id=the-price-of-delay>The Price of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every delay is a death sentence for someone.</strong> &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said a Brooklyn State Senator after another fatal crash</a>.</p><h2 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Tell them to pass and enforce real street safety laws.</strong> Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list. The blood is already on the street.

State Senator Zellnor Myrie, representing District 20, called for a dedicated busway on Brooklyn's Flatbush Avenue, echoing the success of Manhattan's 14th Street. The forum, hosted by Riders Alliance, saw candidates—including Myrie, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, and Jim Walden—debate urgent transit reforms. The matter: 'improving NYC's slow bus service.' Myrie and others backed more bus lanes, fare-free buses, and expanding Fair Fares for low-income riders. Mamdani vowed not to cave to local opposition. All criticized Mayor Adams for stalled bus projects. The forum exposed deep frustration with city inaction and highlighted the need for bold, street-level changes to protect riders and speed up commutes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Streets Master Plan requires 30 new miles of bus lanes each year. In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles—just 17 percent of the legal mandate. Rodriguez claimed, “We are doing a great job,” citing national comparisons and blaming delays on community board processes and local opposition, especially around the 96th Street project. State Sen. Jessica Ramos, Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, and State Sen. Zellnor Myrie condemned the city’s self-praise and legal failure. The matter title reads: ‘We Are Doing A Great Job’ … Falling Short of Bus Lane Requirement. Several projects are planned for 2025, but completion is uncertain.

Adams’ administration installed only 15.7 miles last fiscal year. State Sen. Jessica Ramos said, 'The current mayor promised 150 miles of bus lanes and hasn't delivered.' Comptroller Brad Lander promised a 'professional, world-class DOT commissioner.' Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani vowed to resist business interests blocking bus projects. Sen.

According to the police report, the collision occurred when the sedan's left front bumper hit the pedestrian's head, causing severe bleeding. The report identifies 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor, explicitly citing the driver's error in not yielding to a pedestrian lawfully crossing. 'View Obstructed/Limited' is also listed as a contributing factor. The police narrative states, 'A Dodge sedan turned left. A 75-year-old woman crossed with the signal. The bumper struck her head. She bled on the street. The car was fine. She was not.' The pedestrian was conscious but suffered a head injury.

A 2023 Ford sedan, driven by a licensed female driver, was making a left turn when it struck an 82-year-old male pedestrian crossing the intersection.

The pedestrian was conscious after the collision. The report also notes 'View Obstructed/Limited' as a contributing factor, which may have affected the driver’s ability to see the pedestrian.

Vulnerable road users watch as parking mandates hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 21, 2024, the City Council debated Mayor Adams’s City of Yes zoning proposal, which aims to boost housing and scrap mandatory parking citywide. The Council may weaken the plan by creating a three-tiered system, risking fewer new homes. Mayoral challengers Zellnor Myrie, Brad Lander, Scott Stringer, Jessica Ramos, and Zohran Mamdani—all Democrats—strongly support the original plan. Myrie urges, 'resist efforts to revise the proposal in any way that would yield fewer homes.' Lander calls for ending exclusionary zoning and prioritizing housing over parking. Stringer calls the plan a 'small step.' Mamdani opposes changes that reduce housing or water down parking elimination. Ramos would vote yes but wants to protect neighborhood character. The Council’s decision will shape the city’s streets, homes, and the future for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
