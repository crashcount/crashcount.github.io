She had the walk signal. An unlicensed driver in a GMC SUV turned left and struck her. She died twelve days later. Her name was Taibel Brod. Her son called it a <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>tragedy</a>. Her grandson said, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/24/us-news/hasidic-family-matriarch-who-fled-russia-after-world-war-ii-fatally-struck-by-unlicensed-driver-in-nyc-independent-till-her-last-day/>&ldquo;She was extremely independent till her last day.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 388 people were injured and 6 suffered serious injuries in Brooklyn CB9. One person died.</strong> Most were walking, biking, or just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most damage.</strong> In three years, they killed two pedestrians and left ten with serious injuries. Trucks and buses caused three serious injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the toll. No one is spared. Children, elders, workers, neighbors—each one a story cut short or changed forever.</p><p>The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry pain that does not heal. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders and red-light runners, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. In the last year, no new redesigns or safety measures were announced for these blocks. The driver who killed Taibel Brod was charged, but the street did not change.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not just cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another tragedy.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city waits for relief.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2025, the MTA unveiled its 2025-2029 capital plan, targeting the notorious Nostrand Junction subway bottleneck in Central Brooklyn. The plan, announced by MTA Construction & Development president Jamie Torres-Springer and supported by State Sen. Zellnor Myrie, promises to 'finally unclog a notoriously slow-rolling segment of the subway.' The project will keep express and local trains on their tracks, cut delays, and boost throughput from 44 to 60 trains per hour. Myrie said, 'I'm proud the MTA Capital Plan includes funding to finally un-cluster Crown Heights so more New Yorkers can get to work and school on time.' According to safety analysts, improving subway service can shift trips from cars to transit, reducing car traffic and risks for pedestrians and cyclists. The work is overdue.

Cars keep two lanes. Buses lose out. Cyclists get nothing. Sidewalks widen, but most space stays with traffic. Critics say safety for walkers and riders is left behind.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the city's announcement of a $550 million redesign for Fifth Avenue. The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lawsuit says tying DOT money to immigration crackdowns endangers safety. Projects stall. Streets grow riskier. Immigrants fear reporting crimes. The federal move puts lives on the line.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, New York Attorney General Letitia James led a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration’s move to tie U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) funding to state cooperation with immigration enforcement. The suit, joined by other state attorneys general, challenges an April 24 announcement by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that would cut off funding to states refusing to enforce federal immigration law or maintain diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The matter summary states, 'DOT’s blatant overreach threatens to divert critical resources away from public safety and undermine projects that keep our communities connected and safe.' James and her colleagues argue this policy forces states to choose between billions in infrastructure funds and supporting immigrant communities. They warn that withholding funds will halt vital safety projects, making streets and transit more dangerous. The attorneys general also note that immigrants may avoid reporting crimes if they fear deportation, further undermining public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He targets e-bike rules and minimum pay for app workers. DoorDash backs him with $1 million. Critics warn of a rollback on worker protections. Delivery riders face the fallout. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, Andrew Cuomo, running for NYC mayor, made a campaign statement targeting 'delivery chaos.' He proposes revising the city’s minimum pay law and making app companies liable for damages caused by delivery riders. His campaign website claims these changes will 'eliminate inappropriate incentives to dangerous use of e-bikes.' DoorDash donated $1 million to a Cuomo-aligned super PAC. Comptroller Brad Lander accused Cuomo of siding with app companies, saying, 'DoorDash is trying to buy Cuomo’s election...so he’ll roll back the law I passed that requires them to pay their workers a living wage.' Other officials, including Scott Stringer and Zellnor Myrie, voiced doubts about Cuomo’s commitment to delivery worker protections. The bill is not in committee; it is a campaign proposal. The safety impact for vulnerable road users remains unclear, but the fight over pay and regulation leaves delivery workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
