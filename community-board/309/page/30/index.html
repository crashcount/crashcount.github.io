Two people are dead so far; none at this point last year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data period stats</a>). Under 18s are among them. A 75‑plus death is logged too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data period stats</a>).</p><p>The pattern in pedestrian harm points mostly to sedans and SUVs. The rollup logs 156 pedestrian injury events with sedans and 100 with SUVs, with three pedestrian deaths tied to SUVs in this span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data person rollup</a>).</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-bleeding-on-these-corners>What would stop the bleeding on these corners</h3><ul><li>Daylight the crossings. Keep cars 20 feet back at crosswalks. Council Member Rita Joseph co‑sponsors a bill to ban parking at corners and require barriers at scale (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138‑2024</a>).</li><li>Harden left turns where people keep getting hit. Montgomery at Brooklyn Avenue. Eastern Parkway’s side streets. Failure to yield shows up in the fatal record there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4804451</a>).</li><li>Target the evening hours. The data shows the worst from late afternoon into night (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data hourly distribution</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=albany-gave-the-city-the-tool-the-city-can-use-it>Albany gave the city the tool. The city can use it.</h3><p>Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower residential limits to 20 mph. A pedestrian hit at 30 mph dies far more often than at 20. The call is simple: set 20 mph and enforce it (<a href=../../take_action/>CrashCount: Take Action</a>).</p><p>In Albany, there is another lever aimed at chronic speeders. The Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045) would require intelligent speed assistance after a pattern of violations. It moved through committee in June. Senator Zellnor Myrie is listed as a co‑sponsor; he missed two committee votes that week, marked “excused” (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a>).</p><p>Gothamist’s recent roundup showed, again, what happens when speed and mass meet the human body. “Police are investigating three separate car crashes that left two people dead,” the outlet reported. In another case, “Criminal charges for him were still pending” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=names-become-numbers-when-corners-stay-the-same>Names become numbers when corners stay the same</h3><p>This board’s map shows where the bodies fell. Eastern Parkway. Nostrand. Crown. Montgomery. The records note “apparent death.” The hour stamps pile up at dusk. The pattern does not move on its own.</p><p>Lower the speed. Cut the angles. Clear the sightlines. Hold repeat speeders to the line. <strong>Do it now.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Act here</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Civilian Complaint Review Board found the officer abused his authority.</p><p class=mb3>On June 30, 2022, State Senator Zellnor Myrie testified at an NYPD disciplinary hearing for Officer Michael Kovalik, a member of the Strategic Response Group. The hearing followed a Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) investigation, which found Kovalik abused his authority by threatening Myrie and others with pepper spray during a protest on May 29, 2020. The matter centered on 'excessive use of force with department-issued bikes' and the officer's actions at a protest outside Barclays Center after George Floyd's murder. Myrie, detained with zip ties, said, 'I felt what felt like bike tires on my back and on my arms.' He described lasting trauma from the incident. The CCRB prosecutor, Andre Applewhite, argued video evidence confirmed the threats. Myrie and another lawmaker have filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD. The case highlights the dangers faced by peaceful protesters and the use of police bicycles as tools of force.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
