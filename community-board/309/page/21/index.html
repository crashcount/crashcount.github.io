She had the walk signal. An unlicensed driver in a GMC SUV turned left and struck her. She died twelve days later. Her name was Taibel Brod. Her son called it a <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>tragedy</a>. Her grandson said, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/24/us-news/hasidic-family-matriarch-who-fled-russia-after-world-war-ii-fatally-struck-by-unlicensed-driver-in-nyc-independent-till-her-last-day/>&ldquo;She was extremely independent till her last day.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 388 people were injured and 6 suffered serious injuries in Brooklyn CB9. One person died.</strong> Most were walking, biking, or just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most damage.</strong> In three years, they killed two pedestrians and left ten with serious injuries. Trucks and buses caused three serious injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the toll. No one is spared. Children, elders, workers, neighbors—each one a story cut short or changed forever.</p><p>The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry pain that does not heal. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders and red-light runners, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. In the last year, no new redesigns or safety measures were announced for these blocks. The driver who killed Taibel Brod was charged, but the street did not change.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not just cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another tragedy.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass...S.315/A.1416, which would authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program,' was sponsored by Council Members Shahana K.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Farah N. Louis (primary) and co-sponsored by Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Shekar Krishnan, Charles Barron, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Lincoln Restler, and Rita C. Joseph, required the Department of Transportation to investigate all serious vehicular crashes. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to investigate vehicle collisions.' The bill would have expanded the definition of serious crashes, set strict investigation timelines, and mandated detailed public reports. It also called for reviews of street design and infrastructure at crash sites, with recommendations for safety improvements.
