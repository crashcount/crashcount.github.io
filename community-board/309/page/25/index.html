She had the walk signal. An unlicensed driver in a GMC SUV turned left and struck her. She died twelve days later. Her name was Taibel Brod. Her son called it a <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>tragedy</a>. Her grandson said, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/24/us-news/hasidic-family-matriarch-who-fled-russia-after-world-war-ii-fatally-struck-by-unlicensed-driver-in-nyc-independent-till-her-last-day/>&ldquo;She was extremely independent till her last day.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 388 people were injured and 6 suffered serious injuries in Brooklyn CB9. One person died.</strong> Most were walking, biking, or just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most damage.</strong> In three years, they killed two pedestrians and left ten with serious injuries. Trucks and buses caused three serious injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the toll. No one is spared. Children, elders, workers, neighbors—each one a story cut short or changed forever.</p><p>The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry pain that does not heal. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders and red-light runners, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. In the last year, no new redesigns or safety measures were announced for these blocks. The driver who killed Taibel Brod was charged, but the street did not change.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not just cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another tragedy.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
