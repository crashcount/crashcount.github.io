Twenty-nine left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Brooklyn CB9 since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. In the last twelve months alone, two people were killed and nine suffered serious injuries. One was a child. One was over 100 years old. The streets do not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Just last month, an 8-year-old boy was killed by an SUV on Eastern Parkway.</strong> A 101-year-old woman died crossing with the signal on Montgomery Street. The driver was unlicensed. The car was new. The law did not stop him. The street did not protect her. The numbers keep coming: 1,854 injuries, 3,187 crashes. Most victims are on foot.</p><h2 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> Three deaths, 291 injuries, and 82 serious injuries came from sedans and SUVs. Trucks and buses added more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own scars. The pattern is clear. The pain is not shared equally. Pedestrians and children pay the highest price.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk. Streets Stay Deadly.</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Rita Joseph co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines for people on foot. The bill sits in committee. It has not become law. See the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill&rsquo;s status</a>.</p><p>State Senator Zellnor Myrie talks about safer streets. He promises more protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and enforcement. &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>he said after a ride through Brooklyn</a>. But promises do not slow cars. Votes do. Myrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>missed key committee votes</a> on bills to curb repeat speeders and protect school zones.</p><h2 id=the-price-of-delay>The Price of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every delay is a death sentence for someone.</strong> &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said a Brooklyn State Senator after another fatal crash</a>.</p><h2 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Tell them to pass and enforce real street safety laws.</strong> Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list. The blood is already on the street.

Cars keep two lanes. Buses lose out. Cyclists get nothing. Sidewalks widen, but most space stays with traffic. Critics say safety for walkers and riders is left behind.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the city's announcement of a $550 million redesign for Fifth Avenue. The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The suit, joined by other state attorneys general, challenges an April 24 announcement by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that would cut off funding to states refusing to enforce federal immigration law or maintain diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The matter summary states, 'DOT’s blatant overreach threatens to divert critical resources away from public safety and undermine projects that keep our communities connected and safe.' James and her colleagues argue this policy forces states to choose between billions in infrastructure funds and supporting immigrant communities. They warn that withholding funds will halt vital safety projects, making streets and transit more dangerous. The attorneys general also note that immigrants may avoid reporting crimes if they fear deportation, further undermining public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, Andrew Cuomo, running for NYC mayor, made a campaign statement targeting 'delivery chaos.' He proposes revising the city’s minimum pay law and making app companies liable for damages caused by delivery riders. His campaign website claims these changes will 'eliminate inappropriate incentives to dangerous use of e-bikes.' DoorDash donated $1 million to a Cuomo-aligned super PAC. Comptroller Brad Lander accused Cuomo of siding with app companies, saying, 'DoorDash is trying to buy Cuomo’s election...so he’ll roll back the law I passed that requires them to pay their workers a living wage.' Other officials, including Scott Stringer and Zellnor Myrie, voiced doubts about Cuomo’s commitment to delivery worker protections. The bill is not in committee; it is a campaign proposal. The safety impact for vulnerable road users remains unclear, but the fight over pay and regulation leaves delivery workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Zohran Mamdani all support expanding open streets and outdoor dining. Stringer pledges to 'loosen unnecessary design requirements' and simplify permits. Myrie promises a 'year-round outdoor dining program' and restoration of open streets, citing safety and access for pedestrians and cyclists. Ramos calls the current scheme 'unworkable' and urges consensus. Lander faults City Hall for 'over-regulating' and vows to speed up applications while 'respecting pedestrian traffic.' Mamdani highlights the economic and social benefits. All criticize current restrictions and bureaucratic hurdles. The candidates frame these programs as essential for small businesses, public space, and safer streets, but no formal safety analysis is attached.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, featured Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Whitney Tilson. Stringer demanded 'massive expansion of protected bike lanes.' Myrie backed S1047, a bill for 50-percent e-bike rebates. Ramos called for safe bike lanes and clear signage for all riders. Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes. All agreed: safer streets need better design, strong enforcement, and real protections for workers and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
