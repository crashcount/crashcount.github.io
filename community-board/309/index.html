She had the walk signal. An unlicensed driver in a GMC SUV turned left and struck her. She died twelve days later. Her name was Taibel Brod. Her son called it a <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>tragedy</a>. Her grandson said, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/24/us-news/hasidic-family-matriarch-who-fled-russia-after-world-war-ii-fatally-struck-by-unlicensed-driver-in-nyc-independent-till-her-last-day/>&ldquo;She was extremely independent till her last day.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 388 people were injured and 6 suffered serious injuries in Brooklyn CB9. One person died.</strong> Most were walking, biking, or just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most damage.</strong> In three years, they killed two pedestrians and left ten with serious injuries. Trucks and buses caused three serious injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the toll. No one is spared. Children, elders, workers, neighbors—each one a story cut short or changed forever.</p><p>The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry pain that does not heal. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders and red-light runners, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. In the last year, no new redesigns or safety measures were announced for these blocks. The driver who killed Taibel Brod was charged, but the street did not change.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not just cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another tragedy.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program.

He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%. The case highlights ongoing tension between local political power, city notification procedures, and efforts to protect cyclists and pedestrians through street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He saw blocked lanes, heavy traffic, and real risk. Myrie called out the dangers for new cyclists. He backed safer bike lanes and fewer cars. The ride changed nothing systemic.</p><p class=mb3>On June 16, 2025, State Senator Zellnor Myrie joined reporter Dave Colon for a bike ride through Brooklyn, as covered by Streetsblog NYC. The event was not a formal bill or committee action, but a public statement on street safety. Myrie said, "We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible." He highlighted blocked bike lanes, rising injuries, and the lack of protected infrastructure. Myrie voiced support for congestion pricing, safer streets, and reducing car dependency. The safety impact is neutral: a senator riding a bike is symbolic and does not directly change safety outcomes for pedestrians or cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact sent the SUV into a southbound NYPD cruiser. The article notes, 'An SUV slammed into an NYPD cruiser in a three-car smash-up in Brooklyn early Sunday.' Two police officers and two SUV passengers were hospitalized in stable condition. One person was taken into custody, though no charges were filed at the time of reporting. The crash, which occurred at 2:11 am, highlights the dangers at busy intersections and the violent force unleashed when vehicles collide.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles.

The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This comes as Tisch’s department intensifies enforcement against cyclists. Streetsblog NYC reported, 'Both Brad Lander and Zellnor Myrie, mayoral candidates, have reiterated their pledge to retain NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch if elected, despite concerns over her crackdown on cyclists.' Lander’s spokesperson, Kat Capossela, said Lander trusts Tisch to implement his policies, including cracking down on reckless drivers, even as Tisch currently targets cyclists. Myrie’s campaign promised to keep streets safe without unnecessary enforcement. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and former Comptroller Scott Stringer also weighed in, but stopped short of firm commitments. A safety analyst notes: Retaining a commissioner known for crackdowns on cyclists likely perpetuates enforcement-focused approaches that burden vulnerable road users, discouraging cycling and undermining mode shift and street equity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
