She did not make it to the other side. <strong>A 3-year-old girl was killed by an SUV making a left turn at Lenox and 135th.</strong> Her mother was hurt beside her. The street was busy. The driver kept going east. The girl’s name is not in the data.

The numbers do not heal. They do not bring back the child.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-broken-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Broken Promises</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the harm.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they left families with empty beds. In three years, 5 people died. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the blows.</strong></p><p>A cyclist was killed by a bus at Lenox and 138th. A pedestrian was crushed by a turning sedan. A moped rider lost an arm. The stories repeat. The city counts the bodies. The streets do not change fast enough.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-done--and-not-done>What Leaders Have Done — and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Some leaders have moved. Some have not.</strong> State Senator Cordell Cleare voted yes to curb repeat speeders, backing a bill to force speed limiters on the worst offenders. She also voted to extend school speed zones. State Senator Cleare <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes in committee, boosting street safety by curbing repeat speeders</a>.</p><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam sponsored a bill to pilot high-visibility pavement markings at deadly corners.

The streets are not safe. <strong>Every week, another crash. Another family left to grieve.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action for the dead and the living. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s name to be lost in the data.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

The matter title reads: 'establishing a high visibility pavement marking pilot program.' Council Member Yusef Salaam leads, joined by Menin, De La Rosa, Brooks-Powers, Cabán, Brannan, and Hanif.
