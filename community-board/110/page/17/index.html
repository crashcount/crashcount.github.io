Thirty-five left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last three and a half years, Manhattan CB10 has seen 3,022 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is sharper. Two of the dead were children or elders. One was a three-year-old girl, crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. She never made it to the other side. Her mother was hurt too. The SUV kept turning, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 59-year-old man on a bike was crushed by a bus on Lenox. A 45-year-old cyclist, Devon Hughley, was killed by a driver fleeing police. His sister said the arrest brought &ldquo;some peace&rdquo;—but the posters with his face still hang in the hallway, as reported by <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/06/harlem-hit-and-run-nypd-car-stop-stolen-van-bicyclist-devon-hughley-arrest-enesin-delarosa/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p><strong>Most of the injured are young.</strong> In the last year, 32 children were hurt. One died. The streets are not safe for them. Or for anyone.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can act. The Mayor can act. They have not. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives, but their future is always in doubt. Each delay is another family left to grieve.</p><p>No local leader has stood in front of the cameras here to say, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No new law has made these corners safer. The silence is heavy. The danger is heavier.</p><h3 id=what-comes-nextand-who-will-demand-it>What Comes Next—And Who Will Demand It</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power to leave things as they are. Every delay is a decision. The dead do not get to vote. The living do.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where a child can cross and come home.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another poster in the hallway. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
