A mother’s hand, empty. In the last twelve months, two people died on the streets of Manhattan CB10. Nine more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In all, 426 people were hurt in 831 crashes—each one a story cut short, a body broken, a family changed forever.</p><p>A three-year-old girl was killed crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. Her mother was hit too. The SUV kept turning. The numbers do not soften: children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians pay the price, as shown by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=local-leaders-words-laws-and-waiting>Local Leaders: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city has tools. It does not always use them. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council could act now. They have not. Speed cameras, proven to save lives, face renewal fights in Albany. Each delay is measured in blood.</p><p>After Devon Hughley was killed by a fleeing driver, his sister said the arrest brought &ldquo;some peace,&rdquo; as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/06/harlem-hit-and-run-nypd-car-stop-stolen-van-bicyclist-devon-hughley-arrest-enesin-delarosa/>NY Daily News</a>. But peace is not safety. Memorial posters fade. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-who-waits>The Pattern: Who Pays, Who Waits</h3><p>SUVs, sedans, and trucks cause most of the harm. In three years, cars and trucks killed one person and seriously injured five more. Motorcycles and mopeds left four with moderate injuries. Bikes caused six moderate injuries. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone moving under their own power.</p><p>Each crash is called an accident. But the pattern is clear. Speed, size, and inaction kill.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.

The report states, 'A 59-year-old man on an e-bike was struck by a northbound bus. His head was crushed. He died there, unconscious, in the dark, as the city slept around him.' The bus and e-bike were both reported as going straight ahead before the crash. The police report lists contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' No driver errors are specified in the data, but the fatal impact between the bus and the vulnerable cyclist resulted in a deadly head injury. The e-bike rider was not using any safety equipment, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the absence of specified driver errors. The crash took place just after midnight, underscoring the ongoing danger faced by cyclists on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The vehicle struck a 35-year-old male pedestrian who was crossing the street without a signal or crosswalk. The point of impact was the taxi’s right front bumper. The pedestrian sustained contusions and bruising over his entire body but remained conscious. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor to the crash. Additionally, the pedestrian’s crossing without a signal was noted as a secondary factor but does not mitigate the driver’s responsibility. The taxi showed no vehicle damage, indicating a low-speed impact.
