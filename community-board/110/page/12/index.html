The light was with them. An SUV turned left. The girl died in the street. Her mother was scraped and bruised but lived. This was July 11, 2024. The driver kept his license. The city kept its silence.</p><p>In the last twelve months, two people died and ten more suffered serious injuries on the streets of Manhattan CB10. Three hundred ninety-nine were hurt. The numbers pile up, but the pain is sharp. A cyclist crushed by a bus on Lenox and 138th. A man on a motorcycle, helmet on, ejected and killed at 116th and 8th. A pedestrian struck crossing with the signal. The city calls them accidents. They are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers pay first. In the last year, a child died. An elder was left with broken bones. Cyclists and pedestrians are hit again and again. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—one death, 192 minor injuries, 86 moderate, 6 serious. Trucks and buses left 31 more hurt. Bikes and mopeds added to the toll, but the weight of steel does the killing.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-done-what-has-been-delayed>What Has Been Done? What Has Been Delayed?</h2><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the desperate and the poor. He co-sponsored bills for more protected bike lanes, speed humps, and crash investigations. He voted yes on a law letting pedestrians cross anywhere, stripping away a tool used to blame the dead. But the city still moves slow. &ldquo;It required some extrication, meaning they had to use some equipment to free the patient,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a> after a bus crash. The tools come out after the blood is on the street.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-demand-action>The Next Step: Demand Action</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, not paint. Demand action before another child dies. The city will not move unless you push.</p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
