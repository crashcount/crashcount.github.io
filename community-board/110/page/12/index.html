The light was with them. An SUV turned left. The girl died in the street. Her mother was scraped and bruised but lived. This was July 11, 2024. The driver kept his license. The city kept its silence.</p><p>In the last twelve months, two people died and ten more suffered serious injuries on the streets of Manhattan CB10. Three hundred ninety-nine were hurt. The numbers pile up, but the pain is sharp. A cyclist crushed by a bus on Lenox and 138th. A man on a motorcycle, helmet on, ejected and killed at 116th and 8th. A pedestrian struck crossing with the signal. The city calls them accidents. They are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers pay first. In the last year, a child died. An elder was left with broken bones. Cyclists and pedestrians are hit again and again. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—one death, 192 minor injuries, 86 moderate, 6 serious. Trucks and buses left 31 more hurt. Bikes and mopeds added to the toll, but the weight of steel does the killing.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-done-what-has-been-delayed>What Has Been Done? What Has Been Delayed?</h2><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the desperate and the poor. He co-sponsored bills for more protected bike lanes, speed humps, and crash investigations. He voted yes on a law letting pedestrians cross anywhere, stripping away a tool used to blame the dead. But the city still moves slow. &ldquo;It required some extrication, meaning they had to use some equipment to free the patient,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a> after a bus crash. The tools come out after the blood is on the street.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-demand-action>The Next Step: Demand Action</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, not paint. Demand action before another child dies. The city will not move unless you push.</p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the sedan driver was 'distracted' and failed to maintain lane position, citing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The cyclist was ejected from his bike, landing head-first and suffering severe bleeding, with injuries focused on the head. The police report describes the aftermath: 'He flew, landed head-first. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He lay conscious, bleeding.' The bike was left twisted on the street. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is listed after the primary driver errors. The collision highlights the lethal consequences when drivers fail to pay attention and maintain proper lane discipline.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users.

Morning breaks over a silent road.</p><p class=mb3>A 42-year-old motorcyclist was killed in a violent crash on Harlem River Drive, according to the police report. The incident occurred early in the morning when the motorcycle, traveling south, lost control on slippery pavement and collided head-on with a southbound SUV. The police report lists 'Pavement Slippery' as a contributing factor. The rider, who was helmeted, was ejected from the motorcycle and suffered severe head trauma, resulting in apparent death at the scene. The motorcycle was described as 'demolished,' and blood was visible on the road. Both vehicles sustained front-end damage. No driver errors such as speeding or failure to yield are cited in the report, but the hazardous road surface is explicitly noted. The victim's helmet use is mentioned in the police report after the primary contributing factor of the slick pavement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
