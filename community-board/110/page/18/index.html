She did not make it to the other side. <strong>A 3-year-old girl was killed by an SUV making a left turn at Lenox and 135th.</strong> Her mother was hurt beside her. The street was busy. The driver kept going east. The girl’s name is not in the data.

A moped rider lost an arm. The stories repeat. The city counts the bodies. The streets do not change fast enough.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-done--and-not-done>What Leaders Have Done — and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Some leaders have moved. Some have not.</strong> State Senator Cordell Cleare voted yes to curb repeat speeders, backing a bill to force speed limiters on the worst offenders. She also voted to extend school speed zones. State Senator Cleare <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes in committee, boosting street safety by curbing repeat speeders</a>.</p><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam sponsored a bill to pilot high-visibility pavement markings at deadly corners.

The streets are not safe. <strong>Every week, another crash. Another family left to grieve.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings.
