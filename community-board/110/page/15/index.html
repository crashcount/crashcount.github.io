She did not make it to the other side. <strong>A 3-year-old girl was killed by an SUV making a left turn at Lenox and 135th.</strong> Her mother was hurt beside her. The street was busy. The driver kept going east. The girl’s name is not in the data.

The numbers do not heal. They do not bring back the child.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-broken-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Broken Promises</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the harm.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they left families with empty beds. In three years, 5 people died. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the blows.</strong></p><p>A cyclist was killed by a bus at Lenox and 138th. A pedestrian was crushed by a turning sedan. A moped rider lost an arm. The stories repeat. The city counts the bodies. The streets do not change fast enough.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-done--and-not-done>What Leaders Have Done — and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Some leaders have moved. Some have not.</strong> State Senator Cordell Cleare voted yes to curb repeat speeders, backing a bill to force speed limiters on the worst offenders. She also voted to extend school speed zones. State Senator Cleare <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes in committee, boosting street safety by curbing repeat speeders</a>.</p><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam sponsored a bill to pilot high-visibility pavement markings at deadly corners.

The streets are not safe. <strong>Every week, another crash. Another family left to grieve.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action for the dead and the living. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s name to be lost in the data.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Its bumper struck a man crossing with the signal. Bones broke. He stayed conscious. The street bore the wound. The driver failed to yield. The city’s danger showed its teeth.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 2023 Honda sedan turned right at the corner of West 144th Street and 7th Avenue in Manhattan. The vehicle's center front bumper struck a 33-year-old man who was crossing the intersection with the signal. The impact crushed the pedestrian’s hip and upper leg, leaving him injured but conscious. The report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor for the crash. The pedestrian’s action—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the driver’s failure to yield. The sedan sustained no damage, but the man suffered severe crush injuries. The incident underscores the persistent danger faced by those on foot when drivers disregard the right-of-way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
