She did not make it to the other side. <strong>A 3-year-old girl was killed by an SUV making a left turn at Lenox and 135th.</strong> Her mother was hurt beside her. The street was busy. The driver kept going east. The girl’s name is not in the data. The loss is written in numbers: one dead, one injured. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In the past year, <strong>Manhattan CB10 saw 1 death and 11 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are hit again and again.</strong> In the last 12 months, 449 people were hurt. The numbers do not heal. They do not bring back the child.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-broken-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Broken Promises</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the harm.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they left families with empty beds. In three years, 5 people died. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the blows.</strong></p><p>A cyclist was killed by a bus at Lenox and 138th. A pedestrian was crushed by a turning sedan. A moped rider lost an arm. The stories repeat. The city counts the bodies. The streets do not change fast enough.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-done--and-not-done>What Leaders Have Done — and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Some leaders have moved. Some have not.</strong> State Senator Cordell Cleare voted yes to curb repeat speeders, backing a bill to force speed limiters on the worst offenders. She also voted to extend school speed zones. State Senator Cleare <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes in committee, boosting street safety by curbing repeat speeders</a>.</p><p>Council Member Yusef Salaam sponsored a bill to pilot high-visibility pavement markings at deadly corners.

The streets are not safe. <strong>Every week, another crash. Another family left to grieve.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action for the dead and the living. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s name to be lost in the data.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
