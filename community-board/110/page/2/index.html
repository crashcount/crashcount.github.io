Thirty-five left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last three and a half years, Manhattan CB10 has seen 3,022 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is sharper. Two of the dead were children or elders. One was a three-year-old girl, crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. She never made it to the other side. Her mother was hurt too. The SUV kept turning, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 59-year-old man on a bike was crushed by a bus on Lenox. A 45-year-old cyclist, Devon Hughley, was killed by a driver fleeing police. His sister said the arrest brought &ldquo;some peace&rdquo;—but the posters with his face still hang in the hallway, as reported by <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/06/harlem-hit-and-run-nypd-car-stop-stolen-van-bicyclist-devon-hughley-arrest-enesin-delarosa/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p><strong>Most of the injured are young.</strong> In the last year, 32 children were hurt. One died. The streets are not safe for them. Or for anyone.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can act. The Mayor can act. They have not. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives, but their future is always in doubt. Each delay is another family left to grieve.</p><p>No local leader has stood in front of the cameras here to say, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No new law has made these corners safer. The silence is heavy. The danger is heavier.</p><h3 id=what-comes-nextand-who-will-demand-it>What Comes Next—And Who Will Demand It</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power to leave things as they are. Every delay is a decision. The dead do not get to vote. The living do.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where a child can cross and come home.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another poster in the hallway. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure handled the matter. The bill’s title: 'A Local Law in relation to studying alternative public transit fare systems.' Council Members Oswald Feliz (primary sponsor), Chris Banks, and Yusef Salaam backed the proposal. The bill was withdrawn on May 1, 2025, before any vote or further action. No safety analyst reviewed its impact on vulnerable road users. The withdrawal leaves the city’s fare structure unchanged, with no new study or reforms on the table.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The dead remain silent.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on April 27, 2025, that Francisco Andres Guzman Parra, 31, died after crashing a stolen vehicle on Dyckman Street in Manhattan following an NYPD pursuit. The article states, "NYPD sources said the two officers in pursuit returned to their stationhouse without reporting the crash." The FDNY later found Guzman Parra dead in the burning car. Patrick Hendry of the Police Benevolent Association claimed officers "lost sight of the car and did not know it crashed," but the family's attorney, Jeremy Feigenbaum, said their investigation "has not corroborated the officers' claim." The officers remain on leave as both the NYPD and the New York attorney general's office investigate. The case raises questions about police pursuit protocols and reporting failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets remain dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0854-2025, now laid over in the Committee on Public Safety, urges the state to pass S.7621/A.7979. The resolution, introduced April 24, 2025, calls for 'requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits.' Council Member Lincoln Restler leads, joined by Salaam, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Banks, and Brannan. The bill would force drivers with eleven or more points in eighteen months, or six speed/red light camera tickets in a year, to install speed-limiting tech. The Council cites data: 265 killed, 52,949 injured on city streets in 2023. The measure aims to put a brake on reckless driving. The committee has not yet advanced the resolution. Vulnerable road users wait for action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
