A mother’s hand, empty. In the last twelve months, two people died on the streets of Manhattan CB10. Nine more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In all, 426 people were hurt in 831 crashes—each one a story cut short, a body broken, a family changed forever.</p><p>A three-year-old girl was killed crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. Her mother was hit too. The SUV kept turning. The numbers do not soften: children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians pay the price, as shown by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=local-leaders-words-laws-and-waiting>Local Leaders: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city has tools. It does not always use them. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council could act now. They have not. Speed cameras, proven to save lives, face renewal fights in Albany. Each delay is measured in blood.</p><p>After Devon Hughley was killed by a fleeing driver, his sister said the arrest brought &ldquo;some peace,&rdquo; as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/06/harlem-hit-and-run-nypd-car-stop-stolen-van-bicyclist-devon-hughley-arrest-enesin-delarosa/>NY Daily News</a>. But peace is not safety. Memorial posters fade. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-who-waits>The Pattern: Who Pays, Who Waits</h3><p>SUVs, sedans, and trucks cause most of the harm. In three years, cars and trucks killed one person and seriously injured five more. Motorcycles and mopeds left four with moderate injuries. Bikes caused six moderate injuries. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone moving under their own power.</p><p>Each crash is called an accident. But the pattern is clear. Speed, size, and inaction kill.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The time for action is now.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action today.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
