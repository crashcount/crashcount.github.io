Fourteen more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch: 1,240 injured, 2,569 crashes. Each figure is a body broken or a life ended. Most are not behind the wheel.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—two deaths, 169 injuries. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles left their own mark. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h2 id=recent-blood-on-the-asphalt>Recent Blood on the Asphalt</h2><p>Just this May, a 73-year-old man was killed crossing at West 135th. The SUV kept going.
