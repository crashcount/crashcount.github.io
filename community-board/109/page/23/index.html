Fourteen left with serious injuries. In the last three and a half years, Manhattan CB9 has seen 2,470 crashes. The numbers are blunt. Behind them are bodies—pedestrians, cyclists, children. A 73-year-old man, crossing at 135th Street, struck by an SUV and left semiconscious, bleeding from the head. A cyclist, ejected and killed by an SUV at St. Nicholas and 155th. These are not accidents. They are the price of inaction.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>The carnage does not slow. In the past twelve months alone, 342 people have been injured in crashes here. One person died. Serious injuries are up 50% from the year before. The wounds are not abstract. They are broken bones, blood on the street, a child in the back seat of a car struck by a runaway food cart loaded with propane tanks. &ldquo;Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>reported the NY Daily News</a>. The woman and child inside survived. This time.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h2><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Senator Cordell Cleare <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to curb repeat speeders</a> with speed-limiting tech, a step toward fewer deaths. Council Member Shaun Abreu has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks</a> and called out unsafe detours that force cyclists into danger. But the streets remain deadly. The policies come slow. The bodies pile up faster.</p><h2 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h2><p>Every crash is preventable. Every delay is a choice. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and end the reign of repeat offenders. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, more protected crossings, and real enforcement. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
