Since 2022, Manhattan CB9 has seen <strong>nine people killed and 1,267 injured</strong> in 2,627 crashes, with 19 listed as serious injuries, according to city data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Motorcycles, SUVs, sedans. Bikes and bodies. The toll keeps coming in.</p><h3 id=where-the-bodies-fall>Where the bodies fall</h3><p>The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Henry Hudson Parkway</a> is the worst corridor in CB9: two deaths and 199 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Riverside Drive</a> adds another death and 24 injuries. Amsterdam Avenue and 125th and 145th Streets pile up dozens more injuries.</p><p>At 10:52 p.m. on Aug. 3, 2023, a 42‑year‑old motorcyclist died on the Henry Hudson. The record lists ejection, helmet used, and driver factors: “Unsafe Speed” and “Tinted Windows” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4651573</a>).</p><p>At W 155th and St. Nicholas, a bicyclist died at 10:42 p.m. on Nov. 2, 2024. Police logged driver inattention and unsafe speed in a collision with an SUV (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4768346</a>).</p><p>On May 10, 2025, at 11:55 p.m., an SUV struck a 73‑year‑old man at W 135th Street. He was recorded “Semiconscious,” then “Killed.” The database calls it “Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion.” The SUV was “Going Straight Ahead” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4812753</a>).</p><h3 id=the-clock-tells-on-us>The clock tells on us</h3><p>Nights are bad. Injuries climb through the late hours. Between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m., injuries spike, with deaths logged at 10 p.m., 11 p.m., and midnight hours. The 10 p.m. hour shows 82 injuries and two deaths; 11 p.m. has 57 injuries and three serious injuries; midnight holds 76 injuries and a serious injury (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Drivers hit most pedestrians here. SUVs and cars account for the bulk of cases: 172 pedestrian injuries and two pedestrian deaths tied to SUVs and sedans in the rollup. Trucks and buses injure too, but far less often (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=why-the-pain-keeps-coming>Why the pain keeps coming</h3><p>“Unsafe speed” is present in fatal files. “Driver Inattention/Distraction” appears again and again. The board’s contributing factors list speed, inattention, failure to yield, and red‑light disregard across hundreds of injuries, with multiple deaths under “other” and “vulnerable road user error” buckets (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>At Bowery and Canal last month, a stolen car doing more than 100 mph killed two people. The city moved to harden the site. “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” said the transportation commissioner (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>). It should not take two dead to fix a corner. “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” an advocate said, warning most of the corridor “will remain deadly” even after changes (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-the-streets-that-kill>Fix the streets that kill</h3><p>Start where the numbers are worst. Harden turns and narrow lanes on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Henry Hudson</a> access points in CB9. Install raised crossings and daylight corners on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Riverside Drive</a> and along 125th and 145th. Late‑night hotspots need speed control and signal timing that protects people on foot and on bikes. Repeat crash sites need repeat fixes.</p><p>City Hall and Albany have tools and use them when pushed. The Council sent the state a message to let the city set lower limits. “The city&rsquo;s ability to control the speed limits on its streets plays a crucial role in delivering traffic safety,” said the DOT commissioner at the time (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/24/city-council-poised-to-pass-home-rule-message-for-sammys-law-on-thursday>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Albany advanced a bill to stop the worst repeat speeders with speed‑limiting tech. Senator Cleare co‑sponsored and voted yes in committee on <strong>S 4045</strong>, which requires intelligent speed assistance for drivers with repeat violations (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). On the Assembly side, local members signed on to <strong>A 2299</strong> to mandate the same devices for habitual speeders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States</a>).</p><p>Lower speeds save lives. <strong>Pass the devices. Drop the default.</strong> Then go back to the corners where blood has already dried and rebuild them.</p><p>If you want this to stop, <strong>act</strong>. Tell City Hall to set safer speeds and back the bills that rein in repeat speeders. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council grilled DSNY for picking low bids over safety. Victims’ lives lost in the math. Oversight weak. Dangerous firms keep rolling. Streets stay risky for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 4, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on commercial waste zone implementation and contractor selection. The hearing spotlighted the Commercial Waste Zones law, which aims to cut crashes by limiting private trash haulers in each zone. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, author of the 2019 reform, and Council Member Shaun Abreu led the charge, questioning why companies like Cogent Waste Solutions—with poor safety records—were awarded contracts. Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial. Lawmakers condemned the city for putting cost before safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council members question why a company with such a record still hauls trash in city zones. The city’s new waste program promises stricter oversight, but danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2024, the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) appointed an independent monitor for Cogent Waste Solutions, a private carting firm with a deadly safety record. The move comes before the city’s new Commercial Waste Zone program launches this fall. Council Members Shaun Abreu and Sandy Nurse raised alarms, asking, 'how the city awarded a contract to a company with a history of endangering workers to begin with.' Cogent’s trucks have killed one, injured four, and racked up hundreds of violations. Despite this, DSNY allowed Cogent to win contracts in four waste zones. DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.' The oversight hearing exposes a system that lets reckless firms operate, even as new rules loom.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2024, Councilmember Shaun Abreu (District 7) introduced a bill targeting delivery app tipping practices. The bill, now before the City Council, would require apps to let customers tip at checkout and set a minimum gratuity suggestion of 10%. The measure responds to recent app changes that made tipping harder, slashing delivery workers’ earnings. Abreu called it 'the most common sense bill for not only Deliveristas but consumers.' The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection stated it does not endorse the app companies’ decisions and will review the legislation. Abreu is also working on a pay transparency bill. The legislation seeks to restore lost income for delivery workers, who rely on tips to survive.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
