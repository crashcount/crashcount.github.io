A police car, lights flashing, swerves to avoid a taxi and plows into diners at a sidewalk table. The city calls it an investigation. The people call it pain. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 309 were injured</strong> in crashes across Manhattan Community Board 9. Six were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><h2 id=vulnerable-first-always-last>Vulnerable First, Always Last</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In three years, seven people have died. Over 1,100 have been hurt. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons: <strong>1 death, 59 moderate injuries, 2 serious injuries</strong> from these vehicles alone. Bikes, trucks, taxis—they all leave their mark, but the story is the same. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The curb is not safe.</p><p>On May 27, a police cruiser hit two people eating outside. The NYPD spokesperson said, &ldquo;The chaos erupted as the police cruiser, with lights flashing and sirens blaring, was traveling north on Broadway&mldr; when a cab heading south attempted a leisurely left turn onto West 112th Street&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/us-news/nypd-squad-car-strikes-2-people-in-outdoor-dining-area-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-with-taxi-police/>New York Post</a>). Both diners and officers went to the hospital. The taxi driver got a summons for failing to yield. The investigation is ongoing. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders Talk, Streets Wait</h2><p><strong>Local leaders say the right words.</strong> The city claims progress, touting new speed limits and more cameras. But the blood dries slow. &ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>NY Daily News</a>). Cameras and enforcement help, but the danger remains. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Every day of delay is another roll of the dice for someone crossing the street.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected space for people, not cars. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name on the list. The city will not act unless you force their hand.</p><p><strong>The crisis is slow, but it is relentless. Make your voice relentless too.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, not yet a formal bill, launches with a pilot in Manhattan’s Community Board 9, supported by Council Member Shaun Abreu, who declared, “We’re going to start containerizing our trash.” The DSNY report claims containerization could work in 89% of the city but demands a major overhaul: 150,000 curbside parking spots repurposed, hundreds of millions spent on new trucks and bins. The matter summary notes, 'New York City can containerize its sidewalk garbage, but doing so will require a major overhaul of the sanitation system.' Advocates like Christine Berthet call it transformative; others, like car owners, bristle at lost parking. The plan faces political headwinds, but if realized, it could mark a historic shift for city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Change is coming.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Sanitation announced a pilot to eliminate 150,000 free residential parking spaces for trash containerization. The program, starting fall 2023 in West Harlem, covers up to 10 residential blocks and 14 public schools. The DSNY report, with McKinsey input, finds containerization viable for most neighborhoods. The matter aims to 'remove garbage bags from sidewalks' and address public health. Council member Shaun Abreu supports the initiative, calling current practices 'backwards' and endorsing large-scale containerization. Advocates like CHEKPEDS founder Christine Berthet support repurposing parking for trash containers, citing sidewalk access. The city will double trash collection in the pilot area, with $5.7 million allocated. The plan faces challenges in dense areas, but signals a shift toward safer, cleaner streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'The required website would include, but need not be limited to, the following information: case number, general topic, issue, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial of traffic control device, and if approved, the timeline for completion.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by 21 co-sponsors including Williams, Hanif, and Yeger. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided, but the measure aimed to end secrecy around life-saving street changes.
