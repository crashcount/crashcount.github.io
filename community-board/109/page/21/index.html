Fourteen more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch: 1,240 injured, 2,569 crashes. Each figure is a body broken or a life ended. Most are not behind the wheel.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—two deaths, 169 injuries. Trucks and buses added more.

It only takes.</p><h2 id=recent-blood-on-the-asphalt>Recent Blood on the Asphalt</h2><p>Just this May, a 73-year-old man was killed crossing at West 135th. The SUV kept going.
