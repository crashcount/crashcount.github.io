A police car, lights flashing, swerves to avoid a taxi and plows into diners at a sidewalk table. The city calls it an investigation. The people call it pain. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 309 were injured</strong> in crashes across Manhattan Community Board 9. Six were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><h2 id=vulnerable-first-always-last>Vulnerable First, Always Last</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In three years, seven people have died. Over 1,100 have been hurt. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons: <strong>1 death, 59 moderate injuries, 2 serious injuries</strong> from these vehicles alone. Bikes, trucks, taxis—they all leave their mark, but the story is the same. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The curb is not safe.</p><p>On May 27, a police cruiser hit two people eating outside. The NYPD spokesperson said, &ldquo;The chaos erupted as the police cruiser, with lights flashing and sirens blaring, was traveling north on Broadway&mldr; when a cab heading south attempted a leisurely left turn onto West 112th Street&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/us-news/nypd-squad-car-strikes-2-people-in-outdoor-dining-area-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-with-taxi-police/>New York Post</a>). Both diners and officers went to the hospital. The taxi driver got a summons for failing to yield. The investigation is ongoing. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders Talk, Streets Wait</h2><p><strong>Local leaders say the right words.</strong> The city claims progress, touting new speed limits and more cameras. But the blood dries slow. &ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>NY Daily News</a>). Cameras and enforcement help, but the danger remains. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Every day of delay is another roll of the dice for someone crossing the street.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected space for people, not cars. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name on the list. The city will not act unless you force their hand.</p><p><strong>The crisis is slow, but it is relentless. Make your voice relentless too.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The car had been abandoned for over two weeks. Streetsblog’s headline reads: "Streetsblog Gets Action: That Derelict Car in Harlem Has Finally Been Removed." Harlem resident Wendy Frank reported the car to the 32nd Precinct in late December. She continues to press city agencies to clear other derelict and abandoned vehicles nearby. The Sanitation Department handles derelict cars, while NYPD deals with abandoned ones. Frank’s persistence forced action, but the city’s slow response leaves more hazards on Harlem streets. No council bill or formal vote was involved in this enforcement action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The car sat in a cross-hatched no-parking zone, blocking pedestrian space. Resident Wendy Frank filed complaints with the 32nd Precinct and 311, and alerted Assembly Member Al Taylor’s office. Taylor did not respond. The Department of Sanitation, after media inquiry, updated the complaint and police finally tagged the car for removal. The matter highlights civic dysfunction: 'This has become a problem for area residents and it is frustrating that the issue is not being addressed by the city and our elected representatives,' Frank said. The city’s slow response left vulnerable road users exposed to danger, showing systemic neglect.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
