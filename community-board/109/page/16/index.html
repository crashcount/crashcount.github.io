Bikes, trucks, taxis—they all leave their mark, but the story is the same. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The curb is not safe.</p><p>On May 27, a police cruiser hit two people eating outside. The NYPD spokesperson said, &ldquo;The chaos erupted as the police cruiser, with lights flashing and sirens blaring, was traveling north on Broadway&mldr; when a cab heading south attempted a leisurely left turn onto West 112th Street&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/us-news/nypd-squad-car-strikes-2-people-in-outdoor-dining-area-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-with-taxi-police/>New York Post</a>). Both diners and officers went to the hospital. The taxi driver got a summons for failing to yield. The investigation is ongoing. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders Talk, Streets Wait</h2><p><strong>Local leaders say the right words.</strong> The city claims progress, touting new speed limits and more cameras. But the blood dries slow. &ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>NY Daily News</a>). Cameras and enforcement help, but the danger remains. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Every day of delay is another roll of the dice for someone crossing the street.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected space for people, not cars. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name on the list. The city will not act unless you force their hand.</p><p><strong>The crisis is slow, but it is relentless.

Change is coming.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Sanitation announced a pilot to eliminate 150,000 free residential parking spaces for trash containerization. The program, starting fall 2023 in West Harlem, covers up to 10 residential blocks and 14 public schools. The DSNY report, with McKinsey input, finds containerization viable for most neighborhoods. The matter aims to 'remove garbage bags from sidewalks' and address public health. Council member Shaun Abreu supports the initiative, calling current practices 'backwards' and endorsing large-scale containerization. Advocates like CHEKPEDS founder Christine Berthet support repurposing parking for trash containers, citing sidewalk access. The city will double trash collection in the pilot area, with $5.7 million allocated. The plan faces challenges in dense areas, but signals a shift toward safer, cleaner streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
