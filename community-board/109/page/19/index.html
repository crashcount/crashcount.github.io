Fourteen left with serious injuries. In the last three and a half years, Manhattan CB9 has seen 2,470 crashes. The numbers are blunt. Behind them are bodies—pedestrians, cyclists, children. A 73-year-old man, crossing at 135th Street, struck by an SUV and left semiconscious, bleeding from the head. A cyclist, ejected and killed by an SUV at St. Nicholas and 155th. These are not accidents. They are the price of inaction.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>The carnage does not slow. In the past twelve months alone, 342 people have been injured in crashes here. One person died. Serious injuries are up 50% from the year before. The wounds are not abstract. They are broken bones, blood on the street, a child in the back seat of a car struck by a runaway food cart loaded with propane tanks. &ldquo;Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>reported the NY Daily News</a>. The woman and child inside survived. This time.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h2><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Senator Cordell Cleare <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to curb repeat speeders</a> with speed-limiting tech, a step toward fewer deaths. Council Member Shaun Abreu has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks</a> and called out unsafe detours that force cyclists into danger. But the streets remain deadly. The policies come slow. The bodies pile up faster.</p><h2 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h2><p>Every crash is preventable. Every delay is a choice. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and end the reign of repeat offenders. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, more protected crossings, and real enforcement. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, not yet a formal bill, launches with a pilot in Manhattan’s Community Board 9, supported by Council Member Shaun Abreu, who declared, “We’re going to start containerizing our trash.” The DSNY report claims containerization could work in 89% of the city but demands a major overhaul: 150,000 curbside parking spots repurposed, hundreds of millions spent on new trucks and bins. The matter summary notes, 'New York City can containerize its sidewalk garbage, but doing so will require a major overhaul of the sanitation system.' Advocates like Christine Berthet call it transformative; others, like car owners, bristle at lost parking.

The program, starting fall 2023 in West Harlem, covers up to 10 residential blocks and 14 public schools. The DSNY report, with McKinsey input, finds containerization viable for most neighborhoods. The matter aims to 'remove garbage bags from sidewalks' and address public health. Council member Shaun Abreu supports the initiative, calling current practices 'backwards' and endorsing large-scale containerization. Advocates like CHEKPEDS founder Christine Berthet support repurposing parking for trash containers, citing sidewalk access. The city will double trash collection in the pilot area, with $5.7 million allocated. The plan faces challenges in dense areas, but signals a shift toward safer, cleaner streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
