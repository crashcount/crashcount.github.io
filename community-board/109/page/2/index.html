Fourteen more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch: 1,240 injured, 2,569 crashes. Each figure is a body broken or a life ended. Most are not behind the wheel.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—two deaths, 169 injuries. Trucks and buses added more.

It only takes.</p><h2 id=recent-blood-on-the-asphalt>Recent Blood on the Asphalt</h2><p>Just this May, a 73-year-old man was killed crossing at West 135th. The SUV kept going.

The bills, led by Council Members Jennifer Gutiérrez, Sandy Nurse, and Shaun Abreu, require all apps to pay minimum wage and restore upfront tipping. The matter summary: 'regulate the app-based delivery industry.' Sophia Lebowitz supported the action. Advocates say the package strengthens 2023's pay law.

Video shows the vehicles touching in a V shape. Investigator Nelson Yu, a retired NYPD detective, confronted the woman, demanding identification and handcuffing her after she failed to produce ID. Yu ordered, 'Get out of the car and show some ID,' and later, 'Get in the car! You're not going anywhere!' The woman was placed in the back seat of Yu’s vehicle. The arrest was later voided. The Attorney General’s office stated, 'OAG is investigating this matter internally and will not have further comment at this time.'

Streets stay risky.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit (2025-06-19) reports that despite Mayor Eric Adams's proposal for a 15 mph speed limit on e-bikes, shops in Manhattan still advertise illegal speed modifications. Adams admits the plan is 'an idea' needing state approval and a lengthy rulemaking process. Critics like Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives call the proposal 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' arguing it unfairly targets cyclists while drivers face lesser consequences for greater harm. Janet Schroeder of the NYC E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the limit will matter without enforcement: 'The 15 mph speed limit does nothing.' The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor infractions. The article highlights the policy gap and enforcement challenges, with no immediate relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly. The bill's technical fixes aim to keep protections in place for children and other vulnerable road users near schools.
