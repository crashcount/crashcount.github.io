A police car, lights flashing, swerves to avoid a taxi and plows into diners at a sidewalk table. The city calls it an investigation. The people call it pain. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 309 were injured</strong> in crashes across Manhattan Community Board 9. Six were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><h2 id=vulnerable-first-always-last>Vulnerable First, Always Last</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In three years, seven people have died. Over 1,100 have been hurt. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons: <strong>1 death, 59 moderate injuries, 2 serious injuries</strong> from these vehicles alone. Bikes, trucks, taxis—they all leave their mark, but the story is the same. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The curb is not safe.</p><p>On May 27, a police cruiser hit two people eating outside. The NYPD spokesperson said, &ldquo;The chaos erupted as the police cruiser, with lights flashing and sirens blaring, was traveling north on Broadway&mldr; when a cab heading south attempted a leisurely left turn onto West 112th Street&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/us-news/nypd-squad-car-strikes-2-people-in-outdoor-dining-area-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-with-taxi-police/>New York Post</a>). Both diners and officers went to the hospital. The taxi driver got a summons for failing to yield. The investigation is ongoing. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders Talk, Streets Wait</h2><p><strong>Local leaders say the right words.</strong> The city claims progress, touting new speed limits and more cameras. But the blood dries slow. &ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>NY Daily News</a>). Cameras and enforcement help, but the danger remains. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Every day of delay is another roll of the dice for someone crossing the street.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected space for people, not cars. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name on the list. The city will not act unless you force their hand.</p><p><strong>The crisis is slow, but it is relentless. Make your voice relentless too.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The hearing spotlighted the Commercial Waste Zones law, which aims to cut crashes by limiting private trash haulers in each zone. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, author of the 2019 reform, and Council Member Shaun Abreu led the charge, questioning why companies like Cogent Waste Solutions—with poor safety records—were awarded contracts. Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial.

The move comes before the city’s new Commercial Waste Zone program launches this fall. Council Members Shaun Abreu and Sandy Nurse raised alarms, asking, 'how the city awarded a contract to a company with a history of endangering workers to begin with.' Cogent’s trucks have killed one, injured four, and racked up hundreds of violations. Despite this, DSNY allowed Cogent to win contracts in four waste zones. DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.' The oversight hearing exposes a system that lets reckless firms operate, even as new rules loom.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
