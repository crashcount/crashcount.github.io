Fourteen more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch: 1,240 injured, 2,569 crashes. Each figure is a body broken or a life ended. Most are not behind the wheel.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—two deaths, 169 injuries. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles left their own mark. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h2 id=recent-blood-on-the-asphalt>Recent Blood on the Asphalt</h2><p>Just this May, a 73-year-old man was killed crossing at West 135th. The SUV kept going.

The matter, described as a 'lack of a concrete plan from New York State leaders,' sits unresolved. Assembly Member Micah Lasher calls for regional funding, arguing suburbs benefit most. City lawmakers oppose a payroll tax hike limited to New York City. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie offers only vague assurances. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warns the capital plan is as vital as Medicare. Federal officials, including U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, criticize subway neglect and demand improvements before aid. Gov. Hochul’s office claims progress and urges fair federal funding. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The system’s decay puts riders at risk. The clock ticks.

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) will launch the program by June 1, 2025, with nearly 80% of apartments participating. The pilot, which follows earlier bin tests, repurposes parking spots for stationary bins. Abreu, co-sponsoring a bill with Council Member Crystal Hudson, called the shift 'a necessary public good' despite the loss of parking. The bill would require on-street containers for buildings with 10 or more units citywide by 2032. Advocates and DSNY officials highlight the benefit for pedestrians: 'People don’t want garbage on the sidewalk, and it makes perfect sense to put it in the roadway.' The pilot will run for a year, aiming to clear sidewalks and improve safety for those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both vehicles were stationary before impact. The bus was also parked, with damage to its center front end. The SUV carried two occupants, including a 48-year-old female front passenger who sustained a neck injury described as whiplash and was conscious after the crash. The report cites slippery pavement as a contributing factor, indicating loss of vehicle control. No driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding are explicitly listed, but the collision with a parked vehicle suggests a failure to maintain control under adverse conditions. The passenger’s injury and the vehicle damage confirm the force of impact.
