Fourteen left with serious injuries. In the last three and a half years, Manhattan CB9 has seen 2,470 crashes. The numbers are blunt. Behind them are bodies—pedestrians, cyclists, children. A 73-year-old man, crossing at 135th Street, struck by an SUV and left semiconscious, bleeding from the head. A cyclist, ejected and killed by an SUV at St. Nicholas and 155th. These are not accidents. They are the price of inaction.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>The carnage does not slow. In the past twelve months alone, 342 people have been injured in crashes here. One person died. Serious injuries are up 50% from the year before. The wounds are not abstract. They are broken bones, blood on the street, a child in the back seat of a car struck by a runaway food cart loaded with propane tanks. &ldquo;Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>reported the NY Daily News</a>. The woman and child inside survived. This time.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h2><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Senator Cordell Cleare <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to curb repeat speeders</a> with speed-limiting tech, a step toward fewer deaths. Council Member Shaun Abreu has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks</a> and called out unsafe detours that force cyclists into danger. But the streets remain deadly. The policies come slow. The bodies pile up faster.</p><h2 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h2><p>Every crash is preventable. Every delay is a choice. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and end the reign of repeat offenders. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, more protected crossings, and real enforcement. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
