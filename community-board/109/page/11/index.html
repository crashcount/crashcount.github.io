Fourteen more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch: 1,240 injured, 2,569 crashes. Each figure is a body broken or a life ended. Most are not behind the wheel.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—two deaths, 169 injuries. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles left their own mark. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h2 id=recent-blood-on-the-asphalt>Recent Blood on the Asphalt</h2><p>Just this May, a 73-year-old man was killed crossing at West 135th. The SUV kept going.

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

The detour, implemented with scant notice, lacks protected bike lanes and clear signage. Cyclists must share space with cars, cross highway ramps, and navigate steep slopes. The matter, described as 'shortsighted' by Council Member Shaun Abreu, repeats failures from a similar closure four years ago. Abreu urged the city to create a 'sustainable, workable detour' for vulnerable riders. Cyclists voiced frustration and fear, with some riding on pedestrian paths or even the highway to avoid danger. The city’s reliance on 'Share the Road' signs and sharrows leaves riders exposed. The detour has led to nearly one injury per week, highlighting the city’s disregard for cyclist safety during infrastructure work.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT proposal, intended to speed up the M96 bus for 15,000 daily riders, would repurpose a travel lane in each direction while preserving curb parking. Abreu stated, "I wouldn’t say I’m opposed or in favor at this point," but called for more clarity and adjustments from DOT. The matter, described as a push to 'torpedo planned bus lane on 96th Street,' has drawn support from East Side's Community Board 8 and opposition from West Side locals and Council Member Gale Brewer, who suggested alternatives like bus signal priority. The debate centers on balancing transit improvements with residential curb access.

The matter, described as a 'City Council member public statement/rally regarding bus lane project,' saw Brewer call on DOT to remove two blocks from the crosstown bus lane plan, citing the area's 'residential character' and questioning the need due to 'current bus speeds.' Brewer, who once backed bus lanes on 14th, 34th, and 181st Streets, now argued for alternatives and said, 'I'm a bus rider who takes this bus every day. It's not slow.' DOT countered that parking would be preserved and loading zones added. Transit advocates criticized Brewer for ignoring data on slow westbound buses and the needs of 15,000 daily riders. Council Member Shaun Abreu, who represents the district, did not attend and stated he does not oppose the bus lane.

The law orders the Department of Transportation to post current bicycle and micromobility ridership data online, updated monthly or at least yearly. The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Restler, Hudson, Schulman, and others. The law demands transparency on where riders travel and what DOT does to keep them safe. This opens the books on bike movement and exposes gaps in protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian sustained back injuries and was in shock. The collision involved a 2018 Honda sedan registered in New Jersey, which was parked before the crash and struck the pedestrian with its right front quarter panel, causing damage to that area. A 2016 New York-licensed taxi was also present, entering a parked position, but it sustained no damage and was not involved in the impact. The report lists no specific contributing factors or driver errors, but the pedestrian’s crossing without a signal is noted. No driver license or behavioral violations are cited.

Pedestrians and residents gain cleaner, safer space.</p><p class=mb3>On August 8, 2024, Councilmember Shaun Abreu, chair of the City Council's sanitation committee, announced the expansion of a sanitation pilot in District 7. The Department of Sanitation will install up to 1,500 large, Madrid-made bins in West Harlem parking spaces, targeting buildings with more than 31 units. The pilot, launched last year, replaces sidewalk trash bags with secure, stationary bins. Abreu said, 'I couldn’t be more thrilled that Barcelona is making its way to New York City – but unfortunately for the rats, that means no tapas for them.' The bins, emptied by new trucks, have already reduced rat complaints and cleaned up streets. Some residents worry about lost parking, but others, like Esther Yoon, praise the cleaner, safer sidewalks. The city will spend up to $700,000 annually on the program, aiming to expand across all boroughs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
