Fourteen more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch: 1,240 injured, 2,569 crashes. Each figure is a body broken or a life ended. Most are not behind the wheel.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—two deaths, 169 injuries. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles left their own mark. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h2 id=recent-blood-on-the-asphalt>Recent Blood on the Asphalt</h2><p>Just this May, a 73-year-old man was killed crossing at West 135th. The SUV kept going.

The bill, now before the City Council, would require apps to let customers tip at checkout and set a minimum gratuity suggestion of 10%. The measure responds to recent app changes that made tipping harder, slashing delivery workers’ earnings. Abreu called it 'the most common sense bill for not only Deliveristas but consumers.' The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection stated it does not endorse the app companies’ decisions and will review the legislation. Abreu is also working on a pay transparency bill. The legislation seeks to restore lost income for delivery workers, who rely on tips to survive.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bill pushes complete street design. Aim: safer roads for all. Pedestrians, cyclists, and riders get space. Car dominance challenged. Lawmakers move to cut street carnage.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 2714, titled 'Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles,' advanced through committee and passed several Senate votes, most recently on March 27, 2024. Sponsored by Timothy M. Kennedy with support from Jake Ashby, Jamaal Bailey, and others, the bill mandates street designs that protect everyone—not just drivers. The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The bill marks a shift away from car-first planning, forcing cities to build streets for people, not just traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
