A police car, lights flashing, swerves to avoid a taxi and plows into diners at a sidewalk table. The city calls it an investigation. The people call it pain. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 309 were injured</strong> in crashes across Manhattan Community Board 9. Six were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><h2 id=vulnerable-first-always-last>Vulnerable First, Always Last</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In three years, seven people have died. Over 1,100 have been hurt. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons: <strong>1 death, 59 moderate injuries, 2 serious injuries</strong> from these vehicles alone. Bikes, trucks, taxis—they all leave their mark, but the story is the same. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The curb is not safe.</p><p>On May 27, a police cruiser hit two people eating outside. The NYPD spokesperson said, &ldquo;The chaos erupted as the police cruiser, with lights flashing and sirens blaring, was traveling north on Broadway&mldr; when a cab heading south attempted a leisurely left turn onto West 112th Street&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/us-news/nypd-squad-car-strikes-2-people-in-outdoor-dining-area-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-with-taxi-police/>New York Post</a>). Both diners and officers went to the hospital. The taxi driver got a summons for failing to yield. The investigation is ongoing. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders Talk, Streets Wait</h2><p><strong>Local leaders say the right words.</strong> The city claims progress, touting new speed limits and more cameras. But the blood dries slow. &ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>NY Daily News</a>). Cameras and enforcement help, but the danger remains. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Every day of delay is another roll of the dice for someone crossing the street.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected space for people, not cars. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name on the list. The city will not act unless you force their hand.</p><p><strong>The crisis is slow, but it is relentless. Make your voice relentless too.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection stated it does not endorse the app companies’ decisions and will review the legislation. Abreu is also working on a pay transparency bill.

The project is not a council bill but a protracted standoff, with the MTA and local officials pressing Columbia to fund full ADA accessibility. The university will pay to widen escalators but insists public funds should cover elevators, citing project approval before the Zoning for Accessibility law (October 2021). Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine calls elevator access 'the top priority among station accessibility projects in the borough.' Assembly Member Daniel O’Donnell’s office slams Columbia’s lack of transparency and urges investment, noting the school’s $13-billion endowment and $179 million in tax breaks. Students and disabled riders face daily hardship. The MTA, Council Member Shaun Abreu, and advocates push for progress, but Columbia stalls. No elevator, no access.

The bill's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing priority for sidewalk repairs at developments operated by the New York city housing authority.' Council Members Alexa Avilés (primary sponsor), Shaun Abreu, Farah N. Louis, Rafael Salamanca, Jr., Lincoln Restler, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Sandy Nurse, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, and Shahana K. Hanif back the measure. The bill forces DOT to fix sidewalks at NYCHA senior housing first, then other NYCHA sites. DOT must also publish repair lists and schedules. The move targets dangerous, crumbling sidewalks where NYCHA residents—especially seniors—face daily risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
