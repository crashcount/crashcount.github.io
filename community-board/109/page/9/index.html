Fourteen more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch: 1,240 injured, 2,569 crashes. Each figure is a body broken or a life ended. Most are not behind the wheel.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—two deaths, 169 injuries. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles left their own mark. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h2 id=recent-blood-on-the-asphalt>Recent Blood on the Asphalt</h2><p>Just this May, a 73-year-old man was killed crossing at West 135th. The SUV kept going.

The city sent Williams’ family a bill.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (2024-12-23) reports that NYPD body camera footage shows an officer veering into the path of Samuel Williams, a 36-year-old dirt bike rider, during a pursuit on the University Heights Bridge. Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation. The case raises questions about police pursuit tactics and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bottcher leads, joined by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and over two dozen co-sponsors. The law orders the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections each year, up from 100. The city must also run outreach and education. The bill aims to keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike. No more hiding behind parked cars.
