The crash happened in a painted, unprotected bike lane. The driver 'failed to yield to the cyclist,' police said, but was not charged. Advocates blame the lack of protected infrastructure: 'The road diet works where it's been installed and it's needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,' said Kevin LaCherra. The city had planned to remove a lane for cars, but left two lanes for traffic and an unprotected bike lane after political intervention.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
