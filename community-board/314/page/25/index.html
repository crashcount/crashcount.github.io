The old and the young, all at risk.</p><h3 id=the-city-respondsslowly>The City Responds—Slowly</h3><p>The city knows the danger. Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections. The Department of Transportation is adding hard barriers—granite, concrete, planters—to corners where cars once hid the view. &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city is rolling out these changes at high-crash sites like Ocean Avenue. But the pace is slow. Advocates want more, faster. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to see some simpler hardening at a quicker pace,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>said Jackson Chabot</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-enough>Leadership: Words, Not Enough</h3><p>After a school bus crashed into a fence at Bedford Avenue and Farragut Road, injuring a mother and her son, Councilmember Farrah Louis said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad this isn&rsquo;t a fatality. We do know we need more traffic safety in this area.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>reported CBS New York</a>. But words do not stop cars. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to harden every corner. It has not used them all.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-change><strong>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Change</strong></h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit.

The letter states, 'E-bikes are legal to ride on New York City streets and make moving around the city more accessible without adding more pollution and congestion.' The council members oppose the Parks Department’s policy that classifies e-bikes as motor vehicles, grouping them with SUVs and trucks. They argue this ban blocks access for delivery workers, families, older adults, and people with limited transit options. The lawmakers call for a new policy that permits e-bikes while addressing safety concerns, insisting the current rule undermines city values of accessibility and environmental care.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This would let New York City set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets in the Open Streets program. The matter, titled 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass...S.315/A.1416, which would authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program,' was sponsored by Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, Amanda Farías, Julie Won, Carlina Rivera, and Crystal Hudson. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The measure aimed to protect pedestrians and cyclists by slowing traffic where people gather. But with the bill stalled, Open Streets remain at risk from fast-moving vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Farah N. Louis (primary) and co-sponsored by Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Shekar Krishnan, Charles Barron, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Lincoln Restler, and Rita C. Joseph, required the Department of Transportation to investigate all serious vehicular crashes. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to investigate vehicle collisions.' The bill would have expanded the definition of serious crashes, set strict investigation timelines, and mandated detailed public reports. It also called for reviews of street design and infrastructure at crash sites, with recommendations for safety improvements.

Introduced December 7, 2022, and filed at session’s end, the resolution states: “calls upon the New York State Legislature to amend state law to make implementation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s congestion pricing plan... subject to a statewide ballot proposal.” Council Member Kamillah Hanks led sponsorship, joined by Borelli, Carr, Louis, Yeger, Ariola, and Paladino. The sponsors raise concerns about pollution, health, and traffic impacts on outer-borough communities. The measure questions whether congestion pricing will cut traffic or fund transit improvements. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users is assessed. The bill remains filed, with no further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
