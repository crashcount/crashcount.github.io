The driver faces manslaughter charges.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on April 16, 2025, that Miriam Yarimi was arraigned after a deadly Brooklyn crash. Prosecutors say Yarimi, a repeat speed and red-light violator, sped through a red light and struck an Uber before hitting Natasha Saada and her two daughters as they crossed Ocean Parkway. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called it 'one of the worst' crashes he had seen, stating, 'This defendant's unconscionably dangerous driving wiped out a family.' Yarimi was driving with a suspended license. Authorities noted that drivers with multiple camera violations can avoid car seizure by paying fines, exposing policy loopholes. The crash left a four-year-old boy hospitalized with severe injuries. Yarimi faces up to 45 years if convicted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
