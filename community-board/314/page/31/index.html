The hurt clusters on long, fast blocks and at corners built for speed.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks-you>Where the street breaks you</h3><ul><li><a href=#>Flatbush Avenue</a> leads the injury roll with 164 hurt and 7 seriously hurt; one person died. The state calls it by name in the crash log: FLATBUSH AVENUE. The wounds keep coming.</li><li><a href=#>Ocean Avenue</a> is next, with 126 injuries and 2 serious injuries. No mystery why people fear the crossing.</li></ul><p>Late afternoon is the danger hour. Death peaks at 2 p.m. and 6–7 p.m., with sharp injury surges through the school rush. The dataset shows 3 deaths at 2 p.m., 3 at 6 p.m., and another at 5 and 7 p.m. The clock is part of the weapon.</p><p>Trucks turn. People die. On Tilden and Bedford, a dump truck making a right killed a woman crossing with the signal, with “Failure to Yield” listed in the record (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4707890</a>). A cyclist on Avenue O never made it home after colliding with a westbound SUV (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4709603</a>). A right‑turning SUV killed a 73‑year‑old at Avenue L and E 12th, the log shows (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4775450</a>).</p><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm to people on foot here: 542 pedestrian injuries and 6 pedestrian deaths sit under “suvs_cars.” Trucks and buses add 37 more pedestrian casualties, with 3 deaths. The bodies are soft. The machines are not.</p><h3 id=officials-talk-the-street-waits>Officials talk. The street waits.</h3><p>Council Member Farah Louis signed onto a 60‑day clock for school‑adjacent safety hardware: “complete the installation… by no later than 60 days after the department issues such traffic study determination,” the bill says (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>). It would move paint, posts, and lights faster where children cross.</p><p>She also co‑sponsored a crackdown on unlicensed commuter vans (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347‑2025</a>). Streets bleed from many sources. Unlicensed operators add to the pile.</p><p>Up the chain, State Sen. Kevin Parker voted yes—again and again—in committee to force repeat speeders to use intelligent speed assistance (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>). The bill targets drivers who rack up violations and keeps their cars from breaking the limit.</p><h3 id=pattern-on-flatbush-turning-steel-repeat-harm>Pattern on Flatbush: turning steel, repeat harm</h3><p>The small‑area analysis points to “Failure to Yield,” “Inattention/Distraction,” and heavy right turns. The scar shows at corners. The victims are walkers and riders. Pedestrians account for 9 deaths and 609 injuries. Cyclists: 2 deaths, 293 injuries. The hours with the most injuries are 2–6 p.m., with a hard spike at 5 p.m. (192 injuries). This is when kids are out, when light fades in winter, when rush burns.</p><p>“Other” causes dominate the city’s ledger here, with 15 deaths and 1,039 injuries classed that way. But the bodies tell a simpler story: big vehicles, fast approaches, bad turns. The crash file for Tilden and Bedford lists “Oversized Vehicle.” The dead had the light.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-bleeding>What would stop the bleeding</h3><ul><li>Daylight the corners on Flatbush Avenue and Ocean Avenue. Pull parking back from crosswalks. Harden the turns so trucks must slow. Use concrete, not just paint.</li><li>Give every signal Leading Pedestrian Intervals at these corridors and near schools; pair them with that 60‑day installation clock already on the Council’s docket (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>).</li><li>Target repeat hotspots with enforcement runs tied to crash hours, not tickets for show. Late‑afternoon focus where deaths and injuries peak.</li></ul><p>Then fix the root.</p><h3 id=citywide-moves-that-save-lives-here>Citywide moves that save lives here</h3><ul><li>Lower speeds. Albany passed the power; the city can set safer limits. Use it. A person struck at lower speeds lives.</li><li>Stop the worst drivers. The State Senate bill to mandate speed limiters for repeat violators advanced with yes votes from Senator Parker (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>).
