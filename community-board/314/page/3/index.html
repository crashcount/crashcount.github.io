The map calls it Brooklyn CB14. The street tells another story.</p><h3 id=the-corners-that-dont-forgive>The corners that don’t forgive</h3><p>Flatbush Avenue leads the harm. One death. 164 injuries. Seven serious injuries since 2022, the most in the district. See the city ledger for <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Flatbush Avenue</a>. Ocean Avenue follows with <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>126 injuries</a>.</p><p>An SUV turned right at Avenue L and East 12th. A 73‑year‑old woman crossing with the signal was hit and killed. The city log lists the point of impact as the center front end. The driver was licensed. The year was 2019 for the Jeep. The date was <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Dec. 1, 2024</a>.</p><p>At Bedford and Tilden, a dump truck made a right turn. Failure to yield, oversized vehicle, the record says. A 58‑year‑old woman crossing with the signal was struck and died. That was <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Mar. 7, 2024</a>.</p><p>A cyclist, 47, was hit head‑on by an SUV near 1608 Avenue O. He was ejected and killed on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Mar. 13, 2024</a>.</p><h3 id=when-the-hours-turn-deadly>When the hours turn deadly</h3><p>The danger spikes after school and into the commute. The 5 p.m. hour brought two deaths and 192 injuries. At 6 p.m., three deaths and 147 injuries. At 2 p.m., three deaths and 173 injuries. The city’s own clock says so in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>.</p><p>Since 2022, nine pedestrians and two cyclists are dead here. Pedestrians suffered 609 injuries and 15 serious injuries. Cyclists: 292 injuries, five serious. The roll‑up shows SUVs and cars as the main killers of people on foot—six pedestrian deaths—followed by trucks and buses with three. The counts are in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district totals</a>.</p><h3 id=what-keeps-breaking-bones>What keeps breaking bones</h3><p>“Failure to yield right‑of‑way.” “Disregarded traffic control.” “Inattention.” The forms use dry words. The bodies don’t. The largest bucket is “other,” with 15 deaths and 1,039 injuries attached to it. Inattention and distraction show 48 injuries and four serious injuries. The sheet is here: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>contributing factors</a>.</p><p>One Audi sedan struck a 64‑year‑old man not in a crosswalk on Flatbush near Caton. Apparent death at the scene, the entry says. That was <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Dec. 31, 2024</a>.</p><h3 id=promises-and-a-thin-fuse>Promises and a thin fuse</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis signed onto a bill to force DOT to install school‑zone safety devices within 60 days after a study says they’re needed. The measure was introduced and sent to committee on Aug. 14, 2025. The file is <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>.</p><p>On the same day, she cosponsored a crackdown on unlicensed commuter vans, ordering maximum penalties for each violation on a checklist. That is <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347‑2025</a>.</p><p>Up in Albany, State Sen. Kevin Parker voted yes in committee to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat speeders under <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. The bill targets drivers who rack up points or multiple camera tickets. Committee votes passed on June 11 and June 12, 2025.</p><h3 id=fix-what-we-can-see>Fix what we can see</h3><p>The harm is concentrated. Two streets—<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Flatbush Avenue</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Ocean Avenue</a>—carry the worst numbers.</p><p>Local fixes are not theory. Daylight the corners so turning drivers can see people crossing. Harden the turns at right‑turn hot spots like Bedford and Tilden. Add leading pedestrian intervals on signalized crossings and keep trucks out of crosswalks while people walk. These are standard tools for right‑turn deaths and failure‑to‑yield cases.</p><h3 id=citywide-steps-that-end-the-cycle>Citywide steps that end the cycle</h3><p>The city now has the power to set safer speeds. Advocates want a lower default limit and action against the worst repeat speeders. Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone cameras and advanced speed limiters for habitual violators. Use the tools.</p><ul><li>Lower the default limit citywide.</li><li>Pass and enforce intelligent speed assistance for repeat speeders, as pushed in <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>.</li></ul><p>Lives hinge on the follow‑through.

The lane shields cyclists from traffic. City Hall wanted it gone. Advocates sued. The court order keeps the barrier. Streets stay safer, for now.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, NY Daily News reported that Judge Carolyn Walker-Diallo issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Adams administration from removing the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn. The city planned to restore the old painted lane, citing complaints about fast bikes and e-bikes. But advocates and residents sued, arguing the old design was unsafe and that 'safety of all road users has improved since the upgraded design was installed.' The judge's order prevents immediate removal, pending an August hearing. Transportation Alternatives called the ruling a win for street safety, saying, 'We won't let anyone make our streets more dangerous.' The case highlights ongoing tension between street safety improvements and city policy decisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists called the move "unwise and unsafe." The article notes the city had previously identified this stretch as among the most dangerous. Officials responded to concerns by painting pedestrian islands and loading zones but did not install physical barriers or bus boarding islands. Cyclists described the decision as political, with one saying, "There’s a very important voting bloc that’s using their leverage over the mayor to remove the bike lane." The mayor’s refusal to sacrifice parking for safety left vulnerable road users exposed.
