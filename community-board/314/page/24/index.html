Struck by a Jeep making a right turn. She died at the intersection. A 47-year-old man riding his bike on Avenue O, hit by an SUV. Dead in the street. A mother and her two daughters, killed crossing Ocean Parkway. Another family, broken, left with pain and fear. The driver had 93 violations and a suspended license. She was still behind the wheel. ABC7 <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-deadly-crash-family-survived-accident-midwood-weekend-left-traumatized/16117277/>reported the survivors&rsquo; wounds</a>: back pain, depression, a child with a cast. The numbers do not heal. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person killed, nine seriously injured, 658 hurt</strong> in 879 crashes in Brooklyn CB14. Children are not spared. <strong>Four kids suffered serious injuries</strong>. The old and the young, all at risk.</p><h3 id=the-city-respondsslowly>The City Responds—Slowly</h3><p>The city knows the danger. Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections. The Department of Transportation is adding hard barriers—granite, concrete, planters—to corners where cars once hid the view. &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city is rolling out these changes at high-crash sites like Ocean Avenue. But the pace is slow. Advocates want more, faster. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to see some simpler hardening at a quicker pace,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>said Jackson Chabot</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-enough>Leadership: Words, Not Enough</h3><p>After a school bus crashed into a fence at Bedford Avenue and Farragut Road, injuring a mother and her son, Councilmember Farrah Louis said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad this isn&rsquo;t a fatality. We do know we need more traffic safety in this area.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>reported CBS New York</a>. But words do not stop cars. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to harden every corner. It has not used them all.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-change><strong>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Change</strong></h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand hard barriers at every dangerous corner. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a> Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill aimed to require the NYPD to post a map of all crossing guard locations on its website. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to reporting on crossing guard deployment.' Council Member Kamillah Hanks led as primary sponsor, joined by Stevens, Louis, Joseph, Farías, Restler, Hudson, Ung, Avilés, and the Bronx Borough President. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. If passed, it would have shed light on where the city protects its most vulnerable at the curb. Instead, the public remains in the dark about guard coverage at dangerous crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
