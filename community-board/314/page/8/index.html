Struck by a Jeep making a right turn. She died at the intersection. A 47-year-old man riding his bike on Avenue O, hit by an SUV. Dead in the street. A mother and her two daughters, killed crossing Ocean Parkway. Another family, broken, left with pain and fear. The driver had 93 violations and a suspended license. She was still behind the wheel. ABC7 <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-deadly-crash-family-survived-accident-midwood-weekend-left-traumatized/16117277/>reported the survivors&rsquo; wounds</a>: back pain, depression, a child with a cast. The numbers do not heal. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person killed, nine seriously injured, 658 hurt</strong> in 879 crashes in Brooklyn CB14. Children are not spared. <strong>Four kids suffered serious injuries</strong>. The old and the young, all at risk.</p><h3 id=the-city-respondsslowly>The City Responds—Slowly</h3><p>The city knows the danger. Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections. The Department of Transportation is adding hard barriers—granite, concrete, planters—to corners where cars once hid the view. &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city is rolling out these changes at high-crash sites like Ocean Avenue. But the pace is slow. Advocates want more, faster. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to see some simpler hardening at a quicker pace,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>said Jackson Chabot</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-enough>Leadership: Words, Not Enough</h3><p>After a school bus crashed into a fence at Bedford Avenue and Farragut Road, injuring a mother and her son, Councilmember Farrah Louis said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad this isn&rsquo;t a fatality. We do know we need more traffic safety in this area.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>reported CBS New York</a>. But words do not stop cars. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to harden every corner. It has not used them all.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-change><strong>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Change</strong></h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand hard barriers at every dangerous corner. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a> Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

She collided with a Toyota Camry, then struck and killed a mother and her two daughters, ages 8 and 6, as they left Shabbat services. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch confirmed Yarimi's license status. The article reports Yarimi had 'over 93 traffic violations on WIGM8KER including 20 speeding tickets,' and a recent ticket for 'speeding through a school zone.' Yarimi was arrested at the scene, but charges were pending at publication. The case highlights persistent dangers for pedestrians and repeated failures to keep high-risk drivers off city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.

Seabrook had been out on bail for a previous crash involving police. On January 8, 2024, he crashed into a Toyota, killing Hayden Wallace and injuring three others. Seabrook fled the scene, abandoning his vehicle. The article notes, "All accidents are useless but this one was even more useless because [Seabrook] had so many other offenses." Seabrook faces 23 charges, including manslaughter, leaving the scene, unlicensed driving, and speeding. The case highlights repeated driver offenses and questions about bail and enforcement. Police needed over a year to arrest Seabrook, who had a history of fleeing crashes and driving without a license.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
