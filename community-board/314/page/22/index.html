Struck by a Jeep making a right turn. She died at the intersection. A 47-year-old man riding his bike on Avenue O, hit by an SUV. Dead in the street. A mother and her two daughters, killed crossing Ocean Parkway. Another family, broken, left with pain and fear. The driver had 93 violations and a suspended license. She was still behind the wheel. ABC7 <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-deadly-crash-family-survived-accident-midwood-weekend-left-traumatized/16117277/>reported the survivors&rsquo; wounds</a>: back pain, depression, a child with a cast. The numbers do not heal. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person killed, nine seriously injured, 658 hurt</strong> in 879 crashes in Brooklyn CB14. Children are not spared. <strong>Four kids suffered serious injuries</strong>. The old and the young, all at risk.</p><h3 id=the-city-respondsslowly>The City Responds—Slowly</h3><p>The city knows the danger. Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections. The Department of Transportation is adding hard barriers—granite, concrete, planters—to corners where cars once hid the view. &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The city is rolling out these changes at high-crash sites like Ocean Avenue. But the pace is slow. Advocates want more, faster. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to see some simpler hardening at a quicker pace,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>said Jackson Chabot</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-enough>Leadership: Words, Not Enough</h3><p>After a school bus crashed into a fence at Bedford Avenue and Farragut Road, injuring a mother and her son, Councilmember Farrah Louis said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad this isn&rsquo;t a fatality. We do know we need more traffic safety in this area.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>reported CBS New York</a>. But words do not stop cars. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to harden every corner. It has not used them all.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-change><strong>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Change</strong></h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand hard barriers at every dangerous corner. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a> Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Damage was reported to the right side doors of the turning SUV and the left front quarter panel of the stopped SUV. Driver errors involving lane changes and ignoring traffic controls caused the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The vote backs millions who depend on buses and trains.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0460-2023 was adopted by the City Council on April 27, 2023, after review by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law requires the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Department for the Aging, to annually install at least one traffic calming device in each designated senior pedestrian zone, with a minimum of fifty devices citywide per year. DOT must report installation locations to the council every year.
