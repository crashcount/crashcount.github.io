The hurt clusters on long, fast blocks and at corners built for speed.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks-you>Where the street breaks you</h3><ul><li><a href=#>Flatbush Avenue</a> leads the injury roll with 164 hurt and 7 seriously hurt; one person died. The state calls it by name in the crash log: FLATBUSH AVENUE. The wounds keep coming.</li><li><a href=#>Ocean Avenue</a> is next, with 126 injuries and 2 serious injuries. No mystery why people fear the crossing.</li></ul><p>Late afternoon is the danger hour. Death peaks at 2 p.m. and 6–7 p.m., with sharp injury surges through the school rush. The dataset shows 3 deaths at 2 p.m., 3 at 6 p.m., and another at 5 and 7 p.m. The clock is part of the weapon.</p><p>Trucks turn. People die. On Tilden and Bedford, a dump truck making a right killed a woman crossing with the signal, with “Failure to Yield” listed in the record (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4707890</a>). A cyclist on Avenue O never made it home after colliding with a westbound SUV (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4709603</a>). A right‑turning SUV killed a 73‑year‑old at Avenue L and E 12th, the log shows (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4775450</a>).</p><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm to people on foot here: 542 pedestrian injuries and 6 pedestrian deaths sit under “suvs_cars.” Trucks and buses add 37 more pedestrian casualties, with 3 deaths. The bodies are soft. The machines are not.</p><h3 id=officials-talk-the-street-waits>Officials talk. The street waits.</h3><p>Council Member Farah Louis signed onto a 60‑day clock for school‑adjacent safety hardware: “complete the installation… by no later than 60 days after the department issues such traffic study determination,” the bill says (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>). It would move paint, posts, and lights faster where children cross.</p><p>She also co‑sponsored a crackdown on unlicensed commuter vans (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347‑2025</a>). Streets bleed from many sources. Unlicensed operators add to the pile.</p><p>Up the chain, State Sen. Kevin Parker voted yes—again and again—in committee to force repeat speeders to use intelligent speed assistance (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>). The bill targets drivers who rack up violations and keeps their cars from breaking the limit.</p><h3 id=pattern-on-flatbush-turning-steel-repeat-harm>Pattern on Flatbush: turning steel, repeat harm</h3><p>The small‑area analysis points to “Failure to Yield,” “Inattention/Distraction,” and heavy right turns. The scar shows at corners. The victims are walkers and riders. Pedestrians account for 9 deaths and 609 injuries. Cyclists: 2 deaths, 293 injuries. The hours with the most injuries are 2–6 p.m., with a hard spike at 5 p.m. (192 injuries). This is when kids are out, when light fades in winter, when rush burns.</p><p>“Other” causes dominate the city’s ledger here, with 15 deaths and 1,039 injuries classed that way. But the bodies tell a simpler story: big vehicles, fast approaches, bad turns. The crash file for Tilden and Bedford lists “Oversized Vehicle.” The dead had the light.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-bleeding>What would stop the bleeding</h3><ul><li>Daylight the corners on Flatbush Avenue and Ocean Avenue. Pull parking back from crosswalks. Harden the turns so trucks must slow. Use concrete, not just paint.</li><li>Give every signal Leading Pedestrian Intervals at these corridors and near schools; pair them with that 60‑day installation clock already on the Council’s docket (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>).</li><li>Target repeat hotspots with enforcement runs tied to crash hours, not tickets for show. Late‑afternoon focus where deaths and injuries peak.</li></ul><p>Then fix the root.</p><h3 id=citywide-moves-that-save-lives-here>Citywide moves that save lives here</h3><ul><li>Lower speeds. Albany passed the power; the city can set safer limits. Use it. A person struck at lower speeds lives.</li><li>Stop the worst drivers. The State Senate bill to mandate speed limiters for repeat violators advanced with yes votes from Senator Parker (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>).

Their son remains hospitalized. The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 21 speeding tickets—15 in school zones—over two years. Lawmakers and advocates called for legislation requiring speed limiter devices on cars of drivers with more than six camera violations. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said the driver 'clearly would've met the threshold.' NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the crash 'a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.' The bill aims to prevent repeat offenders from exceeding speed limits.

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.

The city remains dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (published March 3, 2025) reports a fatal crash in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. A man in his 20s, crouched in the street to pick up food, was struck and killed by a turning dump truck just before 4 a.m. at Withers Street and Woodpoint Road. The NYPD stated, “The driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene.” No arrests have been made. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is investigating. The article notes this was one of several deadly crashes in Brooklyn that week, highlighting ongoing risks for pedestrians and the persistent issue of hit-and-runs. At least 10 people have died in Brooklyn traffic crashes so far this year, matching last year’s pace. The crash underscores the lethal mix of heavy vehicles, vulnerable road users, and gaps in enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
