He was 42. There was no second chance. In the last year, 69 people were injured in crashes across Bronx CB28. One was hurt so badly they may never walk the same. The numbers do not flinch: 77 crashes, 1 dead, 1 seriously injured in twelve months. The road does not care if you are young or old. It takes all the same. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p>Most wounds come from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses are less common, but when they hit, the damage is deep. In three years, not a single cyclist killed. But the pain is spread wide: children, the old, the working. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city has the tools. Sammy’s Law passed. The Council can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The law that keeps them on is up for renewal again. Each delay is another risk. Each silence is a choice.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Streets can be made safe. Lower the speed. Keep the cameras on. Redesign the crossings. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Tell them to act. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
