He was 42. There was no second chance. In the last year, 69 people were injured in crashes across Bronx CB28. One was hurt so badly they may never walk the same. The numbers do not flinch: 77 crashes, 1 dead, 1 seriously injured in twelve months. The road does not care if you are young or old. It takes all the same. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p>Most wounds come from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses are less common, but when they hit, the damage is deep. In three years, not a single cyclist killed. But the pain is spread wide: children, the old, the working. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city has the tools. Sammy’s Law passed. The Council can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The law that keeps them on is up for renewal again. Each delay is another risk. Each silence is a choice.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Streets can be made safe. Lower the speed. Keep the cameras on. Redesign the crossings. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Tell them to act. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The endorsement, reported by Streetsblog NYC and covered by Gersh Kuntzman, followed a review of candidate plans. StreetsPAC called Lander’s proposal 'by far the most comprehensive blueprint ... we've ever seen from a candidate for any office.' Lander promised more protected bike lanes, a citywide Bus Rapid Transit network, and using congestion pricing revenue for busways and bikeways. He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users.

The bill requires drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red-light camera tickets in twelve months, to install intelligent speed assistance devices. Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes led the push, joined by co-sponsors Samra Brouk, Cordell Cleare, and others. The vote passed with support from senators including Jeremy Cooney, Pete Harckham, and Jessica Ramos. The measure aims to rein in repeat offenders and reduce deadly speeding. The bill’s language is blunt: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.'
