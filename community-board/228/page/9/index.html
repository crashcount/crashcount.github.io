He was 42. There was no second chance. In the last year, 69 people were injured in crashes across Bronx CB28. One was hurt so badly they may never walk the same. The numbers do not flinch: 77 crashes, 1 dead, 1 seriously injured in twelve months. The road does not care if you are young or old.

No one is spared.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city has the tools. Sammy’s Law passed. The Council can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not.

Each silence is a choice.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Streets can be made safe. Lower the speed. Keep the cameras on. Redesign the crossings.

The bill extends the hours that speed cameras operate in New York City school zones. Primary sponsor: Senator Gounardes, with co-sponsors Biaggi, Cleare, Gianaris, Hoylman, Jackson, Kavanagh, Krueger, Myrie, Persaud, Ramos, Rivera, and Sepulveda. The measure saw strong support in both chambers, despite some opposition. The bill aims to keep cameras watching when children are at risk. More enforcement, more accountability.
