The proposal, nearing the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) certification, aims to serve Co-op City, Morris Park, Parkchester/Van Nest, and Hunts Point. The session, supported by Councilmember Kristy Marmorato (District 13) and Councilmember Amanda Farias, highlighted the need for faster, more reliable transit. Marmorato said, 'the Metro-North will provide an alternative for drivers dealing with congestion pricing, and for those who might be reluctant to take the subway.' Farias called it part of a 'better transit future.' The Department of City Planning updated residents, reflecting ongoing community feedback.

No license, no sale. Lawmakers push paperwork, not street fixes. Vulnerable users still face the same steel threat.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A 8079, now in sponsorship, sits with the New York State Assembly. Filed September 27, 2023, it aims to require a safety manual, licensing, and insurance for electric scooter operators in New York City. The bill summary reads: 'Establishes a bicycle and electric scooter operator's safety manual; provides for the issuance of a license...; requires liability insurance for electric scooters in cities having a population of one million or more.' Assembly Member John Zaccaro Jr. leads, with Rebecca Seawright, Michael Benedetto, Deborah Glick, Jeffrion Aubry, David McDonough, and Michael Novakhov co-sponsoring. The bill targets paperwork and compliance. It does not address the core dangers faced by pedestrians and cyclists on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
