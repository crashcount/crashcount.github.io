Thirty-five left with serious injuries. Over 2,500 hurt.</strong> These are not distant tragedies. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last year alone, two more lives ended on these streets. Hundreds more were broken—<strong>732 injured, nine left with life-altering wounds</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The violence is relentless. A 16-year-old girl was killed crossing at 47th Avenue and 46th Street. A cyclist, 28, died under the wheels of a turning truck on Greenpoint Avenue. An 18-year-old moped rider lost his life on Laurel Hill Boulevard. The list goes on. Each crash a story cut short.</p><h3 id=speed-may-have-been-an-issue>&ldquo;Speed May Have Been an Issue&rdquo;</h3><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway, <strong>vaulted the divider, and slammed into oncoming cars</strong>. Six people were hurt, two left fighting for their lives. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>said speed may have been an issue</a>. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad closed the highway to pick through the wreckage.

She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame off pedestrians. But the pace is slow. The daylighting bill sits in committee. Promises pile up. Streets stay deadly.</p><p><strong>State Senator Michael Gianaris pushed for the Queensboro Bridge bike-pedestrian split.</strong> It took years. Each delay meant more close calls, more pain.

Call Senator Gianaris. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every intersection be daylighted. Demand action, not excuses. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident sparked a petition—over 26,000 signatures—calling for traffic lights to replace stop signs at three crossings. Gianaris pledged to 'make sure we fix Newtown Road where this happened, and to honor her father's request that there be traffic lights there.' The Department of Transportation upgraded crosswalk markings but has not committed to a traffic light, citing a low crash history. Residents and the victim’s family say the intersection remains dangerous, with drivers ignoring stop signs.

The hearing, part of the state budget process, saw Lieber defend Governor Hochul’s proposed 5.5-percent fare increase as a return to regular hikes paused during the pandemic. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and colleagues pushed the 'Fix the MTA' package to freeze fares, boost service, and make buses free. Mamdani argued, 'It is simply not acceptable to put the cost of a basic public good on the backs of working class New Yorkers.' Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris criticized Lieber for insisting on fare hikes while dismissing other budget solutions. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas opposed making her constituents pay more. Lieber expressed concern about free buses, preferring targeted affordability programs. The hearing highlighted a sharp divide: lawmakers want to protect riders; the MTA wants stable funding. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
