The delay? “Not satisfactory,” electeds wrote earlier, warning that waiting “will unnecessarily put at risk” thousands walking and biking the cramped path. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-completes-long-stalled-plan-to-separate-bikes-and-pedestrians-on-queensboro-bridge>Gothamist</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h3 id=slow-them-down-or-count-the-dead>Slow them down or count the dead</h3><p>The state renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. Local reps backed it. The next step targets the worst repeaters. In Albany, Senator Michael Gianaris voted yes to move a speed‑limiter bill. Assembly Members Steven Raga and Claire Valdez co‑sponsor the Assembly version.
