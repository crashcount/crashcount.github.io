Thirty-five left with serious injuries. Over 2,500 hurt.</strong> These are not distant tragedies. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last year alone, two more lives ended on these streets. Hundreds more were broken—<strong>732 injured, nine left with life-altering wounds</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The violence is relentless. A 16-year-old girl was killed crossing at 47th Avenue and 46th Street. A cyclist, 28, died under the wheels of a turning truck on Greenpoint Avenue. An 18-year-old moped rider lost his life on Laurel Hill Boulevard. The list goes on. Each crash a story cut short.</p><h3 id=speed-may-have-been-an-issue>&ldquo;Speed May Have Been an Issue&rdquo;</h3><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway, <strong>vaulted the divider, and slammed into oncoming cars</strong>. Six people were hurt, two left fighting for their lives. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>said speed may have been an issue</a>. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad closed the highway to pick through the wreckage.

She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame off pedestrians. But the pace is slow. The daylighting bill sits in committee. Promises pile up. Streets stay deadly.</p><p><strong>State Senator Michael Gianaris pushed for the Queensboro Bridge bike-pedestrian split.</strong> It took years. Each delay meant more close calls, more pain.

Call Senator Gianaris. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every intersection be daylighted. Demand action, not excuses. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Nydia Velázquez led a Queens town hall to rally opposition against Trump Administration policies, including the federal move to block New York City's congestion pricing plan. The event, held at Sunnyside Community Services, featured Council Member Julie Won (District 26) and other local officials. The panel condemned the rollback of protections for immigrants and the firing of NLRB board member Gwynne A. Wilcox. Velázquez declared, 'We’ll see him in court,' after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revoked federal approval for congestion pricing. She pledged to fight budget cuts targeting vulnerable communities and criticized tax breaks for the wealthy. Julie Won joined the call for grassroots activism. The town hall spotlighted the threat to New York’s sovereignty and the urgent need to defend city streets and programs from federal interference.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license. The case highlights the lethal risk of unlicensed driving and the dangers of stopped vehicles on high-speed roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
