A 28-year-old woman, thrown from her bike, killed by a turning truck. An 8-year-old, head bloodied, pulled from a wreck on the BQE. In the last twelve months, three people died and nine suffered serious injuries on the streets of Queens CB2. There were 1,222 crashes. Twenty-eight children under 18 were injured. One did not come home.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars led the count. In three years, they killed four, left three with serious injuries, and caused 52 moderate injuries to pedestrians. Trucks and buses hurt eight more. Bikes and mopeds, too, left their mark—no deaths, two serious injuries, eight moderate. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city says it is fighting for safer streets. Speed cameras now run all day. The law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras are not everywhere. The city says, &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many&rdquo; <a href=../../take_action/>said Mayor Adams</a>. But the deaths keep coming. The city can act. It waits.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p>A bolt fell from the No. 7 train at Queens Plaza, smashing a windshield, spraying glass over the driver and passenger. &ldquo;I thought we were being shot at at the time because the velocity of the metal it hit so hard that for a second I thought it was a bullet,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/exclusive-debris-subway-tracks-shattered-mans-windshield-dented-car-queens/16217411/>said Rahimi</a>. The city has known about falling debris for years. The danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand action. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The sedan’s driver, a 52-year-old male, sustained abrasions to his elbow, lower arm, and hand but was conscious and wearing a lap belt and harness. The sedan’s passenger, a 24-year-old male, suffered a concussion and head injury; he was also conscious and restrained. The passenger’s injuries were compounded by the SUV driver’s failure to maintain a safe following distance, noted as "Following Too Closely." Neither occupant was ejected. The collision highlights the dangers of driver distraction and tailgating on high-speed roadways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Night air thick with sirens and the cold bite of metal.</p><p class=mb3>A violent collision unfolded at 43rd Street and 50th Avenue in Queens when a Tesla sedan turned left and struck a moped traveling straight, according to the police report. The crash occurred at 8:15 p.m. The report details that the moped rider, a 26-year-old man, suffered severe crush injuries to his leg and was conscious at the scene. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors. The moped rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the driver errors. The Tesla’s left front bumper collided with the moped’s right front, sending the rider to the pavement. The police report’s language—'Steel struck flesh. A 26-year-old man crumpled to the pavement, leg crushed'—underscores the brutal impact and the dangers faced by vulnerable road users when drivers fail to yield or pay attention.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
