Thirty-five left with serious injuries. Over 2,500 hurt.</strong> These are not distant tragedies. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last year alone, two more lives ended on these streets. Hundreds more were broken—<strong>732 injured, nine left with life-altering wounds</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The violence is relentless. A 16-year-old girl was killed crossing at 47th Avenue and 46th Street. A cyclist, 28, died under the wheels of a turning truck on Greenpoint Avenue. An 18-year-old moped rider lost his life on Laurel Hill Boulevard. The list goes on. Each crash a story cut short.</p><h3 id=speed-may-have-been-an-issue>&ldquo;Speed May Have Been an Issue&rdquo;</h3><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway, <strong>vaulted the divider, and slammed into oncoming cars</strong>. Six people were hurt, two left fighting for their lives. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>said speed may have been an issue</a>. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad closed the highway to pick through the wreckage.

She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame off pedestrians. But the pace is slow. The daylighting bill sits in committee. Promises pile up. Streets stay deadly.</p><p><strong>State Senator Michael Gianaris pushed for the Queensboro Bridge bike-pedestrian split.</strong> It took years. Each delay meant more close calls, more pain.

Call Senator Gianaris. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every intersection be daylighted. Demand action, not excuses. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say low fees fuel car ownership, crowding out transit, bikes, and green space. Experts warn it’s a subsidy for drivers, not a fix for congestion or emissions.</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2023, a Senate proposal surfaced to create a Residential Parking Permit system in New York City. The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to install at least 100 miles of protected bicycle lanes annually until 2029. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of protected bicycle lanes.' Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Sandy Nurse, Erik D. Bottcher, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Shekar Krishnan, Julie Won, Chi A. Ossé, Tiffany Cabán, Christopher Marte, Crystal Hudson, and Rita C. Joseph. The bill was filed at the end of session, never enacted. The city’s protected bike lane network remains incomplete. Cyclists and other vulnerable road users still face daily risk from cars and trucks. The bill’s failure leaves the city’s most exposed travelers in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
