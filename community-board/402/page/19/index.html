Critics say low fees fuel car ownership, crowding out transit, bikes, and green space. Experts warn it’s a subsidy for drivers, not a fix for congestion or emissions.</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2023, a Senate proposal surfaced to create a Residential Parking Permit system in New York City. The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill targets congestion, collisions, and harm to neighborhoods. It demands hard numbers on vehicle flow, street damage, and danger to people outside cars.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0923-2023 was introduced on February 16, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsored the bill, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate, and others. The report was due by December 31, 2023. The bill was filed at the end of session with no report issued. The measure aimed to examine street redesign, traffic calming, and camera enforcement to keep trucks out of residential areas, but it stalled before any impact reached the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill cited the city’s reliance on trucks—89% of freight—fueling congestion, pollution, and risk for everyone outside a vehicle. The Council pointed to pilot programs like Blue Highways as a way to clear streets and cut emissions. But the resolution was filed without action.

The hearing, part of the state budget process, saw Lieber defend Governor Hochul’s proposed 5.5-percent fare increase as a return to regular hikes paused during the pandemic. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and colleagues pushed the 'Fix the MTA' package to freeze fares, boost service, and make buses free. Mamdani argued, 'It is simply not acceptable to put the cost of a basic public good on the backs of working class New Yorkers.' Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris criticized Lieber for insisting on fare hikes while dismissing other budget solutions. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas opposed making her constituents pay more. Lieber expressed concern about free buses, preferring targeted affordability programs. The hearing highlighted a sharp divide: lawmakers want to protect riders; the MTA wants stable funding. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
