The delay? “Not satisfactory,” electeds wrote earlier, warning that waiting “will unnecessarily put at risk” thousands walking and biking the cramped path. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-completes-long-stalled-plan-to-separate-bikes-and-pedestrians-on-queensboro-bridge>Gothamist</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h3 id=slow-them-down-or-count-the-dead>Slow them down or count the dead</h3><p>The state renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. Local reps backed it. The next step targets the worst repeaters. In Albany, Senator Michael Gianaris voted yes to move a speed‑limiter bill. Assembly Members Steven Raga and Claire Valdez co‑sponsor the Assembly version.

Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'No loss of life on our streets is acceptable.' The DOT has already added curb extensions and new crosswalks.

Critics say low fees fuel car ownership, crowding out transit, bikes, and green space. Experts warn it’s a subsidy for drivers, not a fix for congestion or emissions.</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2023, a Senate proposal surfaced to create a Residential Parking Permit system in New York City. The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident sparked a petition—over 26,000 signatures—calling for traffic lights to replace stop signs at three crossings. Gianaris pledged to 'make sure we fix Newtown Road where this happened, and to honor her father's request that there be traffic lights there.' The Department of Transportation upgraded crosswalk markings but has not committed to a traffic light, citing a low crash history. Residents and the victim’s family say the intersection remains dangerous, with drivers ignoring stop signs.

The stakes are high.</p><p class=mb3>On February 6, 2023, during a legislative hearing on MTA funding and fare policy, MTA Chair Janno Lieber testified that the agency needs $350 million more each year to prevent subway and bus fare hikes. The hearing, part of the state budget process, saw Lieber defend Governor Hochul’s proposed 5.5-percent fare increase as a return to regular hikes paused during the pandemic. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and colleagues pushed the 'Fix the MTA' package to freeze fares, boost service, and make buses free. Mamdani argued, 'It is simply not acceptable to put the cost of a basic public good on the backs of working class New Yorkers.' Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris criticized Lieber for insisting on fare hikes while dismissing other budget solutions. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas opposed making her constituents pay more. Lieber expressed concern about free buses, preferring targeted affordability programs. The hearing highlighted a sharp divide: lawmakers want to protect riders; the MTA wants stable funding. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
