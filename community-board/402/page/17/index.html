Since 2022, <strong>12 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,675 have been injured</strong> in crashes here. Thirty-five of those injuries were serious. These are not just numbers. They are bodies broken on Skillman Avenue, Roosevelt, and Queens Boulevard. They are children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. They are the sound of sirens at night and the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last year, a 16-year-old girl was killed at the intersection of 46th Street and 47th Avenue. The report lists her injury as &ldquo;crush injuries&rdquo; to the head. She died at the scene. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Officials said nothing</a>. Only the record of her death remains.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-vehicles-not-victims>The Pattern: Vehicles, Not Victims</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> They caused 4 deaths and 266 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses added 26 more injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, 16. Bikes, 14. The pattern is clear. The danger comes from mass and speed, not from those on foot or two wheels.</p><h2 id=local-leadership-progress-and-pressure>Local Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Michael Gianaris voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices, aiming to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>curb repeat dangerous driving</a>. Assembly Member Claire Valdez co-sponsored similar measures. Council Member Julie Won pushed for a citywide ban on parking near intersections, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>&ldquo;Daylighting saves lives&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow.

Every month, another family mourns.</strong></p><h2 id=the-voices-what-it-feels-like>The Voices: What It Feels Like</h2><p>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said Ken Baur</a> after a crash that injured eight. Another rider, Samantha Hart, said, &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>Hart told CBS New York</a>.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not fate.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand action against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They say MTA left Queens behind. Riders in transit deserts face long, costly trips. Lawmakers call the exclusion unacceptable. They want fair service before new fees begin.</p><p class=mb3>On May 16, 2024, ten Queens lawmakers, including Julia Salazar (District 18), urged the MTA to expand express bus service to Queens before the $15 Manhattan congestion toll starts. The group wrote to MTA chairman Janno Lieber, stating, "Express buses play a vital role in Queens’ public transit network and only stand to become even more pivotal in the near and distant future." They criticized the MTA for boosting express bus service in Brooklyn and Staten Island but not Queens, calling the exclusion "unacceptable." The lawmakers stressed that many southeast and northeast Queens residents lack subway access and rely on express buses to reach Midtown. They argued the 10 percent LIRR discount is no substitute for robust bus service. Salazar and her colleagues support congestion pricing but insist its success depends on expanded, equitable transit for all vulnerable riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot, which began in September 2023, made one bus in each borough free. Lawmakers, including Senator Michael Gianaris, pushed to expand it to 15 lines. The budget did not include this. Instead, $12.3 million was set aside to improve bus frequency, far short of the $45 million needed for expansion. The bill’s summary states, 'The MTA's experiment in fare-less city bus service will soon end after Albany lawmakers did not reauthorize it.' Gianaris pledged to keep fighting for affordable transit. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the pilot 'crucial' for working-class New Yorkers. The MTA’s Janno Lieber criticized the program. No safety analyst reviewed the impact on vulnerable road users.

The matter, described as 'lawlessness on the greenway,' has seen police ignore months of resident complaints. Won, through Chief of Staff Nick Gulotta, demanded the Parks Department install fencing and bollards to block cars. 'Council Member Won fully supports the call for the Parks Department to install fencing and bollards to prevent cars from illegally parking and driving through the Queensbridge Baby Park Greenway,' Gulotta said. The Parks Department claims to be working on a 'barricade plan' with NYCHA, but offers no timeline. The greenway, once a haven for pedestrians and cyclists, now serves as a parking lot. The NYPD and Parks Department pass blame. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.
