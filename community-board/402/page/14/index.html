Since 2022, <strong>12 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,675 have been injured</strong> in crashes here. Thirty-five of those injuries were serious. These are not just numbers. They are bodies broken on Skillman Avenue, Roosevelt, and Queens Boulevard. They are children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. They are the sound of sirens at night and the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last year, a 16-year-old girl was killed at the intersection of 46th Street and 47th Avenue. The report lists her injury as &ldquo;crush injuries&rdquo; to the head. She died at the scene. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Officials said nothing</a>. Only the record of her death remains.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-vehicles-not-victims>The Pattern: Vehicles, Not Victims</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> They caused 4 deaths and 266 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses added 26 more injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, 16. Bikes, 14. The pattern is clear. The danger comes from mass and speed, not from those on foot or two wheels.</p><h2 id=local-leadership-progress-and-pressure>Local Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Michael Gianaris voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices, aiming to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>curb repeat dangerous driving</a>. Assembly Member Claire Valdez co-sponsored similar measures. Council Member Julie Won pushed for a citywide ban on parking near intersections, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>&ldquo;Daylighting saves lives&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow.

Another rider, Samantha Hart, said, &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>Hart told CBS New York</a>.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not fate.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection.

The protest, organized by Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives, took place under the 7 train. Jaqi Cohen of Tri-State Transportation Campaign declared, “She can't ignore the needs of New York's eight million transit riders.” Restaurant owner Michael Fuquay said, “You want to know how my employees get to work? They walk, they bike, they take the bus.” State Assembly candidate Claire Valdez called the move “a slap in the face to millions who use public transit.” The MTA’s capital plan, including long-awaited elevator upgrades at 46 St-Bliss St and 33 St-Rawson, now hangs in the balance. Protesters condemned the governor’s action as a blow to vulnerable New Yorkers who depend on safe, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers float a $1 billion IOU for the MTA. No clear funding. Transit riders left in limbo. Streets stay clogged. Subways wait for repairs. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, state lawmakers, led by Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, responded to Governor Hochul’s sudden suspension of Manhattan’s congestion pricing plan. The Legislature rejected Hochul’s push for a payroll tax hike, then considered a vague $1 billion IOU for the MTA, with no funding source. Gianaris told reporters the proposal would simply promise a billion dollars for the next year’s budget, but offered no details. The bill has not been introduced or assigned to committee. Betsy Plum of the Riders Alliance warned, 'The proposal on the table will not fix the subway. A billion dollar IOU is not nearly enough money nor is it nearly secure enough to build trust and rebuild our critical infrastructure.' With no new revenue, the MTA’s ability to fund repairs and upgrades remains in doubt. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders—face continued danger as safe, reliable alternatives to driving are left unfunded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No replacement for the lost $1 billion. Transit riders and street users face uncertainty. Lawmakers call the move reckless. The city waits. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The future stays uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, Albany lawmakers responded to Governor Hochul’s cancellation of NYC congestion pricing. The proposed measure, still without a bill number or final language, would guarantee $1 billion annually for the MTA over 15 years. State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris explained, “It’s very simply something that just says there will be a billion dollars for the MTA in the following year’s budget, but without any specifics as to what that means.” Gianaris and others are working with Hochul and the MTA to keep capital projects alive. The bill’s fate is unclear, with some lawmakers already planning to vote no. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The measure’s details and its effect on street safety remain unknown.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Primary sponsor Sean Ryan, with co-sponsors Liz Krueger, Monica Martinez, Jack M. Martins, Anthony H. Palumbo, and Julia Salazar, pushed the measure. The bill mandates street designs that protect everyone, not just drivers. Most senators voted yes, but a block of no votes showed resistance. The bill’s language centers vulnerable users.
