Thirty-five left with serious injuries. Over 2,500 hurt.</strong> These are not distant tragedies. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last year alone, two more lives ended on these streets. Hundreds more were broken—<strong>732 injured, nine left with life-altering wounds</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The violence is relentless. A 16-year-old girl was killed crossing at 47th Avenue and 46th Street. A cyclist, 28, died under the wheels of a turning truck on Greenpoint Avenue. An 18-year-old moped rider lost his life on Laurel Hill Boulevard. The list goes on. Each crash a story cut short.</p><h3 id=speed-may-have-been-an-issue>&ldquo;Speed May Have Been an Issue&rdquo;</h3><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway, <strong>vaulted the divider, and slammed into oncoming cars</strong>. Six people were hurt, two left fighting for their lives. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>said speed may have been an issue</a>. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad closed the highway to pick through the wreckage.

She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame off pedestrians. But the pace is slow. The daylighting bill sits in committee. Promises pile up. Streets stay deadly.</p><p><strong>State Senator Michael Gianaris pushed for the Queensboro Bridge bike-pedestrian split.</strong> It took years. Each delay meant more close calls, more pain.

Call Senator Gianaris. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every intersection be daylighted. Demand action, not excuses. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Change is now law.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0708-2022, now Local Law 171 of 2023, was enacted by the City Council on December 16, 2023, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk.
