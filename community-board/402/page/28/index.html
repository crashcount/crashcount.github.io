Since 2022, <strong>12 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,675 have been injured</strong> in crashes here. Thirty-five of those injuries were serious. These are not just numbers. They are bodies broken on Skillman Avenue, Roosevelt, and Queens Boulevard. They are children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. They are the sound of sirens at night and the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last year, a 16-year-old girl was killed at the intersection of 46th Street and 47th Avenue. The report lists her injury as &ldquo;crush injuries&rdquo; to the head. She died at the scene. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Officials said nothing</a>. Only the record of her death remains.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-vehicles-not-victims>The Pattern: Vehicles, Not Victims</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> They caused 4 deaths and 266 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses added 26 more injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, 16. Bikes, 14. The pattern is clear. The danger comes from mass and speed, not from those on foot or two wheels.</p><h2 id=local-leadership-progress-and-pressure>Local Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Michael Gianaris voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices, aiming to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>curb repeat dangerous driving</a>. Assembly Member Claire Valdez co-sponsored similar measures. Council Member Julie Won pushed for a citywide ban on parking near intersections, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>&ldquo;Daylighting saves lives&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow.

Every month, another family mourns.</strong></p><h2 id=the-voices-what-it-feels-like>The Voices: What It Feels Like</h2><p>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said Ken Baur</a> after a crash that injured eight. Another rider, Samantha Hart, said, &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>Hart told CBS New York</a>.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not fate.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand action against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
