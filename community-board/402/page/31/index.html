The record shows “going straight ahead” and a “center front end” hit from an SUV. He never made it across. The data calls it “apparent death.” The driver kept going straight. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 16-year-old girl was killed at 47th Avenue and 46th Street.

The delay? “Not satisfactory,” electeds wrote earlier, warning that waiting “will unnecessarily put at risk” thousands walking and biking the cramped path. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-completes-long-stalled-plan-to-separate-bikes-and-pedestrians-on-queensboro-bridge>Gothamist</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h3 id=slow-them-down-or-count-the-dead>Slow them down or count the dead</h3><p>The state renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. Local reps backed it. The next step targets the worst repeaters. In Albany, Senator Michael Gianaris voted yes to move a speed‑limiter bill. Assembly Members Steven Raga and Claire Valdez co‑sponsor the Assembly version.
