State Senator Michael Gianaris backed the pilot, calling the cost manageable. Experts warn of service tradeoffs. The safety analyst notes: increased ridership signals a shift from cars, boosting safety for pedestrians and cyclists through safety in numbers and less vehicle traffic.

Fewer cars, safer streets for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2025, the Queens bus network redesign launched, marking the first major overhaul since the 1950s. The event, covered by AMNY, saw new routes and stops, including changes to the Q12 and Q13. Assembly Member Claire Valdez praised the redesign, calling buses a 'critical lifeline.' Transit advocates split: Riders Alliance applauded the move, while Passengers United warned of harm to vulnerable riders. A safety analyst noted, 'Bus network redesigns that improve transit access can encourage mode shift away from private vehicles, reducing traffic volumes and crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists while supporting street equity.' The redesign aims to shift trips from cars to buses, making streets less deadly for those outside vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, Bekim Fiseku, was wanted for burglary and had tape over his license plate. Police chased him nearly a mile through residential streets. A witness said, "She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force." The article highlights concerns about NYPD's pursuit tactics, quoting the victim's father: "It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood." Fiseku faces murder and manslaughter charges.
