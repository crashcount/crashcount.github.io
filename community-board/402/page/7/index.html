No arrests have been made,” police said. That was Queens too. A few miles from this district, same borough, same night air. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>NY Daily News</a>, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=the-bridge-finally-splits-walkers-and-bikes>The bridge finally splits walkers and bikes</h3><p>After years of delay, the city opened separate paths on the Queensboro Bridge. “After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [DOT] complete the work,” State Senator Michael Gianaris said. The delay? “Not satisfactory,” electeds wrote earlier, warning that waiting “will unnecessarily put at risk” thousands walking and biking the cramped path. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-completes-long-stalled-plan-to-separate-bikes-and-pedestrians-on-queensboro-bridge>Gothamist</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h3 id=slow-them-down-or-count-the-dead>Slow them down or count the dead</h3><p>The state renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. Local reps backed it. The next step targets the worst repeaters. In Albany, Senator Michael Gianaris voted yes to move a speed‑limiter bill. Assembly Members Steven Raga and Claire Valdez co‑sponsor the Assembly version. The proposal forces chronic violators to install devices that keep speed to the limit. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">Open States</a>.</p><p>At City Hall, the Council is pushing owner‑liability cameras for illegal parking that blocks sightlines and space people need to live.

Faster boarding slashes dwell times. Riders save time. Streets get safer, air gets cleaner. The city must weigh the cost—and the gains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2025, a policy analysis by Charles Komanoff examined the impact of fare-free buses in New York City. The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips. The report adds fuel to the debate over city funding for free bus service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
