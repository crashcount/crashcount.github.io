Thirty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,500 hurt since 2022. The youngest killed was sixteen. The oldest, seventy-five. A cyclist, a pedestrian, a child in a car—none spared. The names fade, but the pain stays. A bolt falls from the sky, glass explodes, and a man thinks he’s been shot. “It’s mind-boggling. I can’t believe that this has happened multiple times and it hasn’t been fixed yet,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/exclusive-debris-subway-tracks-shattered-mans-windshield-dented-car-queens/16217411/>said Rahimi</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, taxis, mopeds, bikes—they all draw blood, but the heaviest toll comes from the biggest machines. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans caused the most deaths and injuries to pedestrians. Children and elders are struck down. Cyclists are crushed by turning trucks. Riders are thrown from mopeds. The street is a gauntlet, not a promise.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p>The city touts Vision Zero. Speed cameras run all day now. The law says the speed limit can drop to 20 mph. But in Queens CB2, <strong>the carnage continues</strong>. Local leaders have not moved fast enough. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The city has the power to lower speeds, but waits. Each day of delay is another risk, another family broken.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can lower the speed limit. The council can demand more cameras, more street redesigns, more enforcement against reckless drivers. Residents can call, write, show up, and refuse to let the dead be forgotten.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bicyclist, traveling eastbound, was struck on the left side doors of the parked sedan, sustaining knee, lower leg, and foot injuries and was ejected from his bike. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor twice, indicating the sedan driver’s failure to maintain focus. The bicyclist was wearing a helmet but was also noted with a contributing factor of 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion.' The sedan was parked prior to impact, and the point of impact was the vehicle's left side doors. The driver was licensed and operating a 2021 Hyundai sedan.
