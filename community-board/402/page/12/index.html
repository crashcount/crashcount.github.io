A 28-year-old woman, thrown from her bike, killed by a turning truck. An 8-year-old, head bloodied, pulled from a wreck on the BQE.

The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The moped rider, a 50-year-old man, was thrown from his vehicle and suffered severe bleeding from the head, remaining conscious at the scene. The narrative describes blood pouring from his head onto the pavement. The SUV’s bumper was torn in the crash.

The pilot, which began in September 2023, made one bus in each borough free. Lawmakers, including Senator Michael Gianaris, pushed to expand it to 15 lines. The budget did not include this. Instead, $12.3 million was set aside to improve bus frequency, far short of the $45 million needed for expansion. The bill’s summary states, 'The MTA's experiment in fare-less city bus service will soon end after Albany lawmakers did not reauthorize it.' Gianaris pledged to keep fighting for affordable transit. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the pilot 'crucial' for working-class New Yorkers. The MTA’s Janno Lieber criticized the program. No safety analyst reviewed the impact on vulnerable road users.

The matter, titled 'Queens advocates demand action on greenway being slowly invaded by cars,' highlights years of drivers parking atop a car-free path. Won told Gothamist, 'It's unacceptable that cars park and drive illegally through the Queensbridge Baby Park Greenway, endangering our neighbors and treating this green space like a private parking lot.' She urged the Parks Department to install fencing and bollards and pressed the NYPD for regular enforcement. The Parks Department and NYCHA are working on a barricade plan but have not set a timeline. NYPD officers claim they cannot ticket cars due to insufficient signage. The city’s inaction leaves pedestrians and cyclists exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'lawlessness on the greenway,' has seen police ignore months of resident complaints. Won, through Chief of Staff Nick Gulotta, demanded the Parks Department install fencing and bollards to block cars. 'Council Member Won fully supports the call for the Parks Department to install fencing and bollards to prevent cars from illegally parking and driving through the Queensbridge Baby Park Greenway,' Gulotta said. The Parks Department claims to be working on a 'barricade plan' with NYCHA, but offers no timeline. The greenway, once a haven for pedestrians and cyclists, now serves as a parking lot. The NYPD and Parks Department pass blame. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.
