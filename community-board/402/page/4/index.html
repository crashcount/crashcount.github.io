Thirty-five left with serious injuries. Over 2,500 hurt.</strong> These are not distant tragedies. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last year alone, two more lives ended on these streets. Hundreds more were broken—<strong>732 injured, nine left with life-altering wounds</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The violence is relentless. A 16-year-old girl was killed crossing at 47th Avenue and 46th Street. A cyclist, 28, died under the wheels of a turning truck on Greenpoint Avenue. An 18-year-old moped rider lost his life on Laurel Hill Boulevard. The list goes on. Each crash a story cut short.</p><h3 id=speed-may-have-been-an-issue>&ldquo;Speed May Have Been an Issue&rdquo;</h3><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway, <strong>vaulted the divider, and slammed into oncoming cars</strong>. Six people were hurt, two left fighting for their lives. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>said speed may have been an issue</a>. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad closed the highway to pick through the wreckage.

She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame off pedestrians. But the pace is slow. The daylighting bill sits in committee. Promises pile up. Streets stay deadly.</p><p><strong>State Senator Michael Gianaris pushed for the Queensboro Bridge bike-pedestrian split.</strong> It took years. Each delay meant more close calls, more pain.

Call Senator Gianaris. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every intersection be daylighted. Demand action, not excuses. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report cites 'Pavement Defective' as the contributing factor, indicating road conditions played a critical role. The vehicle impacted with its left front bumper, sustaining damage in that area. The driver was properly restrained with a lap belt and harness and was not ejected from the vehicle. The report does not indicate any driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding, but highlights the defective pavement as the primary cause of the crash and injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous until cars yield space.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2025, Assemblyman Steven Raga proposed a bill to install 150 automated cameras across New York City. The measure, discussed in the council and supported by the NYC Department of Transportation, aims to ticket drivers who double park or block critical spaces. The bill summary states: 'Double parking and curb violations aren’t just a nuisance – they’re a public safety hazard.' Raga and DOT officials argue that manual enforcement cannot keep up with rising car numbers, leaving pedestrians and cyclists at risk. Raga led the push, highlighting blocked hydrants and crosswalks as threats. DOT said automated enforcement 'helps keep streets clear, reduces congestion, and protects New Yorkers.' Delivery drivers voiced concern about work impacts, but the bill’s focus remains on clearing space for vulnerable road users. The proposal awaits further council action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets choke with blocked bike lanes and chaos. Manual enforcement fails. DOT backs automation. Some lawmakers resist, call for cops. Vulnerable road users left dodging danger as debate drags.</p><p class=mb3>On March 3, 2025, a legislative proposal surfaced to deploy automated parking enforcement cameras across New York City. Assemblymember Steven Raga leads the push for a $35 million pilot, aiming to install 150 cameras targeting double parking and illegal stops. The bill, not yet assigned a committee or number, seeks to automate enforcement where manual efforts fall short. Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead. The Department of Transportation supports the expansion, stating, 'Automated enforcement has proven to change driver behavior and make our streets safer for everyone.' The debate centers on whether automation or police presence best protects pedestrians and cyclists from blocked lanes and traffic hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
