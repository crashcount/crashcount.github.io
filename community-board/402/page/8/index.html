A 28-year-old woman, thrown from her bike, killed by a turning truck. An 8-year-old, head bloodied, pulled from a wreck on the BQE.

The article, published October 28, 2024, details community outrage after a cyclist’s death and repeated injuries. NYPD policy says chases should end when risk outweighs reward, but enforcement fails. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. Comptroller Brad Lander says, 'Drivers who are repeatedly caught by speed and red-light cameras currently face no consequences other than a fine in the mail. Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.' State Senator Michael Gianaris calls for stronger penalties, including suspending registrations. The NYPD has not adopted reforms. Residents and advocates demand legislative action and transparency. Without it, vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the department of transportation posting information on traffic-control device and speed reducer requests on its website.” Council Member Kalman Yeger led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law orders DOT to publish every request for traffic signals and speed humps—case number, subject, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial, and timeline if approved. The public can now track what the city does, or fails to do, when streets need taming.

Both vehicles traveled east when the SUV struck the sedan’s center back end. The sedan’s driver and passenger suffered injuries, including a concussion and abrasions.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred at 21:05 on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. A 2021 Ford SUV, traveling east, collided with the center back end of a 2022 Honda sedan also traveling east. The report cites "Driver Inattention/Distraction" as a contributing factor for the SUV driver. The sedan’s driver, a 52-year-old male, sustained abrasions to his elbow, lower arm, and hand but was conscious and wearing a lap belt and harness. The sedan’s passenger, a 24-year-old male, suffered a concussion and head injury; he was also conscious and restrained. The passenger’s injuries were compounded by the SUV driver’s failure to maintain a safe following distance, noted as "Following Too Closely." Neither occupant was ejected. The collision highlights the dangers of driver distraction and tailgating on high-speed roadways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The pause threatens subway and bus service. Advocates demand any replacement funds boost operations, not highways. Riders need frequent, affordable transit—not more gridlock and pollution.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published October 1, 2024, addresses Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing and seek alternative funding for the MTA’s $15-billion capital plan. The article states: “If the governor wants to do the MTA and riders a favor, she should use the money she finds to instead boost MTA operations.” Author Samuel Santaella criticizes Hochul’s move, arguing it jeopardizes service for working-class New Yorkers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris are cited as proponents of fare-free buses, while Riders Alliance pushes for six-minute service. The piece urges Hochul to reject highway expansions and instead invest in frequent, affordable transit. The editorial frames this as a fight for clean air, equity, and safety for all New Yorkers who rely on public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
