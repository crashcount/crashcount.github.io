Since 2022, <strong>12 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,675 have been injured</strong> in crashes here. Thirty-five of those injuries were serious. These are not just numbers. They are bodies broken on Skillman Avenue, Roosevelt, and Queens Boulevard. They are children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. They are the sound of sirens at night and the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last year, a 16-year-old girl was killed at the intersection of 46th Street and 47th Avenue. The report lists her injury as &ldquo;crush injuries&rdquo; to the head. She died at the scene. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Officials said nothing</a>. Only the record of her death remains.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-vehicles-not-victims>The Pattern: Vehicles, Not Victims</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> They caused 4 deaths and 266 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses added 26 more injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, 16. Bikes, 14. The pattern is clear. The danger comes from mass and speed, not from those on foot or two wheels.</p><h2 id=local-leadership-progress-and-pressure>Local Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Michael Gianaris voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices, aiming to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>curb repeat dangerous driving</a>. Assembly Member Claire Valdez co-sponsored similar measures. Council Member Julie Won pushed for a citywide ban on parking near intersections, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/06/daylight-again-council-seeks-universal-parking-ban-at-intersections>&ldquo;Daylighting saves lives&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow.

Every month, another family mourns.</strong></p><h2 id=the-voices-what-it-feels-like>The Voices: What It Feels Like</h2><p>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said Ken Baur</a> after a crash that injured eight. Another rider, Samantha Hart, said, &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>Hart told CBS New York</a>.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not fate.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand action against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area.

The discussion, reported by nydailynews.com, centered on Valdez's support for measures like a Vehicle-miles Traveled fee and charging for on-street parking. The article quotes, 'Her op-ed is filled with proposals/ideas for how to make drivers pay for subway improvements.' Letters from readers, including Thomas Murawski and Thomas Bower, accused Valdez of unfairly targeting drivers and ignoring the needs of workers without transit options. Valdez was mentioned, not directly quoted, in the backlash. No formal council bill or vote was involved.

The city must weigh the cost—and the gains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2025, a policy analysis by Charles Komanoff examined the impact of fare-free buses in New York City. The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips. The report adds fuel to the debate over city funding for free bus service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, covered by Streetsblog, found that eliminating fares would speed up bus trips by 12 percent and increase annual ridership by 169 million—up 20 percent. The report states: "Fare-free buses would juice bus speeds and ridership while also bringing economic benefits to bus riders themselves." State Senator Michael Gianaris, representing District 12, is mentioned as a supporter. The analysis, led by Charles Komanoff, shows that removing fares slashes dwell times and makes service faster and more reliable. While the shift from cars to buses is modest, the benefits for bus riders are clear: less waiting, more access, and safer streets.

The bill's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...in relation to tracking progress made towards the requirements of the streets master plan.' Council Member Julie Won led sponsorship, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Ayala, and others. The law demands DOT post annual and monthly updates on every project tied to the master plan—listing details, timelines, funding, and setbacks. This law brings sunlight to street safety work, making the city answer for every mile and missed deadline.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project sits finished. Cyclists and walkers still cram into a narrow, crash-prone lane. Delays keep thousands at risk. City Hall stalls. Advocates plan protest. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
