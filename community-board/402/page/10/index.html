The pedestrian sustained neck contusions and was conscious at the scene. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors to the crash. The truck's point of impact was the center front end, and notably, the vehicle sustained no damage. The pedestrian was not at fault; the driver’s failure to yield and distraction directly led to the injury.

Two parked vehicles—a taxi and an SUV—collided head-on. The report states a 29-year-old male driver was pinned inside, suffering a broken neck and crush injuries, though he remained conscious. Police cite 'Turning Improperly' as the primary contributing factor. The narrative describes metal groaning and the wrong turn that led to the crash. Both vehicles sustained heavy front-end damage. The police report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the improper turn that set the stage for this devastating impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
