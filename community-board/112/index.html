Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, Mayor Adams announced the removal of the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn. The lane, installed in 2024, calmed a corridor once plagued by crashes and deaths. Streetsblog NYC reported: 'A protected bike lane that was installed last year to calm a notoriously dangerous Brooklyn corridor will be removed by the Adams administration, making the roadway less safe.' Council Members Lincoln Restler and Chi Ossé condemned the move, calling it reckless and political. Brad Lander and Zohran Mamdani joined in opposition. No council bill or committee review occurred; this was a unilateral mayoral action. Removing the lane eliminates a proven safety intervention, increasing risk for cyclists and pedestrians and discouraging active transportation, which undermines safety in numbers and equitable street access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Systemic danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the Adams administration launched the NYC e-bike trade-in program. No bill number or committee is listed, but the $2-million program stems from a 2023 bill by Council Member Keith Powers. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'The Adams administration is both cracking down on e-bikes and providing safer e-bikes to workers.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'This is not just about protecting delivery workers. It’s about protecting them, their families, their neighbors, and all New Yorkers from deadly fires.' Delivery worker William Medina praised the program, but called for expansion. The program lets workers trade uncertified bikes or illegal mopeds for certified e-bikes, but covers only a fraction of the city’s 80,000 delivery workers. The safety analyst notes: Cracking down may burden vulnerable users, while safer bikes help; mixed signals mean no clear safety gain. The city’s approach leaves vulnerable road users in limbo.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, detailed by Streetsblog NYC, 'features mini-protected bike lanes at corners, aiming to improve safety by "daylighting" intersections—removing parked cars to increase visibility.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Advocates Jon Orcutt and Jackson Chabot praised the use of real infrastructure but called for faster rollout. DOT opposes a Council bill for universal daylighting without hard barriers, warning it could make turns more dangerous. Safety analysts note: daylighting and targeted cycling infrastructure cut crashes and protect vulnerable road users citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No council bill number or committee is attached; this is a direct DOT action. Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The plan uses hardened daylighting—barriers, granite blocks, planters—to keep cars away from corners. Each site will get a tailored design, focusing on visibility and reducing conflicts, especially where trucks turn. A safety analyst notes: redesigning high-traffic intersections to improve visibility addresses systemic risk factors and is likely to reduce conflicts and crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists, supporting safer mode shift and street equity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."
