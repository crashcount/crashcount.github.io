The article quotes the sign: "Another horse dead. Please don't ride." and PETA spokesperson Ashley Byrne: "How many overworked horses need to suffer and drop dead on the streets of New York before this shameful cruelty is banned?" It cites preliminary necropsy findings of an aortic rupture tied to a tumor. The piece frames clear policy fallout: renewed calls for 'Ryder's Law' to ban carriage horses, Conservancy warnings about public safety and park damage, and complaints that drivers do not always clean up waste.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact left one car's right rear bumper and the other's front end damaged.
