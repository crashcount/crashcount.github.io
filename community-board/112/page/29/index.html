Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Riders now move straighter, faster, safer. Crosswalks grew. Concrete replaced chaos. Thousands of Bronx commuters feel the change underfoot and in the ride.</p><p class=mb3>On January 24, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced sidewalk expansion and new contraflow bus lanes at Pelham Bay Park station in the East Bronx. The project, begun in September 2021 and finished last fall, added 1,285 square feet of sidewalk, a new median, and red bus-only lanes on Westchester Avenue. The DOT worked with the MTA to cut a circuitous bus detour, giving Bx12 and other riders a direct path. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'DOT’s work at Pelham Bay Park... may be only one-10th of a mile, but the impact for thousands of riders will be gigantic.' New York City Transit President Richard Davey added, 'Bus lanes don't have to be miles long to deliver a huge impact.' The changes serve 64,000 daily riders, expanding space for pedestrians and shortening bus trips. More crosswalks now connect the busy transfer point, making the area less hostile for those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) will supply Vision Zero helmets to recipients. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez praised cycling’s power to connect working-class communities and boost life expectancy, saying, "It's about increasing life expectancy, and it's about connecting the working class community." Bike New York CEO Ken Podziba called the program "a transformational power of cycling" to help immigrants acclimate and thrive. The effort responds to the isolation and transportation barriers faced by asylum seekers. Bike donations are accepted at locations in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn. No formal council bill or vote is attached to this announcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The numbers show progress.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC’s 'Streetsies 2022' roundup, published December 27, 2022, highlights major NYC DOT projects that reshaped city streets. The article celebrates a 7% drop in traffic fatalities and fewer pedestrian deaths, crediting street redesigns. Projects include 24-7-365 speed cameras, Paseo Park’s permanent open street, Schermerhorn Street’s two-way protected bike lane, Fifth Avenue’s car-free Sundays, Apolline’s Garden intersection redesign, and Emmons Avenue’s new bike lane. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pushed for speed cameras everywhere crashes happen, stating, 'we should have speed cameras everywhere there are crashes.' Despite some local resistance, the city removed parking and created public space, especially after fatal crashes. These changes, backed by council support and public demand, show clear safety gains for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
