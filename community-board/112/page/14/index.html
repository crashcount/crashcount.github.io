Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, not tied to a specific bill number, is led by the Department of Transportation and replaces a traffic lane in each direction between West End Avenue and 2nd Avenue. The matter aims to 'speed up crosstown buses like the M96 and M106.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, has sided with residents opposing the change, though she did not comment for the record. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the new lane will make commutes 'faster, more reliable, and safer for everyone.' The bus lane will operate 24/7, except for a short eastbound stretch. DOT notes that 74% of 96th Street residents do not own cars, and most commute by transit, bike, or foot. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'DOT begins construction of new bus lanes along Manhattan’s 96th Street,' aims to improve service for 15,500 weekday riders. Councilmember Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, held a rally earlier in the month expressing concerns about lost curb space and pushed for alternative solutions. Brewer sent a letter to DOT on behalf of residents, stating, 'All I can say is that I did what I did to represent them.' DOT officials countered that the redesign will reduce congestion and retain curb access. The project includes dedicated bus lanes, left-turn bays, and treatments to slow drivers. Most residents in the area rely on transit, walking, or cycling. The city expects the redesign to make commutes faster and safer for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT stays silent.</p><p class=mb3>On September 17, 2024, Streetsblog filed a lawsuit against the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT), alleging systematic violations of the state’s Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). The suit, brought with the Cornell Law School First Amendment Clinic, targets DOT’s practice of imposing uniform six-month delays on nearly all journalist information requests. Streetsblog’s complaint states: “DOT consistently violates the state's Freedom of Information Law by delaying for six months nearly all of the requests for public information from journalists.” The delays affect at least 33 Streetsblog requests since June 2021, including data on pedestrian fatalities and DOT project records. Michael Martin Linhorst, Streetsblog’s attorney, aims to set a precedent to end these blanket delays. DOT declined to comment. The case highlights how bureaucratic stonewalling keeps critical safety data from the public, undermining transparency and accountability for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the driver was inattentive and distracted, and also cites 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor. The narrative confirms the driver 'didn’t see him.' The pedestrian remained conscious after the collision. The police report makes no mention of any pedestrian error or unsafe behavior, emphasizing instead the role of driver inattention and speed.

The project, supported by Councilmember Carmen De La Rosa (District 10), was announced by the NYC Department of Transportation. The matter summary states, 'The improvements... aim to enhance safety for pedestrians and cyclists and provide faster bus service.' De La Rosa, who represents the area, said, 'I've never been so afraid to walk a bridge on foot... it was an accident waiting to happen.' The overhaul separates cyclists and pedestrians from cars with jersey barriers and fences, and adds protected pedestrian paths. Automated cameras will enforce the bus lane. The DOT plans further safety measures, including a leading pedestrian interval at crossings. These changes target long-standing dangers for vulnerable road users on the bridge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation seeks a contractor to install technology that fines drivers who pass stopped buses. The state legalized these cameras in 2019. The City Council, led by then-Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez, passed a law in early 2022 for a six-month pilot and required annual reporting. The city enacted automated fine rules in November. Advocates, including Transportation Alternatives, praised the move: 'We know changes like this can save lives.' Suffolk County saw a 42-percent drop in violations after similar cameras. The Adams administration questioned the program's impact, noting no deaths from bus arm violations since 2014. The city has not published pilot results. The state law enabling cameras runs through 2029.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of advocacy and delay. The DOT will convert a painted, often-blocked bike lane between Dean Street and Flushing Avenue into a protected corridor. The official summary states: 'The addition of a parking-protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue will create a critical cycling link...while making the road safer for everyone.' Ossé, who previously criticized DOT delays, said, 'This project is a win for everyone.' The lane will address a Vision Zero Priority Corridor with five pedestrian deaths and nearly 400 crashes since 2019. New medians, pedestrian islands, and traffic-calming measures will target deadly intersections. Advocates call it critical safety infrastructure, the first of its kind in the district.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.
