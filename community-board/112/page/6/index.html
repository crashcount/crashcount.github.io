Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The policy aims to move mopeds out of bike lanes and onto motor vehicle lanes, addressing hazardous mixing of modes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “This proposed rule change is about expanding safe, practical options for moped users.” The change responds to rising moped use, especially among delivery workers, and ongoing conflicts with cyclists and pedestrians. Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York support removing mopeds from bikeways but urge DOT to do more for moped safety. The DOT will not lower speed limits as part of the policy. Mopeds remain banned from the Queensboro’s upper roadway. A public hearing is scheduled for April 14. The city recorded 1,496 injury-causing moped crashes in 2024, with only one on an East River Bridge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden supports both city and state versions, stating, 'We need the state DMV to issue license plates for e-bikes.'

The speed still echoed in the wreckage.' The data shows both drivers were licensed and neither occupant was ejected.

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the city, 'Weigh-in-Motion technology has successfully eliminated 60% of the overweight truck traffic on the Queens bound BQE.' Restler said he hopes for similar results on the Staten Island-bound lanes. The bill authorizing the program is set to expire, prompting calls for urgent legislative action. Rodriguez called the technology a 'national model.' Lawmakers want to expand the system to other sites, including the Washington Bridge.

Menin wrote to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, demanding answers and citing a lack of community input. Residents and drivers complained the change slowed cars and let e-bikes speed unchecked.

The crash occurred as the sedan’s right side door was opened directly into the cyclist’s path. The report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The cyclist, a 25-year-old man, was conscious but bleeding heavily from his arm. The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s errors. The sedan was stationary, and its right rear quarter panel was damaged. The incident underscores the danger posed when drivers or passengers open doors without checking for oncoming cyclists, as detailed in the police narrative: 'No warning. Just metal, motion, and the sound of pain on pavement.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Streets stripped bare by fresh asphalt must get lines back fast. Delays require public notice. The law aims to keep crosswalks and lanes visible, protecting walkers and riders.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1160-2025, now enacted, came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced January 8, 2025, passed March 15, and became Local Law 28 of 2025. The bill's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing pavement markings.' Council Member Farah N. Louis led as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Schulman, Banks, Farías, Carr, and Ariola. The law orders DOT to install pavement or temporary markings within five business days after any street resurfacing. If DOT misses the deadline, it must post notices explaining the delay and set a new timeline. DOT must also report yearly on compliance. The law responds to a simple fact: missing markings mean danger for people on foot and bike. With this law, the city moves to close that deadly gap.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
