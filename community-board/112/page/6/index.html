Two people died. Seven hundred were hurt. Fourteen suffered injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting in hospital halls.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit her, and ran. The police checked the victim, then left. The car was abandoned. The driver vanished. A neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> The street is a gauntlet. The pain is routine.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill>Patterns That Kill</h2><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> It is built into the streets. In the last year, people ages 18 to 34 bore the brunt: over 300 injuries, two deaths. Children and elders are not spared. The most common killers are cars and SUVs, responsible for three deaths and 14 serious injuries in the last three years. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes have left their own scars, but the weight of harm comes from the largest machines.</p><p>The cycle repeats. A man is hit. A woman is left bleeding. A child is struck. The city moves on. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem,&rdquo;</a> said a man named Jordan. The intersection stays the same.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Robert Jackson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. Assembly Member Manny De Los Santos <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored</a> the same. Both voted to extend the city’s speed camera program, a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The streets are still built for speed, not safety. The dead cannot call for change. The living must.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that protect people, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Fewer cars, slower speeds, safer lives.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2025, the Department of Transportation announced a proposal for center-running bus lanes on Flatbush Avenue, from Downtown Brooklyn to Grand Army Plaza. The plan, reported by BKReader, is not tied to a council bill or committee yet. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn’t work for anyone: almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' The proposal includes new pedestrian spaces, concrete bus boarding islands, and adjusted curb regulations for deliveries. A safety analyst notes: 'Dedicated bus lanes can reduce car traffic and speeds, improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists while supporting mode shift away from private vehicles.' The city will seek public input before finalizing plans.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Two car lanes will vanish. Boarding islands rise for passengers. Benches and canopies come. Traffic slows. Buses speed up. Fewer cars, more space for people. Danger drops for walkers and riders.</p><p class=mb3>On June 5, 2025, the NYC Department of Transportation unveiled a redesign for Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The plan, selected from three options, creates center-running bus lanes from Livingston Street to Grand Army Plaza. The matter title: 'Busy Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn would get new bus lanes under DOT redesign plan.' Council Member Barbara Russo-Lennon supports the redesign. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the proposal would create a welcoming corridor for all. Demetrius Crichlow of NYC Transit backed the plan, citing faster commutes. The redesign removes two car lanes, adds boarding islands, benches, and canopies. According to safety analysts, center-running bus lanes cut conflicts at the curb, calm traffic, and boost safety and comfort for vulnerable road users—pedestrians and cyclists. The plan now heads to community boards for review and input.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No bill number or committee was cited. The matter: 'The Bedford Avenue protected bike lane is facing opposition from key figures in the Brooklyn Democratic machine.' Council Members Lincoln Restler and Chi Oss support the lane. Former Adams chief of staff Frank Carone and Brooklyn party chair Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn lead the opposition. Mayor Eric Adams calls for listening to bike lane critics. Challenger Sabrina Gates wants the lane rerouted. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defends the lane’s safety record. A safety analyst warns: 'Threats to protected bike lanes undermine safe infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, potentially reducing mode shift and safety in numbers while increasing risk for vulnerable road users.' The fight is not just political. It is life and death for those outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and pedestrians reclaim space. DOT shifts mopeds to roadways. Rule aims to cut conflict and danger. Safety improves for vulnerable users. Change takes effect June 26.</p><p class=mb3>On May 27, 2025, the city adopted a new rule allowing mopeds on the lower roadway of the Queensboro Bridge and on the Brooklyn Bridge, removing them from bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "This rule change expands safe and practical travel options for moped riders—particularly the thousands of delivery workers and commuters who depend on them every day, while also enhancing safety for pedestrians and cyclists by reducing conflicts on shared crossings." The rule takes effect June 26. The move follows years of complaints about mopeds crowding bike lanes and endangering cyclists and pedestrians. Streetsblog NYC reported the change, noting that previous city law forced mopeds into bike lanes, creating hazardous conditions. Removing mopeds from bike lanes reduces conflicts and speeds in spaces intended for vulnerable users, improving safety and comfort for pedestrians and cyclists and supporting mode shift.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
