Two people died. Seven hundred were hurt. Fourteen suffered injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting in hospital halls.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit her, and ran. The police checked the victim, then left. The car was abandoned. The driver vanished. A neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> The street is a gauntlet. The pain is routine.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill>Patterns That Kill</h2><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> It is built into the streets. In the last year, people ages 18 to 34 bore the brunt: over 300 injuries, two deaths. Children and elders are not spared. The most common killers are cars and SUVs, responsible for three deaths and 14 serious injuries in the last three years. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes have left their own scars, but the weight of harm comes from the largest machines.</p><p>The cycle repeats. A man is hit. A woman is left bleeding. A child is struck. The city moves on. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem,&rdquo;</a> said a man named Jordan. The intersection stays the same.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Robert Jackson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. Assembly Member Manny De Los Santos <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored</a> the same. Both voted to extend the city’s speed camera program, a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The streets are still built for speed, not safety. The dead cannot call for change. The living must.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that protect people, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws.

The fight over who belongs on city roads rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On March 27, 2025, mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo supported a Republican-backed proposal to require registration and license plates for all e-bikes in New York City. The plan, not yet introduced as a formal bill, would cost $20 million, according to the Department of Transportation. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from e-bike users, advocates, and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The matter centers on Cuomo's claim that registration will address 'chaos and promote safety.' Critics, including Queens cycling advocate Jim Burke and safe streets organizer Noel Hidalgo, argue the measure 'demonizes' e-bike users and ignores the real danger: reckless driving by motorists. Advocates say the plan would harm families, seniors, and delivery workers who rely on e-bikes, especially in transit deserts. They urge lawmakers to focus on street design and car enforcement, not new restrictions.

At a community meeting, Brooks-Powers said, "We’ve been trying to get [the bike lane] removed for three years. It wasn’t supported by the community. ... In effect it’s not a bike lane quite honestly; no one uses it, they [drivers] park there. We would like to see the hard infrastructure removed." Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that building safe bike lanes requires support from local leaders. DOT spokesperson Will Livingston said the agency remains committed to safety and will explore hardening the lane and increasing enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers (District 31) joined transportation advocates in calling for increased funding and staffing for the Department of Transportation (DOT). The push, highlighted in a letter to city officials, urges an end to the DOT hiring freeze and more resources for street safety projects. The letter states: 'With sufficient staffing and funding, DOT could help New York City improve street safety, reduce car dependency, meet our climate goals, and bring reliable transit service to more neighborhoods.' Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives testified at a council hearing, warning, 'An underfunded DOT doesn’t just mean more dangerous streets—it also means a less liveable, vibrant, and thriving city.' Brooks-Powers and advocates argue that without more staff and money, life-saving projects like Open Streets will not expand. The city’s budget, they say, is a statement of values—and right now, it leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
