Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>On November 10, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation proposed making Grand Army Plaza car-free and connecting it to Open Streets on Vanderbilt and Underhill Avenues. The matter, described as 'NYC DOT proposal for car-free Grand Army Plaza and related street safety improvements,' is not a formal council bill but has drawn council attention. Council Member Shahana Hanif (District 39) and Crystal Hudson pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to address the plaza’s 'endless traffic, poor sidewalk conditions, broken benches, and overflowing trash cans.' Hanif and Hudson demanded immediate safety upgrades after recent crashes injured pedestrians and cyclists. DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton said, 'We want to take it to the next level... more consistent and better designed public spaces.' The agency is seeking public feedback and plans to draft detailed designs within the year. The proposal aims to end the status quo of danger and disrepair, prioritizing vulnerable road users over cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The report states, 'business is booming along streets converted to outdoor dining strips or car-free open streets.' Rodriguez supports curbside dining, declaring, 'the future of New York City is going car free.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams disagrees, saying outdoor dining should stay on the sidewalk. Mayor Adams promises to keep the program as a 'critical driver of recovery.' The report found more business growth on open streets than on similar corridors, with gains in Astoria, Prospect Heights, and Chinatown.

He passed too close, failed to yield, and faced no charges. The city lacks a three-foot passing law. A 2019 bill to fix this died in committee. Cyclists remain exposed. Justice denied.</p><p class=mb3>In 2019, then-Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez introduced a bill requiring drivers to keep a minimum three-foot distance when overtaking cyclists. The bill, supported by NYPD and DOT, never reached a vote before Rodriguez’s term ended and has not been reassigned. The bill summary states it 'would require drivers of motor vehicles to maintain a minimum distance of three feet when overtaking a bicycle.' Rodriguez sponsored the bill. Legal experts Daniel Flanzig and Steve Vaccaro criticized the lack of enforcement and the absence of a defined safe passing law, noting that most of the country already has such protections. Flanzig called the law essential to prevent tragedies like the death of Kala Santiago, who was killed by a truck driver on Parkside Avenue. Without this law, cyclists remain at risk, and drivers rarely face consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
