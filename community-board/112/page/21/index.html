Two people died. Seven hundred were hurt. Fourteen suffered injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting in hospital halls.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit her, and ran. The police checked the victim, then left. The car was abandoned. The driver vanished. A neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> The street is a gauntlet. The pain is routine.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill>Patterns That Kill</h2><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> It is built into the streets. In the last year, people ages 18 to 34 bore the brunt: over 300 injuries, two deaths. Children and elders are not spared. The most common killers are cars and SUVs, responsible for three deaths and 14 serious injuries in the last three years. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes have left their own scars, but the weight of harm comes from the largest machines.</p><p>The cycle repeats. A man is hit. A woman is left bleeding. A child is struck. The city moves on. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem,&rdquo;</a> said a man named Jordan. The intersection stays the same.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Robert Jackson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. Assembly Member Manny De Los Santos <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored</a> the same. Both voted to extend the city’s speed camera program, a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The streets are still built for speed, not safety. The dead cannot call for change. The living must.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that protect people, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, developed over two years, promised to 'remove a lane of car traffic in each direction, add protected bike lanes, and shorten pedestrian crossings.' Mayor Eric Adams ordered DOT to scale it back after opposition, leaving only partial improvements. Restler accused the mayor of ignoring traffic experts and thousands of residents. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams called the city’s response 'unacceptable' and 'irresponsible.' The Department of Transportation resumed limited work but has not finished its analysis for the southern half. Residents and advocates, including Make McGuinness Safe, cite ongoing crashes and dangerous crossings. The city’s compromise leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as the most effective safety measures remain unbuilt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Paladino criticized DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and street safety advocates, calling for a 'robust, inclusive debate.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's failure to meet the 2019 NYC Streets Plan, which mandates 50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. The city has built only 72% of required bike lanes and 19% of bus lanes. Advocates point to rising deaths, especially among children, and blame delays and opposition from local officials.

Kathy Hochul publicly supported reauthorizing New York City’s red light camera program, which is set to expire in December. The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, would renew the program for six years and expand cameras from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Hochul, at a ceremony for 'Sammy’s Law,' said, 'local governments should be making these decisions,' but did not endorse the expansion. The Adams administration and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez have pushed for more cameras. Hochul’s stance signals support for local control over traffic enforcement, but leaves the fate of a broader camera rollout uncertain. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while Albany debates the city’s authority to protect its streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Beaton testified, 'Half of our vehicles are stored on the street overnight.' The Adams administration aims to install up to 10,000 curbside chargers over the next decade. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized DOT for failing to meet bus and bike lane expansion mandates. Sara Lind of Open Plans countered, 'DOT and the administration are fully capable of changing the status quo and rethinking curb parking.' Advocates warned that more EV chargers could block future sidewalk, bike lane, or outdoor dining expansions.

Their letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez urges the city to connect the missing stretch between Canal Street and West 8th Street, a span where cyclists must ride in open traffic. The letter states, 'The Department of Transportation should prioritize a new bike lane at this location, which has been a long standing request of the community.' Bottcher, representing District 3, said, 'You know you're going to be in danger, because you're going to have to be riding in the same lane as speeding traffic, cars and trucks.' DOT spokesperson Nick Benson acknowledged support for the expansion but gave no timeline.

Cunningham, who sponsors the bill, said, 'Dirty streets are totally unacceptable.' Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch supports the change, noting that state law must allow automated ticketing.

The official summary states the goal is to 'reduce peak-hour deliveries, aiming to decrease congestion and improve safety.' Rodriguez said, 'This incentive program will support local businesses and benefit all New Yorkers by reducing the number of delivery trucks on our roads during busy daytime hours.' Levine called it a move to prioritize 'safety, sustainability, and efficiency.' The plan targets small businesses, often unable to afford overnight staffing.
