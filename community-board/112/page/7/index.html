Twelve dead. Thirty-eight left with serious wounds since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped on Saint Nicholas Avenue, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, a woman burned alive in a car on 10th Avenue. The living carry scars, broken bones, and memories that do not heal.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did the most harm. They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or serious injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes—none are blameless, but the weight of steel and speed falls hardest from behind the wheel of a car.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-sound-of-sirens>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Sound of Sirens</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The mayor says, “One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many” <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/nyregion/bronx-nypd-car-chase-fatal-fire.html>said Mayor Adams</a>. But the streets do not listen to words. In April, two NYPD officers chased a stolen car into Inwood. The car crashed and burned. The officers left the scene. The man inside died alone. The NYPD suspended the officers and launched an investigation. Commissioner Tisch said, “The NYPD’s enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk, and pursuits for violations and low-level crimes can be both potentially dangerous and unnecessary” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/03/us-news/2-nypd-cops-drive-off-after-bronx-to-manhattan-chase-of-stolen-car-car-ends-in-deadly-crash-sources/>Commissioner Tisch, NY Post</a>.</p><p>The city has added protected bike lanes and lowered speed limits in some places. But the pace is slow. The deaths do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every delay is a choice. Every injury is a warning. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can redesign streets, install more cameras, and hold reckless drivers to account. But it will not act unless you force it to.</p><p>Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood on the street is not an accident.

Metal, flesh, and asphalt collided in daylight.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a Jeep traveling south on Harlem River Drive collided with a motorcycle, sending its 50-year-old rider flying onto the pavement. The report states, 'A Jeep slammed into a motorcycle, hurling its 50-year-old rider onto the hot pavement. His arm shattered. His skin burned. The bike overturned.' The motorcyclist suffered severe burns and a broken upper arm. The crash also involved a sedan, which sustained damage to its rear bumper. The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor, underscoring the role of excessive speed in the collision. The motorcyclist was ejected and injured, but the report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.
