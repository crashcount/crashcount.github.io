Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with key votes on February 13, 2025. The law, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring street resurfacing coordination,' requires the Department of Transportation to coordinate with agencies and utilities and finish resurfacing within 15 business days after milling. If DOT cannot meet the deadline, it must post a public notice and alert the community board. Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The measure responds to the hazard of prolonged, uneven streets, which put pedestrians, cyclists, and people with mobility devices at risk. The law’s timeline and notice rules take effect in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate follows congestion pricing, which, as the bill summary states, has made free street parking uptown scarce and pushed more drivers into residential neighborhoods. State Senator Robert Jackson sponsors a parallel bill in Albany. De La Rosa and Jackson argue that local residents lose parking to out-of-state drivers. Councilmember Gale Brewer warns that low permit prices could increase car ownership and worsen parking shortages, citing past failures in other cities. Kate Slevin of the Regional Plan Association questions whether a permit system would be enforced, given the city's history of placard abuse. The bill's impact on vulnerable road users remains unaddressed.

The e-scooter driver, who was unlicensed, sustained abrasions to his elbow and lower arm and remained conscious after the collision. The report cites two primary driver errors: unsafe speed by the e-scooter operator and pedestrian/bicyclist confusion contributing to the crash. The sedan driver was licensed and operating a 2021 Toyota sedan. The point of impact on the sedan was the left front bumper. The collision underscores the dangers posed by unlicensed operation and unsafe speed, compounded by confusion in vulnerable road user behavior, without assigning fault to the injured e-scooter rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The program, covering 750 school zones, needs state approval before June. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls speed cameras 'one of the most effective tools' to stop deadly driving. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who sponsored the last reauthorization, says, 'my bill to expand the speed camera program has saved lives.' The city wants stronger penalties for repeat offenders and action on license plate fraud, which lets millions of violations go unpunished. The report shows cameras cut speeding by 94 percent and reduce injuries and deaths. The program faces political hurdles, but the evidence is clear: speed cameras protect people on foot and bike.

The pedestrian sustained serious injuries to her knee, lower leg, and foot, including fractures and dislocations. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor to the crash. The vehicle showed no damage, indicating the impact was likely to the pedestrian rather than the car. No other contributing factors related to the pedestrian’s behavior were noted. This collision highlights the dangers posed by distracted driving in urban intersections, where pedestrians legally crossing remain vulnerable to inattentive motorists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Assembly bill A 2299 targets repeat violators. The law would require intelligent speed assistance devices. The goal: stop reckless drivers before they kill.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A 2299, now in sponsorship, sits with the New York State Assembly. Introduced January 17, 2025, it awaits committee review. The bill summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, and others. No votes have been recorded yet. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving by forcing speed limiters on offenders. This targets a core threat to pedestrians and cyclists: unchecked speed and repeat lawbreaking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Granite blocks, bike racks, and barriers will guard corners. Most pedestrian deaths happen at intersections. The city has ignored its own parking ban. Activists demand real change. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On January 17, 2025, Mayor Eric Adams proposed a budget boost to $3.85 million per year for 'hardened daylighting' at intersections. The plan, detailed by City Hall's Office of Management and Budget, aims to install granite blocks, bike racks, and other barriers at hundreds of corners. Adams said, 'We are ... keeping New Yorkers safe on our streets ... by improving road safety at hundreds of targeted traffic intersections.' State law bans parking within 20 feet of intersections, but New York City exempts itself, fueling deadly crashes—55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries happen at intersections. Council members and grassroots activists are pushing to end the city's carveout and require the Department of Transportation to add barriers to 1,000 intersections a year. Jackson Chabot of Open Plans said, 'Hardening is what makes daylighting actually work, so the budget item is really crucial to expanding it across the city.' The push follows the 2023 death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a poorly designed corner. The fight for safer streets is far from over.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
