Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'DOT chief pushes back on City Council’s latest street safety proposals,' saw Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez oppose mandatory installation of bollards, safety signs near schools, reflective curbs, and speed bumps near senior centers. Brooks-Powers opened the hearing noting, 'It sounds, unfortunately, like DOT doesn’t support any of the bills that we’re looking to discuss today.' Street safety advocates, including Priscilla Afokoba and Amy Cohen, spoke in favor of the proposals, citing the 255 people killed by motorists in the previous year. The only consensus: a resolution to urge Albany to reduce the speed limit to 5 mph on Open Streets, with Governor Hochul signaling support.

Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the mayor’s budget cuts, saying they undermine safety goals.

The hearing, led by Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, reviewed a slate of bills requiring reflective materials, school safety signs, daylighting, bollards, and more frequent fatality studies. Rodriguez said DOT supports the intent but opposes the bills, citing staffing shortages and a need for flexibility. Brooks-Powers expressed disappointment: 'It sounds, unfortunately, like DOT is not supporting any of the bills.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized city austerity and shrinking staff. Advocates, including Amy Cohen, said the bills 'don’t go nearly far enough.' The hearing exposed deep gaps between Council ambition, DOT capacity, and the urgent need for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, now permanent after a four-year pilot, aims for 'equitable distribution in predominantly low-income Black and brown neighborhoods with limited transportation options.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We now have the proof that convenient access to carshare frees New Yorkers from the burden of car ownership—while helping to fight climate change.' The expansion follows a pilot that saw a 38.7 million mile annual drop in driving and a reduction in private car ownership among participants. Three companies—Zipcar, Getaround, and Truqit—will deploy vehicles in the new spaces. More spots are planned later this year as the city pushes for fewer private cars and safer, less congested streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s summary states, 'The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.' Liu, as the bill’s primary sponsor, emphasized that anyone found with a BAC over 0.05 would be charged with DWI. City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez joined the push, warning, 'Whether they are at 0.06 or 0.12 or 0.20, the consequences can be deadly.' Drunk driving caused 307 deaths in New York State in 2019, nearly a third of all fatal crashes. Utah’s adoption of a 0.05 BAC limit led to a 20% drop in fatal crashes in its first year. The bill is part of a broader effort to protect pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more blind spots.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A 3180 was introduced on February 3, 2023, and is in the sponsorship stage. The bill sits in committee, awaiting further action. Its matter title reads: 'Requires the consideration of complete street design for certain transportation projects which receive federal or state funding.' Didi Barrett leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Amy Paulin, Carrie Woerner, and many others as co-sponsors. The bill compels agencies to consider complete street design—meaning streets built for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users, not just drivers. It also requires the department to publish guidance and reference materials for public use. This measure, if enforced, could reshape how New York builds and rebuilds its roads, putting vulnerable road users at the center of every project.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city wants young voices to remind drivers: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><p class=mb3>On February 3, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced the return of the 'We're Walking Here' competition. This program, paused during the pandemic, targets K-12 students across New York City. The contest runs March 6-31, with students creating public-service announcements to promote walking and traffic safety. Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, representing District 46, voiced support: 'I am happy to support the NYC DOT's relaunch of their "We're Walking Here" campaign to raise awareness of our collective responsibility to eliminate all traffic deaths and serious injuries.' The contest partners with the 'Hip Hop 50' campaign, blending street safety with city culture. Winners receive prizes from The Safe Streets Fund. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called students 'some of our most vulnerable pedestrians.' The program aims to put safety in the hands of those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Children remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On January 25, 2023, the City Council, led by Education Committee Chair Rita Joseph (District 40), pressed the Department of Transportation for transparency on school street safety spending. The matter, titled 'How Much Does DOT Spend to Keep Kids Safe Outside of Schools? The Agency Won’t Say,' exposes DOT’s refusal to disclose project costs or School Safety Unit salaries. Joseph expressed disappointment: 'New Yorkers deserve to know how the DOT is working to make school streets safer.' Councilmember Shahana Hanif also criticized DOT’s inability to track safety projects. Despite Commissioner Rodriguez’s promise of 100 safety projects, the agency denied a FOIL request, claiming costs are not tracked. Advocates and families condemned the lack of accountability. The Department of Education also refused to comment. The city’s silence leaves children exposed on dangerous streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
