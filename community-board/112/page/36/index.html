Two people died. Seven hundred were hurt. Fourteen suffered injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting in hospital halls.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit her, and ran. The police checked the victim, then left. The car was abandoned. The driver vanished. A neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> The street is a gauntlet. The pain is routine.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill>Patterns That Kill</h2><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> It is built into the streets. In the last year, people ages 18 to 34 bore the brunt: over 300 injuries, two deaths. Children and elders are not spared. The most common killers are cars and SUVs, responsible for three deaths and 14 serious injuries in the last three years. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes have left their own scars, but the weight of harm comes from the largest machines.</p><p>The cycle repeats. A man is hit. A woman is left bleeding. A child is struck. The city moves on. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem,&rdquo;</a> said a man named Jordan. The intersection stays the same.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Robert Jackson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. Assembly Member Manny De Los Santos <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored</a> the same. Both voted to extend the city’s speed camera program, a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The streets are still built for speed, not safety. The dead cannot call for change. The living must.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that protect people, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The action followed a 'die-in' protest by cyclists at the site where a truck driver killed Sarah Schick. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We are making immediate signal adjustments to improve safety in this area. We are also committed to delivering a design solution that makes this stretch of Ninth Street safer for cyclists.' Council Member Shahana Hanif added, 'We know that this corridor has been unsafe for far too long and promises had been made after death after death almost the last 20 years.' The city will unveil a redesign in the coming months and adjust signals now. Advocates blame years of inaction for repeated deaths.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) will supply Vision Zero helmets to recipients. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez praised cycling’s power to connect working-class communities and boost life expectancy, saying, "It's about increasing life expectancy, and it's about connecting the working class community." Bike New York CEO Ken Podziba called the program "a transformational power of cycling" to help immigrants acclimate and thrive. The effort responds to the isolation and transportation barriers faced by asylum seekers. Bike donations are accepted at locations in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn.

Projects include 24-7-365 speed cameras, Paseo Park’s permanent open street, Schermerhorn Street’s two-way protected bike lane, Fifth Avenue’s car-free Sundays, Apolline’s Garden intersection redesign, and Emmons Avenue’s new bike lane. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pushed for speed cameras everywhere crashes happen, stating, 'we should have speed cameras everywhere there are crashes.' Despite some local resistance, the city removed parking and created public space, especially after fatal crashes.
