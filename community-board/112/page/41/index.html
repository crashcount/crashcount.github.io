Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The proposal, sent to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, cited low vehicle use and the area's attractions. Piccolo argued, 'The automotive quiet creates the perfect opportunity for the administration to prove its commitment to pedestrians.' The city responded only after media inquiry, with DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone stating the proposal is under review as part of the 'Broadway Vision' plan and inviting groups to apply to the Open Streets program. Piccolo dismissed this as 'bureaucratic nonsense.' The Mayor's Office declined comment. The proposal follows renewed calls for pedestrian safety after a serious crash on Broadway. No formal council bill or committee action is noted. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rodriguez pointed to the city's interagency task force and programs like Plaza Equity and Open Streets. Councilmembers and advocates, including Sara Lind of Open Plans, argued that the current system fails underserved neighborhoods, relying too much on volunteers and business improvement districts. Lind testified, 'Safety improvements to the city’s public space should not require a private partner. An Office of Public Space Management ... could solve this problem.'

Rivera criticized the current system: 'Many of New York's 100 miles of greenways exist only on paper with no cohesive city network.' The bill would require city agencies to present a plan by July 1 next year. It also shifts responsibility from City Planning to agencies that actually build and maintain greenways.

The statement followed a spate of violence: 'Car drivers killed at least three people and injured seven others, including an 11-year-old boy.' The carnage included hit-and-runs, reckless driving, and unlicensed operators. Adams and Rodriguez said they are 'working every day to deliver true public safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and everyone who uses our streets.' They acknowledged recent progress but warned, 'the disturbing incidents we've seen in recent weeks and the last 48 hours remind us just how fragile those positive steps are and how much more work remains.' The city faces one of its most violent years since Vision Zero began. The numbers: 106 killed citywide in the first half of 2022, surpassing 2015. The crisis is not over.

Streets stay risky.</p><p class=mb3>On June 22, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) announced Phase II of its Bronx scooter share pilot. The program now covers the rest of the East Bronx. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We’re thrilled to build on our successful e-scooter pilot in the Bronx and offer this safe and efficient travel option to even more residents.' The expansion doubles the number of scooters and extends service, but protected bike lanes in the new zone remain unfinished. Scooters are banned in some parks, cutting off access to the Ferry Point Park ferry terminal and Orchard Beach. DOT blames interdepartmental issues with the Parks Department. Rodriguez highlighted the pilot’s safety record: no fatalities, few injuries, and safety protocols like speed limits for new users. Residents voiced frustration over limited access. The expansion promises more mobility but leaves gaps in protection for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Plastic bollards, speed bumps, and paint aim to slow drivers. Critics say the pace is glacial. Over 40,000 intersections remain untouched. Seniors keep dying. The city calls it data-driven. Advocates demand more.</p><p class=mb3>On June 15, 2022, the Department of Transportation announced a senior pedestrian safety initiative. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "We are a data-driven administration. We are following the crashes. We are focusing on the most dangerous intersections." The plan targets 50 intersections per year with turn-calming treatments like plastic bollards, rubber speed bumps, and paint. It focuses on 'Senior Pedestrian Zones' with high injury rates, but leaves out some neighborhoods with large senior populations. The plan also expands Leading Pedestrian Intervals and promises at least 10 Senior Street Improvement Projects annually. Critics, including Second Avenue Sagas, slammed the slow pace: "Fifty a year sounds like pushing a boulder up a hill with a toothpick." Advocates call the plan a small step, but say it falls short as senior deaths continue. No council bill number or committee is attached; this is a DOT policy action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
