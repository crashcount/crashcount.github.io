Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No mention of direct safety impact.</p><p class=mb3>On February 9, 2022, the City Council held a hearing on making the Open Restaurants program permanent. The matter, titled 'Could Fees for Outdoor Dining Lead to Proper Pricing of City’s Curbs?', focused on charging restaurants for curbside space. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez explained fees would depend on location and size, starting at $1,050. Council members Julie Menin and Christopher Marte raised concerns about noise, garbage, and parking loss. Livable streets groups, including Open Plans and Transportation Alternatives, supported curbside fees and called for an Office of Public Space Management. Marco Conner DiAquoi of Transportation Alternatives noted, 'Seventy-five percent of our public curb space is devoted to the movement and storage of vehicles.' The hearing showed broad support for better public space management, but the safety impact for vulnerable road users was not addressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A yellow school bus, driven by a 48-year-old man, struck and killed April Reign, a 32-year-old moped rider, near St. Marks Avenue. The driver made a sharp right turn, cut off Reign, knocked her down, and ran her over. He left the scene but later returned after a bystander intervened. No charges were filed at the time. The intersection is notorious for danger, with 487 crashes and 241 injuries reported on this stretch in 2021 alone. Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, called Brooklyn streets 'horrifically deadly for pedestrians and cyclists' and demanded immediate action. Promised safety upgrades—protected bike lanes, intersection redesigns—remain unfulfilled. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation postponed converting the south outer roadway to a pedestrian-only path until December 2023, citing ongoing upper deck repairs. The matter, titled 'City punts fix for ‘treacherous’ Queensboro Bridge bike and pedestrian path by another year,' leaves cyclists and pedestrians sharing a dangerously tight path for another year. Councilmembers Julie Won and Julie Menin urged DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to speed up the process, calling the delay a safety concern. Cycling advocate Laura Shepard criticized the city for prioritizing drivers' comfort over vulnerable road users. DOT insists repairs must finish first.

Council Members Julie Menin and Julie Won, responding to the delay, stated, 'At least two more years of a shared pedestrian and bike path is not the best outcome for our constituents.' Both called for a meeting with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, who reaffirmed his commitment to the project but offered no clear reason for the holdup.

The initiative, not a council bill but a citywide policy, requires all drivers and cyclists to stop for pedestrians at unsignalized crosswalks. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, a former council member, claims the rule protects pedestrians: 'Pedestrians are the ones that we are so committed to protecting in this particular initiative.' Mayor Adams and NYPD Commissioner Sewell stressed enforcement: warnings will end, compliance will be enforced. Advocates like George Calderaro and Jon Orcutt warn of NYPD bias and a crackdown on cyclists. The plan includes engineering fixes at 1,000 intersections, raised crosswalks, more bike corrals, and a public awareness campaign. Advocacy groups back infrastructure but demand fair enforcement, not targeting cyclists. No formal safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rodriguez reaffirmed support for expanding Citi Bike, especially in underserved communities, and for strengthening protected bike lanes. He also voiced support for local control over speed limits and speed cameras, echoing the Crash Victims Rights & Safety Act. Rodriguez said, 'expanding Citi Bike to the underserved community is critical,' but offered few specifics, citing the need for internal review and consultation with the mayor. He acknowledged a 3 percent budget cut but maintained commitment to bike lane protection. Rodriguez's stance signals intent to improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians, but concrete plans remain unclear. The press and public await firmer commitments and timelines.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The car had been abandoned for over two weeks. Streetsblog’s headline reads: "Streetsblog Gets Action: That Derelict Car in Harlem Has Finally Been Removed." Harlem resident Wendy Frank reported the car to the 32nd Precinct in late December. She continues to press city agencies to clear other derelict and abandoned vehicles nearby. The Sanitation Department handles derelict cars, while NYPD deals with abandoned ones. Frank’s persistence forced action, but the city’s slow response leaves more hazards on Harlem streets. No council bill or formal vote was involved in this enforcement action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
