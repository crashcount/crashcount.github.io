The pain fills it.</p><p><strong>Twelve people have died here since 2022.</strong> Hundreds more were hurt. The city logged 4,360 crashes in this board’s bounds. Pedestrians took 456 injuries. Cyclists took 258. The numbers come from the city’s own database and our rollups.</p><h3 id=broadway-and-the-parkway-keep-taking>Broadway and the Parkway keep taking</h3><p>BROADWAY leads the injury list with 277 people hurt and one death. HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY shows 222 injuries and three deaths. Those are the top hot spots in CB12’s data. See the city’s crash feed for the cases.</p><p>A crash on the Henry Hudson at 2:25 a.m. killed two people and hurt another, according to the city’s record of <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4750210</a>. Four vehicles. Two dead at the scene. The file lists a pickup “demolished.”</p><p>On FORT GEORGE AVE and AUDUBON, a 25‑year‑old motorcycle rider was ejected and killed at 9:44 p.m., per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4743277</a>.</p><p>On WEST 181 STREET, a 37‑year‑old bicyclist died at 3:57 a.m. after striking a parked tractor trailer, the city’s log says in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4729767</a>.</p><h3 id=nights-are-loud-with-sirens>Nights are loud with sirens</h3><p>Injuries pile up after dark. Between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m., the hours with the most recorded deaths were 2 a.m. (three), 3 a.m. (one), 4 a.m. (two), 9 p.m. (one), 10 p.m. (one), and 5 p.m.–6 p.m.–7 p.m.–8 p.m.–9 p.m. all show heavy injury counts. At 6 p.m., injuries spike to 136 with ten serious. That is the peak for severe harm in this dataset.</p><h3 id=speed-inattention-and-a-red-light-run>Speed, inattention, and a red light run</h3><p>“Unsafe speed” shows up in the fatal moped crash on SAINT NICHOLAS AVE and WEST 185 STREET. A 15‑year‑old was killed. The city’s file cites speed and a traffic control disregard in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4678005</a>.</p><p>Across CB12’s rollup, “failure to yield,” “unsafe speed,” “inattention,” and “disregarded traffic control” appear as contributing factors. Five deaths sit under “other/unspecified” in the city’s summaries. We don’t get answers there. Only bodies.</p><h3 id=trucks-suvs-and-the-human-cost>Trucks, SUVs, and the human cost</h3><p>SUVs and cars account for most pedestrian harm here, with 396 recorded pedestrian injury cases tied to them in the rollup. Trucks and buses appear less often, but when they do, the damage is heavy. One parked tractor trailer is the last thing a rider saw on West 181st.</p><h3 id=fix-the-blocks-we-know-are-deadly>Fix the blocks we know are deadly</h3><p>Start where the data points. Harden turns and add daylighting on BROADWAY’s worst stretches. Add protected space and signal priority for walkers and riders at the ramps feeding HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY. Put truck loading where it does not force a human into a live lane on WEST 181 STREET. These are standard tools the city already uses.</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-are-on-the-table>Citywide tools are on the table</h3><p>Albany renewed the 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, according to <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>. That program is now law through 2030, the report says. The Senate and Assembly votes from local lawmakers are on the record in our timeline.</p><p>The state is also moving a bill to force speed‑limiters on repeat violators. In the Senate, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> advanced with yes votes from local Senator Robert Jackson in June 2025. In the Assembly, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a> has co‑sponsors from uptown. The bill would require intelligent speed assistance after repeated violations.</p><p>NYC now has the power to lower speeds. Sammy’s Law gave the city authority, and the Council and DOT have begun to use it in places. Our own action page explains how to press for a 20 mph default and the speed‑limiter bills. Slower cars mean fewer funerals.</p><h3 id=no-comfort-in-the-ledger>No comfort in the ledger</h3><p>CB12 shows zero recorded deaths year‑to‑date, but the bodies since 2022 are still on our streets. Two at 2:25 a.m. on the Parkway. A teen on St. Nicholas. A rider on 181st. One death on Sherman. The ledger keeps their times. The corners stay the same.</p><p>Take one step: tell City Hall and Albany to slow the traffic and end the repeat speeding.

Riders now move straighter, faster, safer. Crosswalks grew. Concrete replaced chaos. Thousands of Bronx commuters feel the change underfoot and in the ride.</p><p class=mb3>On January 24, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced sidewalk expansion and new contraflow bus lanes at Pelham Bay Park station in the East Bronx. The project, begun in September 2021 and finished last fall, added 1,285 square feet of sidewalk, a new median, and red bus-only lanes on Westchester Avenue. The DOT worked with the MTA to cut a circuitous bus detour, giving Bx12 and other riders a direct path. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'DOT’s work at Pelham Bay Park... may be only one-10th of a mile, but the impact for thousands of riders will be gigantic.' New York City Transit President Richard Davey added, 'Bus lanes don't have to be miles long to deliver a huge impact.' The changes serve 64,000 daily riders, expanding space for pedestrians and shortening bus trips. More crosswalks now connect the busy transfer point, making the area less hostile for those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their bodies blocked traffic. The city finally promised a redesign. DOT will add signal changes now. For years, officials ignored calls to fix this deadly stretch. Now, pressure mounts.</p><p class=mb3>On January 20, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced plans to redesign the unprotected portion of Ninth Street after a fatal crash. The action followed a 'die-in' protest by cyclists at the site where a truck driver killed Sarah Schick. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We are making immediate signal adjustments to improve safety in this area. We are also committed to delivering a design solution that makes this stretch of Ninth Street safer for cyclists.' Council Member Shahana Hanif added, 'We know that this corridor has been unsafe for far too long and promises had been made after death after death almost the last 20 years.' The city will unveil a redesign in the coming months and adjust signals now. Advocates blame years of inaction for repeated deaths. The matter remains urgent for all who use Ninth Street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The numbers show progress.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC’s 'Streetsies 2022' roundup, published December 27, 2022, highlights major NYC DOT projects that reshaped city streets. The article celebrates a 7% drop in traffic fatalities and fewer pedestrian deaths, crediting street redesigns. Projects include 24-7-365 speed cameras, Paseo Park’s permanent open street, Schermerhorn Street’s two-way protected bike lane, Fifth Avenue’s car-free Sundays, Apolline’s Garden intersection redesign, and Emmons Avenue’s new bike lane. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pushed for speed cameras everywhere crashes happen, stating, 'we should have speed cameras everywhere there are crashes.' Despite some local resistance, the city removed parking and created public space, especially after fatal crashes. These changes, backed by council support and public demand, show clear safety gains for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
