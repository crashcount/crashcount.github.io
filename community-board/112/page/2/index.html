Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, selected from three options, creates center-running bus lanes from Livingston Street to Grand Army Plaza. The matter title: 'Busy Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn would get new bus lanes under DOT redesign plan.' Council Member Barbara Russo-Lennon supports the redesign. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the proposal would create a welcoming corridor for all. Demetrius Crichlow of NYC Transit backed the plan, citing faster commutes. The redesign removes two car lanes, adds boarding islands, benches, and canopies. According to safety analysts, center-running bus lanes cut conflicts at the curb, calm traffic, and boost safety and comfort for vulnerable road users—pedestrians and cyclists. The plan now heads to community boards for review and input.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The demonstration, which began at Union Square, challenged new policies issuing criminal summonses for minor cycling offenses. Riders followed traffic laws, highlighting the crackdown’s contradictions. One cyclist, Erin Poland, said the policy 'is not actually protecting cyclists [but] putting them in more danger.' Another, Tara Pham, noted, 'I’ve been hit by vehicles twice... those drivers face no criminal charges.' The article details how police arrested a Citi Bike rider for not moving aside and lacking ID, while drivers who injure vulnerable road users often avoid serious consequences.

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers. Policy gaps and unequal penalties expose systemic danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "This rule change expands safe and practical travel options for moped riders—particularly the thousands of delivery workers and commuters who depend on them every day, while also enhancing safety for pedestrians and cyclists by reducing conflicts on shared crossings." The rule takes effect June 26. The move follows years of complaints about mopeds crowding bike lanes and endangering cyclists and pedestrians. Streetsblog NYC reported the change, noting that previous city law forced mopeds into bike lanes, creating hazardous conditions. Removing mopeds from bike lanes reduces conflicts and speeds in spaces intended for vulnerable users, improving safety and comfort for pedestrians and cyclists and supporting mode shift.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Bklyn Tween Speaks Truth to Mayor Adams on Supposedly ‘Dangerous’ Bike Lane, Gets Booed By Hasidic Men,' saw Rafe Herzfeld, a 12-year-old resident, defend the protected bike lane. Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez responded, with Rodriguez stating, 'Bedford Avenue is simply safer since the bike lane went in.' The meeting drew about 150 Hasidic men and other locals, some of whom booed Herzfeld. The safety_impact_note clarifies: 'The event described is a town hall meeting with no direct policy action or legislative change affecting pedestrian or cyclist safety.' The night showed deep divides but no new law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She was conscious at the scene and wore a helmet. The truck driver, a 50-year-old man, was not reported injured. The report lists no other contributing factors.

Federal threats landed flat. Letters flew. Deadlines passed. The fight over Manhattan’s tolls moved to courtrooms. Officials called the process a sham. Transit funding hung in the balance. Streets stayed dangerous. Cars kept coming.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published May 22, 2025), the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) refused to halt Manhattan’s congestion pricing despite a fourth federal deadline. The MTA and state officials dismissed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s threats to withdraw funding as a 'sham,' arguing that the dispute is already in court. Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.' The federal government’s push to end the tolls, and the MTA’s resistance, highlight a clash over control of city streets and transit funding. No mention of driver actions, but the policy fight leaves vulnerable road users exposed as the legal battle drags on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cars keep two lanes. Buses lose out. Cyclists get nothing. Sidewalks widen, but most space stays with traffic. Critics say safety for walkers and riders is left behind.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the city's announcement of a $550 million redesign for Fifth Avenue. The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
