Two people died. Seven hundred were hurt. Fourteen suffered injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting in hospital halls.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit her, and ran. The police checked the victim, then left. The car was abandoned. The driver vanished. A neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> The street is a gauntlet. The pain is routine.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill>Patterns That Kill</h2><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> It is built into the streets. In the last year, people ages 18 to 34 bore the brunt: over 300 injuries, two deaths. Children and elders are not spared. The most common killers are cars and SUVs, responsible for three deaths and 14 serious injuries in the last three years. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes have left their own scars, but the weight of harm comes from the largest machines.</p><p>The cycle repeats. A man is hit. A woman is left bleeding. A child is struck. The city moves on. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem,&rdquo;</a> said a man named Jordan. The intersection stays the same.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Robert Jackson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. Assembly Member Manny De Los Santos <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored</a> the same. Both voted to extend the city’s speed camera program, a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The streets are still built for speed, not safety. The dead cannot call for change. The living must.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that protect people, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The program, managed by DOT, is the largest in the nation for speeding, red light, and bus lane violations. The RFP follows a city comptroller report showing Verra Mobility, the current contractor, rejected 41.5% of photos—often due to obscured or defaced license plates—costing the city over $100 million in lost fines. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the automated enforcement programs 'key to our Vision Zero efforts to save lives on our streets.' The RFP seeks to leverage new camera technology to address the surge in hidden plates and ensure stronger oversight. New equipment is expected by August 2025. Verra may reapply, but DOT wants a vendor who can catch more dangerous drivers and keep enforcement strong.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision involved a 2016 Honda taxi and a 2023 moped, both traveling northwest and making right turns. The point of impact was the taxi's right front bumper and the moped's left front quarter panel. The moped driver, a 21-year-old male, was injured with abrasions to his knee, lower leg, and foot but was conscious and not ejected. The report explicitly cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the contributing factor, indicating the taxi driver failed to obey traffic signals or signs. No other contributing factors or victim behaviors were noted. The taxi driver was licensed and operating legally, but the failure to yield or obey traffic control led to this collision and injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report notes that the driver was unlicensed and fled south after the collision, leaving the vehicle undamaged. Police cite 'Driver Inexperience' as a contributing factor.

She said, "If we're seeing that these stations aren't being used adequately ... is there another option, can we make the docks smaller?" The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, defended the current system. Bike-share experts like David Eddington countered that full docks signal popularity, not neglect. Citi Bike General Manager Patrick Knoth explained that point-in-time observations mislead, as ridership is strong and docks are planned based on trends. Citi Bike usage in Stevens's district rose 48 percent from 2022 to 2023, with most riders using reduced fares. The hearing highlighted the need for a comprehensive, accessible bike-share network, especially as e-bikes make hilly areas more reachable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now under consideration, has strong support: sixteen community boards and over three dozen elected officials have signed on. The measure aims to remove parked cars from corners, a practice called 'daylighting,' to improve visibility and cut intersection crashes. Simon called it a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez has voiced concerns that daylighting could lead to faster, more dangerous turns, but advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans counter that daylighting is 'proven and widely popular.' The DOT missed a deadline for a daylighting safety study but claims it will daylight 1,000 intersections this year. Advocates urge the city to follow the law and protect vulnerable road users at every intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Hey, Gov.

The piece criticizes Governor Hochul’s decision to cancel congestion pricing, arguing it denies New Yorkers the safety and freedom seen in Stockholm’s pedestrianized, business-friendly streets. The commentary features voices like Clarence Eckerson and Lars Strömgren, highlighting the benefits for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and children—who thrive when cars are fewer.
