Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary reads: 'DOT cuts ribbon on newly fortified Schermerhorn Street bike lane.' Councilmember Lincoln Restler, who championed the redesign, attended the event and called it 'a great friggin day for Brooklyn.' The old lanes were unprotected and blocked by double-parked cars, forcing cyclists into traffic. Since 2012, 29 cyclists have been injured and one killed along this stretch.

Joseph, in a joint statement with Transportation Alternatives, said, "The tragic death of yet another cyclist in our city, this time in my own neighborhood, shows how far we need to come to address traffic violence." Joseph called for urgent action to make streets safer. Parkside Avenue, not a designated truck route, has seen 161 injuries in five years, including 28 cyclists and 25 pedestrians. Advocates, including Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives, demanded the city fast-track protected bike lanes, warning, "Lives are on the line." The city has completed eight miles of protected lanes this year, with a goal of 20 by January. The push for protected infrastructure follows a spike in traffic deaths and ongoing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer vows investigation.</p><p class=mb3>On October 5, 2022, Council Member Gale Brewer, chair of the Council's oversight committee, announced plans to investigate the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) street safety claims. Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress. Road deaths remain high, and the city lags on legal mandates for bus and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measures, revived in committee, seek to redesign truck routes and gather data on facilities run by Amazon, FedEx, and UPS. The matter aims to 'reduce congestion and emissions, improve safety and increase visibility,' especially in overburdened neighborhoods like Red Hook and Sunset Park. Avilés, the lead sponsor, calls for systematic changes: 'We really need to look systematically at more improved routes to ensure people are safe.' The bills would require the Department of Transportation to daylight intersections and the Department of Environmental Protection to install air monitors on heavy-use roads. Councilwoman Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsors a related bill for public truck-route data. The legislation draws support from industry and advocates, all seeking safer streets and cleaner air for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

We were just keeping the lights on.' Another warns, 'The agency's ability to respond to severe injuries and fatalities is also limited and slow.' Political interference and lack of expertise at the top deepen the crisis. The result: fewer bus lanes, stalled bike infrastructure, and a city where vulnerable road users face mounting danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter calls for urgent upgrades to the 133-year-old Washington Bridge. The officials demand a two-way protected bike lane, wider pedestrian paths, improved lighting, and safety cameras. The letter states: 'The city has done a terrific job of making wise investments in improving mobility on both sides of the Harlem River, but left the bridge with just two very narrow, poorly lit lanes for foot and bike traffic.' Stevens and her colleagues stress that the bridge is unsafe for people on foot and bike. They urge DOT to act, citing the need to reduce traffic deaths and make the bridge safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Only 395 saw changes. Most were minor tweaks to signal timing. Few got real redesigns. Advocates are angry. Fatalities stay high. The city moves slow. Streets remain deadly for walkers and riders.</p><p class=mb3>This is a progress report on Mayor Adams’s 1,000-intersection safety pledge, published September 21, 2022. The Department of Transportation claims only 395 intersections improved since the January 19 announcement. Most changes were limited to signal timing (LPIs), not physical redesigns. The matter centers on the mayor’s vow to 'make expedient and substantive changes to dangerous intersections.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s earlier claims of progress are not supported by public data. Advocates like Liz Denys (Transportation Alternatives) and Sara Lind (Open Plans) criticize the slow pace and lack of real fixes. Lind urges, 'The city must allocate the resources needed for DOT to employ their full toolkit of redesign tools.' Council members and community boards are called to help identify and fix dangerous spots. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The moped struck the sedan’s left side doors, damaging its center front. The sedan driver was licensed. The moped driver wore a helmet, but the crash was caused by the sedan’s maneuver and unsafe speed.
