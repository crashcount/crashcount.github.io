The pain fills it.</p><p><strong>Twelve people have died here since 2022.</strong> Hundreds more were hurt. The city logged 4,360 crashes in this board’s bounds. Pedestrians took 456 injuries. Cyclists took 258. The numbers come from the city’s own database and our rollups.</p><h3 id=broadway-and-the-parkway-keep-taking>Broadway and the Parkway keep taking</h3><p>BROADWAY leads the injury list with 277 people hurt and one death. HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY shows 222 injuries and three deaths. Those are the top hot spots in CB12’s data. See the city’s crash feed for the cases.</p><p>A crash on the Henry Hudson at 2:25 a.m. killed two people and hurt another, according to the city’s record of <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4750210</a>. Four vehicles. Two dead at the scene. The file lists a pickup “demolished.”</p><p>On FORT GEORGE AVE and AUDUBON, a 25‑year‑old motorcycle rider was ejected and killed at 9:44 p.m., per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4743277</a>.</p><p>On WEST 181 STREET, a 37‑year‑old bicyclist died at 3:57 a.m. after striking a parked tractor trailer, the city’s log says in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4729767</a>.</p><h3 id=nights-are-loud-with-sirens>Nights are loud with sirens</h3><p>Injuries pile up after dark. Between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m., the hours with the most recorded deaths were 2 a.m. (three), 3 a.m. (one), 4 a.m. (two), 9 p.m. (one), 10 p.m. (one), and 5 p.m.–6 p.m.–7 p.m.–8 p.m.–9 p.m. all show heavy injury counts. At 6 p.m., injuries spike to 136 with ten serious. That is the peak for severe harm in this dataset.</p><h3 id=speed-inattention-and-a-red-light-run>Speed, inattention, and a red light run</h3><p>“Unsafe speed” shows up in the fatal moped crash on SAINT NICHOLAS AVE and WEST 185 STREET. A 15‑year‑old was killed. The city’s file cites speed and a traffic control disregard in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4678005</a>.</p><p>Across CB12’s rollup, “failure to yield,” “unsafe speed,” “inattention,” and “disregarded traffic control” appear as contributing factors. Five deaths sit under “other/unspecified” in the city’s summaries. We don’t get answers there. Only bodies.</p><h3 id=trucks-suvs-and-the-human-cost>Trucks, SUVs, and the human cost</h3><p>SUVs and cars account for most pedestrian harm here, with 396 recorded pedestrian injury cases tied to them in the rollup. Trucks and buses appear less often, but when they do, the damage is heavy. One parked tractor trailer is the last thing a rider saw on West 181st.</p><h3 id=fix-the-blocks-we-know-are-deadly>Fix the blocks we know are deadly</h3><p>Start where the data points. Harden turns and add daylighting on BROADWAY’s worst stretches. Add protected space and signal priority for walkers and riders at the ramps feeding HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY. Put truck loading where it does not force a human into a live lane on WEST 181 STREET. These are standard tools the city already uses.</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-are-on-the-table>Citywide tools are on the table</h3><p>Albany renewed the 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, according to <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>. That program is now law through 2030, the report says. The Senate and Assembly votes from local lawmakers are on the record in our timeline.</p><p>The state is also moving a bill to force speed‑limiters on repeat violators. In the Senate, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> advanced with yes votes from local Senator Robert Jackson in June 2025. In the Assembly, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a> has co‑sponsors from uptown. The bill would require intelligent speed assistance after repeated violations.</p><p>NYC now has the power to lower speeds. Sammy’s Law gave the city authority, and the Council and DOT have begun to use it in places. Our own action page explains how to press for a 20 mph default and the speed‑limiter bills. Slower cars mean fewer funerals.</p><h3 id=no-comfort-in-the-ledger>No comfort in the ledger</h3><p>CB12 shows zero recorded deaths year‑to‑date, but the bodies since 2022 are still on our streets. Two at 2:25 a.m. on the Parkway. A teen on St. Nicholas. A rider on 181st. One death on Sherman. The ledger keeps their times. The corners stay the same.</p><p>Take one step: tell City Hall and Albany to slow the traffic and end the repeat speeding.

Most cars parked illegally belong to repeat offenders. Police dump junk and ignore laws. Pedestrians pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published March 15, 2022, covers Streetsblog NYC’s 'March (Parking) Madness' contest, spotlighting the 69th and 83rd NYPD precincts. Both precincts, near subway stops and with parking lots, still see officers parking on sidewalks and blocking pedestrian access. The article states: 'Many of the cars parked illegally by officers have multiple red light and speed camera violations, with the 69th Precinct having a particularly high percentage of repeat offenders.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the City Council that multiple camera violations should be rare, but precinct records show otherwise. The investigation criticizes NYPD’s disregard for pedestrian space and traffic laws, documenting officers’ contempt for street safety and the law. No council bill is attached, but the report exposes systemic danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot, announced by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, places six-bike Oonee pods at five locations across three boroughs for 29 days each, sidestepping lengthy franchise reviews. Rodriguez said, "We have found a way to make a secure parking pilot work for New York City." Bike New York's Jon Orcutt voiced frustration: "Enough with the pilots. We love Oonee, but if it doesn't scale, it doesn't matter." The DOT will collect usage data to inform future steps. Assistant Commissioner Sean Quinn noted the limited number of pods and the need for broader access. The program marks progress after years of failed attempts, but advocates demand a permanent, citywide network to truly protect cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Barriers vanished without warning, then returned after public outcry. Councilmember Crystal Hudson stood firm. DOT cited rising crash deaths. Most neighbors backed the car-free stretch.</p><p class=mb3>"What we have seen in the last two years is an increase in crashes... We have seen a lot of New Yorkers losing their life... But we want you to know that we have a responsibility to think about, first of all, protecting our senior citizens is our top priority." -- Ydanis A. Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On March 8, 2022, Councilmember Crystal Hudson hosted a heated debate on the Willoughby Avenue open street in District 35. The meeting followed the abrupt, unannounced removal of barriers from the eight-block stretch, which sparked swift backlash. Hudson, joined by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez, faced vocal opponents worried about lost parking and emergency access. Hudson said, 'This is about more than just open streets, this is about safe streets.' DOT surveys showed 88 percent support for permanent safety changes. Mayor Eric Adams ordered the street restored after learning Hudson opposed its closure. Rodríguez highlighted a spike in traffic deaths, noting, 'We have a responsibility to think about, first of all, protecting our senior citizens.' According to NYC Crash Mapper, 72 people—mostly cyclists and motorists—were injured on this stretch in the past decade, but no deaths. The open streets program, launched during the pandemic, remains popular and aims to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter, published by Streetsblog NYC, highlights the deadly toll on Canal Street: 4,817 crashes, 109 cyclists and 190 pedestrians injured, and six vulnerable road users killed since the de Blasio era. Massengale writes, 'We need a better New York City, with fewer cars, less death, and healthier streets.' He criticizes DOT’s focus on moving cars and incremental safety fixes, calling them 'band aids.' Massengale urges Rodriguez to return to Vision Zero’s promise and adopt bold, systemic changes.

Since 2019, 67 cyclists have been injured and 196 crashes reported. The letter urges the city to replace weak barriers, fix dangerous entrances, and finally deliver safety for vulnerable road users.

Restler, along with Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Julia Salazar, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, signed a letter urging Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriguez to act. The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected.
