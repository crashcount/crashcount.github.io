Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

His team built too few bus lanes and bike paths. Commutes drag. Riders and cyclists pay the price. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams called out DOT’s failure. The city’s poorest wait longer. Streets stay dangerous. Promises broken.</p><p class=mb3>On December 27, 2024, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (District 28) condemned the Adams administration for failing to meet the 2019 Streets Plan’s legal requirements. The Department of Transportation installed only about five miles of protected bus lanes and 22 miles of protected bike lanes—far below the mandated 30 and 50 miles. The matter, titled 'Worst Mayor Ever for Bus Riders? Adams's Streets Plan Failure Means Longer Commutes for the Poorest New Yorkers,' highlights how DOT’s underperformance has slowed bus speeds and left vulnerable road users exposed. Speaker Adams, through spokesperson Mara Davis, called the Streets Plan benchmarks 'critical for street safety' and criticized DOT for 'consistently fall[ing] short of complying with the law.' Pending legislation seeks more transparency. The city’s neglect leaves riders and cyclists in danger, with no relief in sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 34-year-old male bicyclist was injured and ejected from his bike, sustaining abrasions and upper leg injuries.

Both vehicles showed no damage, but the impact caused the bicyclist to be ejected. The sedan driver failed to maintain a safe distance behind the cyclist, directly leading to the collision. There are no listed contributing factors related to the bicyclist's behavior or equipment.
