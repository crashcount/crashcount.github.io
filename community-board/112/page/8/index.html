Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous.

Lawmakers promise change.</p><p class=mb3>On April 1, 2025, Council Member Shahana Hanif joined a rally at Brooklyn Borough Hall demanding passage of the Stop Super Speeders bill. The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws. Some opposition remains, but supporters say the measure is urgent and practical.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say it targets families, seniors, and delivery workers. DOT calls it costly, unproven. Advocates demand safer streets, not new hurdles. Motor vehicles, not e-bikes, remain the real threat. The fight over who belongs on city roads rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On March 27, 2025, mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo supported a Republican-backed proposal to require registration and license plates for all e-bikes in New York City. The plan, not yet introduced as a formal bill, would cost $20 million, according to the Department of Transportation. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from e-bike users, advocates, and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The matter centers on Cuomo's claim that registration will address 'chaos and promote safety.' Critics, including Queens cycling advocate Jim Burke and safe streets organizer Noel Hidalgo, argue the measure 'demonizes' e-bike users and ignores the real danger: reckless driving by motorists. Advocates say the plan would harm families, seniors, and delivery workers who rely on e-bikes, especially in transit deserts. They urge lawmakers to focus on street design and car enforcement, not new restrictions. The proposal has not advanced to committee or vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At a community meeting, Brooks-Powers said, "We’ve been trying to get [the bike lane] removed for three years. It wasn’t supported by the community. ... In effect it’s not a bike lane quite honestly; no one uses it, they [drivers] park there. We would like to see the hard infrastructure removed." Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that building safe bike lanes requires support from local leaders. DOT spokesperson Will Livingston said the agency remains committed to safety and will explore hardening the lane and increasing enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when a 2016 Ford SUV, traveling westbound, struck him.

Streets stay dangerous while projects stall. Open Streets needs cash. Without workers, intersections stay deadly. The city’s budget holds lives in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2025, Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31) joined transportation advocates in calling for increased funding and staffing for the Department of Transportation (DOT). The push, highlighted in a letter to city officials, urges an end to the DOT hiring freeze and more resources for street safety projects. The letter states: 'With sufficient staffing and funding, DOT could help New York City improve street safety, reduce car dependency, meet our climate goals, and bring reliable transit service to more neighborhoods.' Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives testified at a council hearing, warning, 'An underfunded DOT doesn’t just mean more dangerous streets—it also means a less liveable, vibrant, and thriving city.' Brooks-Powers and advocates argue that without more staff and money, life-saving projects like Open Streets will not expand. The city’s budget, they say, is a statement of values—and right now, it leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooklyn’s first Regional Slow Zone targets crowded streets. Ten severe injuries and one death in five years haunt the area. Council Member Restler and DOT push for slower traffic. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2025, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced the lowering of Dumbo’s speed limit to 20 mph, making it Brooklyn’s first Regional Slow Zone. The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
