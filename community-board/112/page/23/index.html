The pain fills it.</p><p><strong>Twelve people have died here since 2022.</strong> Hundreds more were hurt. The city logged 4,360 crashes in this board’s bounds. Pedestrians took 456 injuries. Cyclists took 258. The numbers come from the city’s own database and our rollups.</p><h3 id=broadway-and-the-parkway-keep-taking>Broadway and the Parkway keep taking</h3><p>BROADWAY leads the injury list with 277 people hurt and one death. HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY shows 222 injuries and three deaths. Those are the top hot spots in CB12’s data. See the city’s crash feed for the cases.</p><p>A crash on the Henry Hudson at 2:25 a.m. killed two people and hurt another, according to the city’s record of <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4750210</a>. Four vehicles. Two dead at the scene. The file lists a pickup “demolished.”</p><p>On FORT GEORGE AVE and AUDUBON, a 25‑year‑old motorcycle rider was ejected and killed at 9:44 p.m., per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4743277</a>.</p><p>On WEST 181 STREET, a 37‑year‑old bicyclist died at 3:57 a.m. after striking a parked tractor trailer, the city’s log says in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4729767</a>.</p><h3 id=nights-are-loud-with-sirens>Nights are loud with sirens</h3><p>Injuries pile up after dark. Between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m., the hours with the most recorded deaths were 2 a.m. (three), 3 a.m. (one), 4 a.m. (two), 9 p.m. (one), 10 p.m. (one), and 5 p.m.–6 p.m.–7 p.m.–8 p.m.–9 p.m. all show heavy injury counts. At 6 p.m., injuries spike to 136 with ten serious. That is the peak for severe harm in this dataset.</p><h3 id=speed-inattention-and-a-red-light-run>Speed, inattention, and a red light run</h3><p>“Unsafe speed” shows up in the fatal moped crash on SAINT NICHOLAS AVE and WEST 185 STREET. A 15‑year‑old was killed. The city’s file cites speed and a traffic control disregard in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4678005</a>.</p><p>Across CB12’s rollup, “failure to yield,” “unsafe speed,” “inattention,” and “disregarded traffic control” appear as contributing factors. Five deaths sit under “other/unspecified” in the city’s summaries. We don’t get answers there. Only bodies.</p><h3 id=trucks-suvs-and-the-human-cost>Trucks, SUVs, and the human cost</h3><p>SUVs and cars account for most pedestrian harm here, with 396 recorded pedestrian injury cases tied to them in the rollup. Trucks and buses appear less often, but when they do, the damage is heavy. One parked tractor trailer is the last thing a rider saw on West 181st.</p><h3 id=fix-the-blocks-we-know-are-deadly>Fix the blocks we know are deadly</h3><p>Start where the data points. Harden turns and add daylighting on BROADWAY’s worst stretches. Add protected space and signal priority for walkers and riders at the ramps feeding HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY. Put truck loading where it does not force a human into a live lane on WEST 181 STREET. These are standard tools the city already uses.</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-are-on-the-table>Citywide tools are on the table</h3><p>Albany renewed the 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, according to <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>. That program is now law through 2030, the report says. The Senate and Assembly votes from local lawmakers are on the record in our timeline.</p><p>The state is also moving a bill to force speed‑limiters on repeat violators. In the Senate, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> advanced with yes votes from local Senator Robert Jackson in June 2025. In the Assembly, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a> has co‑sponsors from uptown. The bill would require intelligent speed assistance after repeated violations.</p><p>NYC now has the power to lower speeds. Sammy’s Law gave the city authority, and the Council and DOT have begun to use it in places. Our own action page explains how to press for a 20 mph default and the speed‑limiter bills. Slower cars mean fewer funerals.</p><h3 id=no-comfort-in-the-ledger>No comfort in the ledger</h3><p>CB12 shows zero recorded deaths year‑to‑date, but the bodies since 2022 are still on our streets. Two at 2:25 a.m. on the Parkway. A teen on St. Nicholas. A rider on 181st. One death on Sherman. The ledger keeps their times. The corners stay the same.</p><p>Take one step: tell City Hall and Albany to slow the traffic and end the repeat speeding.

Two-way bus lanes now run where cars once clogged. Concrete islands keep buses moving. Councilmember Restler says the era of endless traffic is over. Riders get speed. Streets get order. Danger shifts.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2024, the city completed a new busway on Livingston Street in Brooklyn. The project, not tied to a specific bill number, was led by the Department of Transportation and praised by Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33). The redesign turned a congested, two-way street into a one-way westbound corridor with two directions of physically-separated, dedicated bus lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the project 'transformed what was a congested, double-parked corridor into two-way fully protected and dedicated bus lanes.' Restler declared, 'Those days are over with the new Livingston Busway!' The project aims to speed up service for 50,000 daily riders and keep cars out of bus lanes with concrete boarding islands. While the article notes ongoing issues with illegal parking and citywide delays, the Livingston Street busway stands as a rare win for bus riders and vulnerable street users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, held at a W. 84th Street school, was the first outreach for a study on curb management. The DOT described the meeting as a chance to 'help craft a proposal' and denied any plan to eliminate all parking. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We wanted to start here, in this pilot project, listening from the community on how we reimagine the community.' Residents, spurred by misinformation, confronted officials and voiced fears over losing parking. Some, like Andy Rosenthal, supported loading zones. Others, like activist Andrew Fine, rejected the process outright. The meeting highlighted deep divides over curb use, but also the urgent need to address double parking and blocked bike lanes that endanger pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, led by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, was described as 'transformative' and aimed at safety for all users. The official summary states: 'The city's redesign of Third Avenue adds a wide protected bike lane and an offset bus lane over 37 blocks.' Despite these changes, advocates and local politicians criticized the plan for leaving three moving lanes and two parking lanes for cars, calling for more sidewalk space and loading zones. The redesign ends at 96th Street, where the old, car-focused layout returns. Advocates say the city must 'aim higher' to truly protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At NYC intersections, daylighting zones without barriers become illegal parking lots. City vehicles ignore the rules. Pedestrians lose ground. Advocates demand real protection—bike racks, boulders, planters. Paint alone is empty promise. Lives remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the ongoing debate over New York City’s daylighting policy, highlighted in a December 5, 2023 Streetsblog NYC article. Mayor Adams pledged to clear parking near 1,000 intersections yearly to improve visibility and reduce crashes. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, told the City Council that daylighting 'must be implemented with physical infrastructure in the newly opened space to prevent vehicles from turning more quickly.' Advocacy Director Jon Orcutt of Bike New York dismissed paint-only solutions: 'If it’s just paint in 2023, forget about it.' The article documents rampant illegal parking in painted daylighting zones, often by city vehicles. Advocates argue that only physical barriers—bike racks, boulders, planters—can keep cars out and protect pedestrians. Without them, daylighting is a hollow gesture. The city’s current approach leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
