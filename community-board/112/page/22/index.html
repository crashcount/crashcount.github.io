Bill pushes complete street design. Aim: safer roads for all. Pedestrians, cyclists, and riders get space. Car dominance challenged. Lawmakers move to cut street carnage.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 2714, titled 'Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles,' advanced through committee and passed several Senate votes, most recently on March 27, 2024. Sponsored by Timothy M. Kennedy with support from Jake Ashby, Jamaal Bailey, and others, the bill mandates street designs that protect everyone—not just drivers. The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The bill marks a shift away from car-first planning, forcing cities to build streets for people, not just traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Now, longer cargo bikes roll legal. Four-wheelers, capped at 15 mph, can haul freight. Trucks choke streets and kill. Cargo bikes offer a safer, cleaner way. Industry pushed. DOT listened. Streets change. Pedestrians and cyclists breathe easier.</p><p class=mb3>On March 27, 2024, the NYC Department of Transportation finalized new cargo bike rules after months of industry pushback. The rules, shaped by public comment, allow pedal-assist cargo bikes up to four feet wide and 192 inches long, with four wheels, and set a 15 mph speed cap. The original proposal would have banned most existing cargo bike-trailer setups with a 120-inch limit. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez promised to get it right. Mark Chiusano, CEO of Net Zero Logistics, praised the fix: "They did a really good job of fixing the original version and made good on their word." Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi said, "We are accommodating this change in consumer culture—encouraging environmental package delivery, away from cars and trucks." Ben Morris of Coaster Cycles warned the old cap would have wiped out the market. DOT's move aims to cut truck traffic, which causes 12% of pedestrian and 30% of cyclist deaths. The new rules create a legal path for safer, greener freight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

But the most dangerous drivers remain loose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2024, the Department of Transportation released a report urging passage of a bill to expand New York City’s red-light camera program. The bill, supported by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and sponsored by State Senator Andrew Goundardes, would boost camera coverage from 150 to 1,325 intersections—about 10% of the city’s 13,700 signals. The report states: “Expanding the number of intersections with red light cameras... could substantially enhance the deterrent effect of the program and return New York City to the consistently downward trend of red light-running behavior we had seen prior to the pandemic.” Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz also supports expansion, calling for cameras at every intersection. The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains. Relatives of crash victims joined the call, demanding the city confront driver negligence and protect the community.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill follows a surge in deadly e-bike crashes—23 deaths last year, up from nine in 2022. The city’s new campaign, 'get smart before you start,' aims to educate riders on safe operation. Rajkumar’s bill drew immediate opposition from delivery workers. Gustavo Ajche of Los Deliveristas Unidos said, 'We're deeply disappointed to see local and state leaders introduce legislation that would put the burden of penalty on delivery workers rather than trying to regulate the app companies.'

The boards urge the city to stop exempting itself from state law requiring no parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. The resolution follows fatal crashes involving children at poorly visible corners. The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data. DOT pledges to daylight 1,000 intersections yearly, but no full safety analysis exists.

The pilot, announced by Mayor Adams, opened its first station in Cooper Square. The matter summary states the pilot 'aims to improve the safety of recharging lithium-ion batteries and counter the demonization of e-bikes.' Mayor Adams led the announcement, stating, 'delivery workers should be able to count on the city for fair pay and safer jobs.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We’re going to be working to address any area where we can make an improvement.' Three companies—Swobbee, Popwheels, and Swiftmile—operate the FDNY-reviewed stations. The pilot brings 102 charging points, slightly more than the city’s first round of electric car chargers. Plans for more locations are in motion, but e-bike infrastructure still trails behind car-focused projects.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City lags on e-bike infrastructure, but pushes forward.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2024, NYC DOT launched a public e-bike charging pilot for delivery workers. The pilot, part of the 'Charge Safe Ride Safe Action Plan,' opened its first station in Cooper Square. The program, highlighted by Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33), offers 102 charging points for 100 delivery workers, many of them immigrants, at no cost. Three companies—Swobbee, Popwheels, and Swiftmile—operate the FDNY-reviewed stations. The official summary states the pilot 'aims to improve the safety of recharging lithium-ion batteries and counter the demonization of e-bikes.' Mayor Adams said, 'This pilot program ... will give delivery workers the ability to access safe, accessible, outdoor battery-charging that will undoubtedly save lives.' The city faces delays and pushback on e-bike infrastructure, with faster progress for electric cars. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We’re going to be working to address any area where we can make an improvement.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders face dead batteries, empty docks, and mounting frustration. The city promised a pilot last year. Still, the streets wait. The delay leaves e-bike users stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On February 29, 2024, Council Member Erik Bottcher called out the Department of Transportation and Con Edison for failing to deliver electrified Citi Bike docks in his Manhattan district. The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
