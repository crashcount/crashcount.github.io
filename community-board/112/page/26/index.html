Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brewer questioned the decision, stating, 'It is bewildering how you end up with a $1.3 million settlement... and then you get a new contract for more than $300 million.' The city comptroller’s office reviewed the settlement before approval.

The program, mandated by a 2021 law, will run for three years in two phases. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'These hubs will help better organize last-mile deliveries and support small and large businesses’ economic recovery.' The hubs will be chosen for proximity to bike lanes, truck routes, and transit, with community input. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers backed the plan, citing the need to reduce truck traffic and its deadly toll. Brooks-Powers noted, 'Every year roughly 1,400 lives are lost prematurely because of preventable air pollution exacerbated by the explosion of local truck traffic.' The council leadership supports the initiative as a move toward sustainable, safer streets for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states: 'DOT crews laid down four blocks of 'double-lane' protected bike lane on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan this week, debuting a 'passing lane' design officials plan to rollout later this year at locations across the city.' Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Wider bike lanes can make cycling more comfortable and social, encouraging the amazing growth we've seen in cycling and e-micromobility use.' The new design features a six-foot bike lane with a four-foot passing lane, separated from parked cars by an eight-foot buffer. DOT will monitor the pilot to guide future installations.

He commended DOT for swift action but transparency is lacking. Holden has opposed Citi Bike expansion and the Streets Master Plan, but supports NYPD enforcement against illegal parking and some safety improvements.

The program will allow large trucks to unload at designated hubs, shifting the final delivery leg to vans, cargo bikes, or carts. Details on locations and management are pending. After a year, DOT will review data and consider expansion, with a final report due in 2026.

The city offered a curb extension, not a stop light. Over 30,000 demanded more. Parents and advocates called for real change: plazas, enforcement, protection. The city’s answer fell short. The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2023, after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun, the city faced pressure to act on Newtown Road. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, refused to commit to a stop light, promising only to study the site and add a curb extension. The matter, described as 'significant street safety improvements,' drew outrage. Over 30,000 signed a petition for a stop light. Community voices—Dolma’s family, local parents, advocates—demanded more: pedestrian plazas, Open Streets, enforcement. Sarah Chu said, 'And if the family wants a stop light, just give it to them.' Ivana Bologna called for ticketing drivers. The city’s limited response, with only signage and paint, was widely seen as inadequate. Advocates insisted on physical changes to protect lives, not half-measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
