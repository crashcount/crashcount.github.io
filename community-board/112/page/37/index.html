Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation cut Jamaica Avenue’s busway hours from 24/7 to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, while Archer Avenue remains round-the-clock. The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>On November 10, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation proposed making Grand Army Plaza car-free and connecting it to Open Streets on Vanderbilt and Underhill Avenues. The matter, described as 'NYC DOT proposal for car-free Grand Army Plaza and related street safety improvements,' is not a formal council bill but has drawn council attention. Council Member Shahana Hanif (District 39) and Crystal Hudson pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to address the plaza’s 'endless traffic, poor sidewalk conditions, broken benches, and overflowing trash cans.' Hanif and Hudson demanded immediate safety upgrades after recent crashes injured pedestrians and cyclists. DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton said, 'We want to take it to the next level... more consistent and better designed public spaces.' The agency is seeking public feedback and plans to draft detailed designs within the year. The proposal aims to end the status quo of danger and disrepair, prioritizing vulnerable road users over cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
