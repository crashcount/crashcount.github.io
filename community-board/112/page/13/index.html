Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The program, launched in March, ran for six months and involved 118 delivery workers. According to DOT, 'the pilot illustrated the strong demand for safe and accessible outdoor e-bike charging.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'Safer charging practices are integral to a cleaner and more sustainable future.' The pilot cut home charging by 35% and halved spare battery use. DOT will expand the program with 173 new charging hubs near 53 NYCHA complexes, funded by a $25 million federal grant. The next phase will open facilities to NYCHA residents and the public, aiming for up to 1,000 battery-swap stations in two years.

Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On November 20, 2024, the Central Park Conservancy released a study proposing protected bike lanes on the park’s four crosstown transverses—66th, 79th, 86th, and 96th Streets—starting with both directions on 86th. The study, endorsed by the Conservancy and supported by the Department of Transportation, recommends reducing vehicle lanes to expand space for cyclists. The matter title reads: "Central Park Study Calls for Bike Lanes on the Transverses." The report also suggests a two-way protected lane on Fifth Avenue, converting Central Park West’s lane to two-way, and adding protected crosstown lanes on 59th and 110th. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "These recommendations will update the park's drives to prioritize pedestrian safety while also better accommodating cyclists and legal e-mobility options." Advocates and city officials point to past deaths, like Daniel Cammerman’s in 2019, as evidence of urgent need. The plan aims to shield the most vulnerable from harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event marked the completion of protected bike lanes along nearly the entire corridor, except for one block. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Several elements of this redesign aim at enhancing safety for all road users: Curbside bike lanes to enhance cyclist safety, pedestrian islands to shorten crossing distances while encouraging slower, safe turns, and additional adjustments to traffic signal timing to allow more time for pedestrians to cross before the lights turn green." The project, begun in 2015 under Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced local opposition and political delays but persisted. The city reports a 68 percent drop in traffic fatalities and a 35 percent reduction in pedestrian injuries since the redesign began. Cyclist numbers surged by 450 percent. DOT plans to upgrade bike lanes with concrete, but mountable curbs could leave lanes exposed to cars. Families for Safe Streets activist Lizi Rahman called the redesign a model for dangerous roads everywhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Improper lane usage by the sedan contributed to the crash.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a sedan and a bicycle collided on Broadway near West 204 Street in Manhattan at 16:10. The sedan was traveling straight south when it struck the bicyclist, who was also going straight ahead. The bicyclist, a 28-year-old male wearing a helmet, was ejected and sustained injuries to his elbow, lower arm, and hand, with minor bleeding and shock reported. The report cites 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as a contributing factor on the part of the sedan driver. The bicyclist's confusion is noted as a secondary contributing factor, but the primary driver error was the sedan's improper lane usage. No damage was reported to either vehicle. The focus remains on the sedan driver's failure to maintain proper lane discipline, which led to the collision and injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
