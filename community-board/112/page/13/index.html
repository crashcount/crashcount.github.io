Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Concrete upgrades loom, but mountable curbs may let cars intrude.</p><p class=mb3>On November 13, 2024, the Department of Transportation celebrated a decade of safety improvements on Queens Boulevard. The event marked the completion of protected bike lanes along nearly the entire corridor, except for one block. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Several elements of this redesign aim at enhancing safety for all road users: Curbside bike lanes to enhance cyclist safety, pedestrian islands to shorten crossing distances while encouraging slower, safe turns, and additional adjustments to traffic signal timing to allow more time for pedestrians to cross before the lights turn green." The project, begun in 2015 under Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced local opposition and political delays but persisted. The city reports a 68 percent drop in traffic fatalities and a 35 percent reduction in pedestrian injuries since the redesign began. Cyclist numbers surged by 450 percent. DOT plans to upgrade bike lanes with concrete, but mountable curbs could leave lanes exposed to cars. Families for Safe Streets activist Lizi Rahman called the redesign a model for dangerous roads everywhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city left the southernmost block, between Hanson Place and Lafayette Avenue, without a protected bike lane. As activists from Transportation Alternatives wrote, this block 'does not work for anyone on the street and is the missing link in an otherwise protected bike lane.' Council members are not named, but the campaign targets Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Residents supported the full plan, but the city caved to real estate and institutional pressure, keeping two-way car traffic and exposing cyclists to danger. Crash data shows injuries persist.
