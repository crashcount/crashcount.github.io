Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

New mid-block crossings, concrete islands, and curb extensions aim to slow cars and protect people. Local leaders call it overdue. For years, crashes haunted this corridor. Now, the city moves to put people before traffic.</p><p class=mb3>On July 26, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced major street safety upgrades for Atlantic Avenue in District 33. The project, led by NYC DOT, brings mid-block crossings, concrete pedestrian islands, curb enhancements, and split-phase signals to one of Brooklyn’s deadliest corridors. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push. Local officials and advocates say these changes mark a crucial step in ending the street’s legacy of danger and death.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the automated enforcement programs 'key to our Vision Zero efforts to save lives on our streets.' The RFP seeks to leverage new camera technology to address the surge in hidden plates and ensure stronger oversight. New equipment is expected by August 2025.

Both vehicles were making right turns at impact.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred on Vermilyea Avenue near Dyckman Street in Manhattan around midnight. The collision involved a 2016 Honda taxi and a 2023 moped, both traveling northwest and making right turns. The point of impact was the taxi's right front bumper and the moped's left front quarter panel. The moped driver, a 21-year-old male, was injured with abrasions to his knee, lower leg, and foot but was conscious and not ejected. The report explicitly cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the contributing factor, indicating the taxi driver failed to obey traffic signals or signs. No other contributing factors or victim behaviors were noted. The taxi driver was licensed and operating legally, but the failure to yield or obey traffic control led to this collision and injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

She said, "If we're seeing that these stations aren't being used adequately ... is there another option, can we make the docks smaller?" The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, defended the current system. Bike-share experts like David Eddington countered that full docks signal popularity, not neglect. Citi Bike General Manager Patrick Knoth explained that point-in-time observations mislead, as ridership is strong and docks are planned based on trends. Citi Bike usage in Stevens's district rose 48 percent from 2022 to 2023, with most riders using reduced fares. The hearing highlighted the need for a comprehensive, accessible bike-share network, especially as e-bikes make hilly areas more reachable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move targets deadly corners where cars block sightlines. Sixteen community boards and dozens of officials back it. DOT drags its feet. Advocates demand action.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon introduced a bill to end New York City's exemption from the state law banning parking within 20 feet of intersections. The bill, now under consideration, has strong support: sixteen community boards and over three dozen elected officials have signed on. The measure aims to remove parked cars from corners, a practice called 'daylighting,' to improve visibility and cut intersection crashes. Simon called it a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez has voiced concerns that daylighting could lead to faster, more dangerous turns, but advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans counter that daylighting is 'proven and widely popular.' The DOT missed a deadline for a daylighting safety study but claims it will daylight 1,000 intersections this year. Advocates urge the city to follow the law and protect vulnerable road users at every intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Stockholm did it. Manhattan could have. Hochul stopped it. Pedestrians and cyclists lost. The city stays loud, crowded, and dangerous. The promise of safer streets remains unkept.</p><p class=mb3>This media commentary, published June 24, 2024, examines the halted launch of congestion pricing in Manhattan. The article, titled 'Hey, Gov. Hochul, Here’s How Congestion Pricing Would Have Remade Manhattan,' draws a sharp contrast between New York and Stockholm, where a similar policy removed 20 percent of cars and reclaimed public space for people. The piece criticizes Governor Hochul’s decision to cancel congestion pricing, arguing it denies New Yorkers the safety and freedom seen in Stockholm’s pedestrianized, business-friendly streets. The commentary features voices like Clarence Eckerson and Lars Strömgren, highlighting the benefits for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and children—who thrive when cars are fewer. The article underscores the lost opportunity for safer, calmer streets and improved transit, with no council member or bill number attached, but a clear call for systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
