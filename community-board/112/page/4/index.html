Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash happened around 10:10 a.m. on Broome Street near Centre Street. The van driver told the outlet, "I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident." The collision forced the cyclist into the path of a red delivery truck, which then struck him. The 54-year-old truck driver stayed at the scene. Police had not determined if charges would be filed. The article highlights the lethal risk of dooring and the vulnerability of cyclists in mixed traffic. The incident underscores systemic dangers at curbside and the consequences of inattentive door opening.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Patrick Hendry of the Police Benevolent Association claimed officers "lost sight of the car and did not know it crashed," but the family's attorney, Jeremy Feigenbaum, said their investigation "has not corroborated the officers' claim."

The program opened three delivery hubs at Amsterdam Avenue at 85th Street, Amsterdam at 73rd Street, and Broadway at 77th Street. According to the DOT, these hubs are part of a three-year pilot under the Curb Management Action Plan. The official matter summary states: 'The DOT unveiled three new microhubs to promote cleaner, greener, last-mile deliveries.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, applauded the initiative, saying, 'It is incredibly important to have these hubs where we can pull the trucks off the streets and get the delivery via bicycle.' The pilot aims to cut truck congestion, reduce double parking, and shift deliveries to low-emission modes. Delivery giants like Amazon and UPS will use the hubs. The city hopes to make streets safer for everyone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On April 11, 2025, the City Council passed Intro 1105 and Intro 1114. Both bills require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create public trackers for capital projects tied to the Streets Master Plan. Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.

Sunlight on every mile.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 1105-2024, now on the Mayor's desk, came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced November 13, 2024, and passed committee and full Council votes on April 10, 2025. The law, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to tracking progress made towards the requirements of the streets master plan,' demands the Department of Transportation post annual and monthly updates on all benchmark projects—protected bike lanes, bus lanes, signals, and upgrades. Council Member Julie Won led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Ayala, and others. The law requires public reporting on project status, funding, delays, and overruns. This measure brings hard oversight and transparency to the city’s street safety promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, handled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced February 28, 2024. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to conduct a comprehensive Environmental Impact Study on the viability of the proposed QueensLink project.' Council Member Robert F. Holden led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Ariola, Banks, Joseph, Gennaro, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. All committee members voted 'affirmative.' The QueensLink would restore 3.5 miles of dormant rail, linking northern and southern Queens, and could serve tens of thousands daily. The Council demands a full study before any track is laid, seeking facts on impact, cost, and safety for all who move through Queens.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
