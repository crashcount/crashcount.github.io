Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation seeks a contractor to install technology that fines drivers who pass stopped buses. The state legalized these cameras in 2019. The City Council, led by then-Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez, passed a law in early 2022 for a six-month pilot and required annual reporting. The city enacted automated fine rules in November. Advocates, including Transportation Alternatives, praised the move: 'We know changes like this can save lives.' Suffolk County saw a 42-percent drop in violations after similar cameras. The Adams administration questioned the program's impact, noting no deaths from bus arm violations since 2014. The city has not published pilot results.

The official summary states: 'The addition of a parking-protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue will create a critical cycling link...while making the road safer for everyone.' Ossé, who previously criticized DOT delays, said, 'This project is a win for everyone.' The lane will address a Vision Zero Priority Corridor with five pedestrian deaths and nearly 400 crashes since 2019.

Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On August 29, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a record 71 school streets will close to cars this fall. The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not yet assigned a bill number, is led by Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The plan aims to make Park Avenue 'greener, safer and more welcoming,' but leaves out key details: 'All ideas are welcome,' Rodriguez said, refusing to commit to a protected bike lane. Rep. Jerry Nadler voiced support for sustainable transit, including Citi Bike. Advocates like Jon Orcutt highlighted the lack of bike lanes in the area, calling for urgent action. The Request for Proposals is open for four weeks to women and minority-owned firms, with public input to follow.

The incident occurred at 16:15 when a 2018 Ford SUV, traveling north and making a left turn, struck her with its left front bumper. The pedestrian was crossing with the signal, but the driver failed to yield right-of-way and was inattentive, contributing to the collision. The pedestrian sustained abrasions and injuries to her elbow, lower arm, and hand but remained conscious. The report explicitly identifies 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The vehicle damage was limited to the left front bumper. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally, but his errors caused harm to a vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>The Fourth Avenue ‘Great Street’ capital project, first announced in 2017, faces another setback. The Department of Transportation (DOT) told Community Board 7 that Phase I, meant to bolster medians and add plantings, will now finish in August 2025—over a year late. Phase II, which would add concrete to painted bike zones, won’t start until 2026. DOT erased protected bike lanes during construction, forcing cyclists into traffic. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez admitted waiving Local Law 124, which requires temporary bike lanes, citing traffic concerns. Community Board 7, led by Katherine Walsh, called out DOT’s failure to address illegal parking and equity. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and John Tomac condemned the agency’s logic and lack of safety measures. Despite the $60-million Vision Zero promise, Brooklyn’s vulnerable road users remain exposed as the city delays real protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Paint and ticket blitzes failed. Bus speeds barely moved. Riders remain stuck in traffic. Cars clog lanes. Promised fixes scrapped. Advocates demand real action. The city stalls. Riders suffer.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2024, MTA officials sent a scathing letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, criticizing the city’s decision to abandon plans to upgrade Fordham Road’s curbside bus lanes to offset bus lanes. The letter, signed by outgoing NYCT President Richard Davey and interim successor Demetrius Crichlow, called the city’s paint-and-enforcement approach a 'total bust.' The MTA cited new data showing bus speeds increased just 2–4 percent since October 2022—far below the 15 percent target. The matter summary reads: 'The Fordham Road project enjoys widespread support from transit advocacy groups, and Fordham Road bus riders, who have been enduring slow service for decades.' Council involvement is not specified, but the MTA’s letter and Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein both demand stronger measures. The city’s inaction leaves Bronx bus riders stranded in slow traffic, with vulnerable road users paying the price for political compromise.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity,' was introduced April 11, 2024. It passed committee and full council votes on August 15, 2024, and became law September 14, 2024, as Local Law 88 of 2024. Council Members Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, Lynn C. Schulman, Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, and others backed the measure. The law compels DOT to publish monthly and annual data on bike and micromobility use, including counts from automated sensors. DOT must also describe safety projects and analyze crash and usage data to guide improvements. This law forces transparency. It puts the movement and safety of vulnerable riders on record.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
