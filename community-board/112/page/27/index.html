Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Data expert Jehiah Czebotar noted that most vehicles caught speeding do not receive a second ticket and urged state legislators to permanently authorize automated enforcement of all traffic rules and expand red-light camera programs.

Critics say low fees fuel car ownership, crowding out transit, bikes, and green space. Experts warn it’s a subsidy for drivers, not a fix for congestion or emissions.</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2023, a Senate proposal surfaced to create a Residential Parking Permit system in New York City. The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets meant for people, not freight.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2023, NYC DOT floated a plan to build a temporary highway through Brooklyn Heights during the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) rebuild. The agency outlined two options: diverting traffic onto local streets or constructing a bypass road. The matter, described as 'a controversial possibility reminiscent of an earlier plan,' sparked outrage. Assembly Member Robert Carroll slammed the idea of sending trucks onto residential blocks as 'insane.' Lara Birnback of the Brooklyn Heights Association called the plan disruptive and wasteful. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez highlighted public calls for 'safer bike and pedestrian connections' and new green space. No bill number or committee was cited. The plan remains a proposal, with no set price or location. Vulnerable road users face increased risk if trucks flood neighborhood streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City workers made minor fixes. Council members demanded daylighting and real barriers. DOT resisted, citing flexibility. Advocates want curb extensions. The city’s slow action leaves streets deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On February 24, 2023, Council Members Julie Won, Tiffany Cabán, and Selvena Brooks-Powers sent a letter to the Department of Transportation (DOT) after a driver killed Dolma Naadhun. They demanded daylighting, neckdowns, speed bumps, stop signs, and reflective markings at Newtown Road intersections. The lawmakers wrote, “Nothing can bring back Dolma Naadhun, but we can prevent further loss of life so that no family must experience the loss of a loved one.” DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed a Council bill mandating 100 daylighted intersections per year, arguing for flexibility and physical infrastructure in daylit spaces. Advocates and experts agree: daylighting without barriers is flawed. They call for curb extensions to slow drivers and protect people. Residents remain frustrated by the city’s slow, limited response after repeated deaths and injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
