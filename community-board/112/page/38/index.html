The pain fills it.</p><p><strong>Twelve people have died here since 2022.</strong> Hundreds more were hurt. The city logged 4,360 crashes in this board’s bounds. Pedestrians took 456 injuries. Cyclists took 258. The numbers come from the city’s own database and our rollups.</p><h3 id=broadway-and-the-parkway-keep-taking>Broadway and the Parkway keep taking</h3><p>BROADWAY leads the injury list with 277 people hurt and one death. HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY shows 222 injuries and three deaths. Those are the top hot spots in CB12’s data. See the city’s crash feed for the cases.</p><p>A crash on the Henry Hudson at 2:25 a.m. killed two people and hurt another, according to the city’s record of <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4750210</a>. Four vehicles. Two dead at the scene. The file lists a pickup “demolished.”</p><p>On FORT GEORGE AVE and AUDUBON, a 25‑year‑old motorcycle rider was ejected and killed at 9:44 p.m., per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4743277</a>.</p><p>On WEST 181 STREET, a 37‑year‑old bicyclist died at 3:57 a.m. after striking a parked tractor trailer, the city’s log says in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4729767</a>.</p><h3 id=nights-are-loud-with-sirens>Nights are loud with sirens</h3><p>Injuries pile up after dark. Between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m., the hours with the most recorded deaths were 2 a.m. (three), 3 a.m. (one), 4 a.m. (two), 9 p.m. (one), 10 p.m. (one), and 5 p.m.–6 p.m.–7 p.m.–8 p.m.–9 p.m. all show heavy injury counts. At 6 p.m., injuries spike to 136 with ten serious. That is the peak for severe harm in this dataset.</p><h3 id=speed-inattention-and-a-red-light-run>Speed, inattention, and a red light run</h3><p>“Unsafe speed” shows up in the fatal moped crash on SAINT NICHOLAS AVE and WEST 185 STREET. A 15‑year‑old was killed. The city’s file cites speed and a traffic control disregard in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4678005</a>.</p><p>Across CB12’s rollup, “failure to yield,” “unsafe speed,” “inattention,” and “disregarded traffic control” appear as contributing factors. Five deaths sit under “other/unspecified” in the city’s summaries. We don’t get answers there. Only bodies.</p><h3 id=trucks-suvs-and-the-human-cost>Trucks, SUVs, and the human cost</h3><p>SUVs and cars account for most pedestrian harm here, with 396 recorded pedestrian injury cases tied to them in the rollup. Trucks and buses appear less often, but when they do, the damage is heavy. One parked tractor trailer is the last thing a rider saw on West 181st.</p><h3 id=fix-the-blocks-we-know-are-deadly>Fix the blocks we know are deadly</h3><p>Start where the data points. Harden turns and add daylighting on BROADWAY’s worst stretches. Add protected space and signal priority for walkers and riders at the ramps feeding HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY. Put truck loading where it does not force a human into a live lane on WEST 181 STREET. These are standard tools the city already uses.</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-are-on-the-table>Citywide tools are on the table</h3><p>Albany renewed the 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, according to <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>. That program is now law through 2030, the report says. The Senate and Assembly votes from local lawmakers are on the record in our timeline.</p><p>The state is also moving a bill to force speed‑limiters on repeat violators. In the Senate, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> advanced with yes votes from local Senator Robert Jackson in June 2025. In the Assembly, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a> has co‑sponsors from uptown. The bill would require intelligent speed assistance after repeated violations.</p><p>NYC now has the power to lower speeds. Sammy’s Law gave the city authority, and the Council and DOT have begun to use it in places. Our own action page explains how to press for a 20 mph default and the speed‑limiter bills. Slower cars mean fewer funerals.</p><h3 id=no-comfort-in-the-ledger>No comfort in the ledger</h3><p>CB12 shows zero recorded deaths year‑to‑date, but the bodies since 2022 are still on our streets. Two at 2:25 a.m. on the Parkway. A teen on St. Nicholas. A rider on 181st. One death on Sherman. The ledger keeps their times. The corners stay the same.</p><p>Take one step: tell City Hall and Albany to slow the traffic and end the repeat speeding. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>Quotes on record:</p><ul><li>“As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection…” — DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez on Canal Street upgrades (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>).</li><li>“A Chinatown intersection where two people were killed last month… will be getting upgrades to improve safety.” — <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</li><li>“Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year.” — DOT Commissioner Rodriguez, via <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>BKReader</a>.</li></ul></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

She called the agency’s excuses garbage. Cyclists and walkers remain squeezed into a narrow, dangerous path. DOT’s delays keep vulnerable road users at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On September 15, 2022, Council Member Julie Won publicly criticized the Department of Transportation for delaying the conversion of the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway into a pedestrian-only lane. The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They wrote to Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, stating, 'Every year, we see how much New Yorkers enjoy the car-free street and associated activities, and we are writing to ask you to bring this beloved event to our respective boroughs in 2023.' The Department of Transportation said it would review the request. Advocates like Juan Restrepo and Jackson Chabot joined the call, demanding more hours and borough-wide access. Community groups stressed the benefits for families and children. The program is described as cost-effective, crime-free, and vital for community building. No formal council bill or vote yet, but the push is clear: open streets for all, not just Manhattan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City promises more, but kids keep facing danger.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published September 8, 2022, reviews Mayor Adams’s progress on school street safety. In eight months, the administration completed only 28 street redesigns near schools, out of 2,600 citywide. The Department of Transportation has 24 more projects underway. The matter summary states: 'the city's relatively minor investment in street safety upgrades will do little to mitigate the threats cars pose to children walking to and from city schools.' Council members and advocates, including Emily Stutts and Danny Harris, criticize the slow pace. Stutts says, 'It doesn’t feel like enough,' while Harris urges, 'Mayor Adams and DOT need to expand this program now to save lives.' The city expanded school-zone speed cameras to 24/7 and increased open streets for schools to 47, but this covers only a fraction of schools. Advocates demand aggressive Vision Zero action, citing rising child fatalities and persistent danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states the law was 'an innovative way to further our goal of promoting street safety.' Powers urged the mayor and DOT to act. Despite evidence from other cities and strong support from advocates like StreetsPAC and Transportation Alternatives, City Hall cited a lack of recent deaths and continued to evaluate the program. The Council bill permitted, but did not require, the enforcement program. Advocates argue the city is missing a proven tool to hold reckless drivers accountable and keep children safe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, sponsored by then-Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez and co-sponsored by Keith Powers, empowers the city to install cameras to catch drivers who illegally pass stopped school buses. On September 7, 2022, Mayor Adams’s administration chose not to implement the program, citing ongoing evaluation and a lack of recent deaths from such incidents. Council Member Powers urged the mayor and DOT to use this tool, calling it 'an innovative way to further our goal of promoting street safety.' Activists from StreetsPAC and Transportation Alternatives criticized the delay, noting that streets near schools are especially dangerous for children, particularly in Black and brown neighborhoods. Evidence from other cities shows stop-arm cameras catch hundreds of violations quickly. The law leaves the program to mayoral discretion. City Hall supports speed cameras but has not acted on stop-arm enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, claimed, "the future of New York City is reimagining the use of public space."

Council Member Keith Powers, representing the district, said, "I would love something more interesting here than parking," and called for renewed discussion on a permanent outdoor dining program.
