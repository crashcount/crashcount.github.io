Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Now, longer cargo bikes roll legal. Four-wheelers, capped at 15 mph, can haul freight. Trucks choke streets and kill. Cargo bikes offer a safer, cleaner way. Industry pushed. DOT listened. Streets change. Pedestrians and cyclists breathe easier.</p><p class=mb3>On March 27, 2024, the NYC Department of Transportation finalized new cargo bike rules after months of industry pushback. The rules, shaped by public comment, allow pedal-assist cargo bikes up to four feet wide and 192 inches long, with four wheels, and set a 15 mph speed cap. The original proposal would have banned most existing cargo bike-trailer setups with a 120-inch limit. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez promised to get it right. Mark Chiusano, CEO of Net Zero Logistics, praised the fix: "They did a really good job of fixing the original version and made good on their word." Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi said, "We are accommodating this change in consumer culture—encouraging environmental package delivery, away from cars and trucks." Ben Morris of Coaster Cycles warned the old cap would have wiped out the market. DOT's move aims to cut truck traffic, which causes 12% of pedestrian and 30% of cyclist deaths. The new rules create a legal path for safer, greener freight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 37-year-old male driver of one SUV was injured, sustaining a shoulder-upper arm injury and contusions. The report identifies 'Pavement Slippery' as a contributing factor for all involved vehicles. Additionally, the injured driver was noted for 'Following Too Closely,' a critical driver error that likely precipitated the crash. All drivers were licensed and traveling straight ahead at the time of impact. The collision points included the left front quarter panel, right front bumper, and center front end of the vehicles. The injured driver was restrained with a lap belt and remained conscious but was not ejected from the vehicle. The report does not list any victim behaviors as contributing factors, focusing instead on driver errors and hazardous road conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Twenty-nine dead last year. Highest ever. Reckless drivers surge post-pandemic. City report demands more cameras—jump from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Officials back the bill. Victims’ families demand action. Cameras cut crashes. But the most dangerous drivers remain loose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2024, the Department of Transportation released a report urging passage of a bill to expand New York City’s red-light camera program. The bill, supported by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and sponsored by State Senator Andrew Goundardes, would boost camera coverage from 150 to 1,325 intersections—about 10% of the city’s 13,700 signals. The report states: “Expanding the number of intersections with red light cameras... could substantially enhance the deterrent effect of the program and return New York City to the consistently downward trend of red light-running behavior we had seen prior to the pandemic.” Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz also supports expansion, calling for cameras at every intersection. The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains. Relatives of crash victims joined the call, demanding the city confront driver negligence and protect the community.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rajkumar’s bill drew immediate opposition from delivery workers. Gustavo Ajche of Los Deliveristas Unidos said, 'We're deeply disappointed to see local and state leaders introduce legislation that would put the burden of penalty on delivery workers rather than trying to regulate the app companies.'

The report cites the driver’s inattention and distraction as contributing factors, along with driver inexperience. The driver held a permit license, indicating limited driving experience. The pedestrian’s crossing with the signal was noted but not listed as a contributing factor. Vehicle damage was concentrated at the center front end, consistent with the point of impact.

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2024, ten New York City community boards endorsed a citywide ban on parking at intersections—a practice called daylighting. The boards urge the city to stop exempting itself from state law requiring no parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. The resolution follows fatal crashes involving children at poorly visible corners. The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data. DOT pledges to daylight 1,000 intersections yearly, but no full safety analysis exists. Boards and advocates say the city’s pace leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Adams led the announcement, stating, 'delivery workers should be able to count on the city for fair pay and safer jobs.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We’re going to be working to address any area where we can make an improvement.' Three companies—Swobbee, Popwheels, and Swiftmile—operate the FDNY-reviewed stations. The pilot brings 102 charging points, slightly more than the city’s first round of electric car chargers.
