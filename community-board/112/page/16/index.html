Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city now allows roadside dining only from April to November, with just 1,315 restaurants applying for street setups. Another 1,277 sought year-round sidewalk cafes. The matter, described as a 'massive scaleback,' drew criticism from advocates and business owners. Jackson Chabot of Open Plans said, 'It’s mind boggling that New York City is actually regressing back to more car-centered streets.' Restaurateurs like Charlotta Janssen and Robert Sanfiz warned that new seasonal rules and costly storage will force many to abandon outdoor dining. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the program 'the largest and best in America,' but critics say the city missed a chance to reclaim space from cars and support vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Only 1,300 restaurants applied for permits, compared to 12,500 during the pandemic. The City Council and Mayor Adams changed the law, allowing roadway dining only seasonally. Eateries must set up each March and tear down by December, a heavy lift for small businesses. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, issued a 'last call' for applications. Rodriguez said, 'Outdoor dining enriches our communities, and we're excited to make it a permanent feature of New York City streets.' Yet, only 23 roadway setups are pending approval. Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans argue the city should allow year-round use, calling the decline a missed opportunity for public space and safety. The new design rules—no roofs or sides—leave some owners feeling exposed and unsafe. The city’s move shifts space back to cars, shrinking safe zones for pedestrians and diners.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, led by NYC DOT, brings mid-block crossings, concrete pedestrian islands, curb enhancements, and split-phase signals to one of Brooklyn’s deadliest corridors. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push.

The program, managed by DOT, is the largest in the nation for speeding, red light, and bus lane violations. The RFP follows a city comptroller report showing Verra Mobility, the current contractor, rejected 41.5% of photos—often due to obscured or defaced license plates—costing the city over $100 million in lost fines. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the automated enforcement programs 'key to our Vision Zero efforts to save lives on our streets.' The RFP seeks to leverage new camera technology to address the surge in hidden plates and ensure stronger oversight. New equipment is expected by August 2025. Verra may reapply, but DOT wants a vendor who can catch more dangerous drivers and keep enforcement strong.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She sees full docks, asks if they should shrink. Experts fire back: full docks mean high use. Ridership surges. DOT stands firm. Bike-share stays. Riders keep moving.</p><p class=mb3>At a May 8, 2024, City Council oversight hearing, Council Member Althea Stevens questioned the need for a Citi Bike dock in her South Bronx district. She said, "If we're seeing that these stations aren't being used adequately ... is there another option, can we make the docks smaller?" The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, defended the current system. Bike-share experts like David Eddington countered that full docks signal popularity, not neglect. Citi Bike General Manager Patrick Knoth explained that point-in-time observations mislead, as ridership is strong and docks are planned based on trends. Citi Bike usage in Stevens's district rose 48 percent from 2022 to 2023, with most riders using reduced fares. The hearing highlighted the need for a comprehensive, accessible bike-share network, especially as e-bikes make hilly areas more reachable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
