Two people died. Seven hundred were hurt. Fourteen suffered injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting in hospital halls.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit her, and ran. The police checked the victim, then left. The car was abandoned. The driver vanished. A neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> The street is a gauntlet. The pain is routine.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill>Patterns That Kill</h2><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> It is built into the streets. In the last year, people ages 18 to 34 bore the brunt: over 300 injuries, two deaths. Children and elders are not spared. The most common killers are cars and SUVs, responsible for three deaths and 14 serious injuries in the last three years. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes have left their own scars, but the weight of harm comes from the largest machines.</p><p>The cycle repeats. A man is hit. A woman is left bleeding. A child is struck. The city moves on. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem,&rdquo;</a> said a man named Jordan. The intersection stays the same.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Robert Jackson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. Assembly Member Manny De Los Santos <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored</a> the same. Both voted to extend the city’s speed camera program, a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The streets are still built for speed, not safety. The dead cannot call for change. The living must.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that protect people, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Expansion looms.</p><p class=mb3>On November 25, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced results from its e-bike charging pilot. The program, launched in March, ran for six months and involved 118 delivery workers. According to DOT, 'the pilot illustrated the strong demand for safe and accessible outdoor e-bike charging.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'Safer charging practices are integral to a cleaner and more sustainable future.' The pilot cut home charging by 35% and halved spare battery use. DOT will expand the program with 173 new charging hubs near 53 NYCHA complexes, funded by a $25 million federal grant. The next phase will open facilities to NYCHA residents and the public, aiming for up to 1,000 battery-swap stations in two years. Activists and company leaders praised the safety improvements for delivery workers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety for walkers and riders comes first.</p><p class=mb3>""These recommendations will update the park's drives to prioritize pedestrian safety while also better accommodating cyclists and legal e-mobility options both traveling within the park or through it across Manhattan,"" -- Ydanis A. Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On November 20, 2024, the Central Park Conservancy released a study proposing protected bike lanes on the park’s four crosstown transverses—66th, 79th, 86th, and 96th Streets—starting with both directions on 86th. The study, endorsed by the Conservancy and supported by the Department of Transportation, recommends reducing vehicle lanes to expand space for cyclists. The matter title reads: "Central Park Study Calls for Bike Lanes on the Transverses." The report also suggests a two-way protected lane on Fifth Avenue, converting Central Park West’s lane to two-way, and adding protected crosstown lanes on 59th and 110th. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "These recommendations will update the park's drives to prioritize pedestrian safety while also better accommodating cyclists and legal e-mobility options." Advocates and city officials point to past deaths, like Daniel Cammerman’s in 2019, as evidence of urgent need. The plan aims to shield the most vulnerable from harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event marked the completion of protected bike lanes along nearly the entire corridor, except for one block. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Several elements of this redesign aim at enhancing safety for all road users: Curbside bike lanes to enhance cyclist safety, pedestrian islands to shorten crossing distances while encouraging slower, safe turns, and additional adjustments to traffic signal timing to allow more time for pedestrians to cross before the lights turn green." The project, begun in 2015 under Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced local opposition and political delays but persisted. The city reports a 68 percent drop in traffic fatalities and a 35 percent reduction in pedestrian injuries since the redesign began. Cyclist numbers surged by 450 percent. DOT plans to upgrade bike lanes with concrete, but mountable curbs could leave lanes exposed to cars. Families for Safe Streets activist Lizi Rahman called the redesign a model for dangerous roads everywhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sedan was traveling straight south when it struck the bicyclist, who was also going straight ahead. The bicyclist, a 28-year-old male wearing a helmet, was ejected and sustained injuries to his elbow, lower arm, and hand, with minor bleeding and shock reported. The report cites 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as a contributing factor on the part of the sedan driver. The bicyclist's confusion is noted as a secondary contributing factor, but the primary driver error was the sedan's improper lane usage. No damage was reported to either vehicle. The focus remains on the sedan driver's failure to maintain proper lane discipline, which led to the collision and injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
