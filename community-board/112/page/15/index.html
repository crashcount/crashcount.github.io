Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

The bicyclist, a 35-year-old man, was injured with abrasions to his upper arm and shoulder but was conscious and not ejected from his bike. The report identifies unsafe speed as the contributing factor for the crash. There is no indication that the bicyclist’s behavior or equipment contributed to the collision. The driver’s failure to control speed while turning created a hazardous situation resulting in the bicyclist’s injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Six-month delays block data on deaths, projects, and official emails. The suit says DOT’s blanket stalling breaks the law and hides vital safety information from the public. DOT stays silent.</p><p class=mb3>On September 17, 2024, Streetsblog filed a lawsuit against the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT), alleging systematic violations of the state’s Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). The suit, brought with the Cornell Law School First Amendment Clinic, targets DOT’s practice of imposing uniform six-month delays on nearly all journalist information requests. Streetsblog’s complaint states: “DOT consistently violates the state's Freedom of Information Law by delaying for six months nearly all of the requests for public information from journalists.” The delays affect at least 33 Streetsblog requests since June 2021, including data on pedestrian fatalities and DOT project records. Michael Martin Linhorst, Streetsblog’s attorney, aims to set a precedent to end these blanket delays. DOT declined to comment. The case highlights how bureaucratic stonewalling keeps critical safety data from the public, undermining transparency and accountability for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the driver was inattentive and distracted, and also cites 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor. The narrative confirms the driver 'didn’t see him.' The pedestrian remained conscious after the collision. The police report makes no mention of any pedestrian error or unsafe behavior, emphasizing instead the role of driver inattention and speed.

The project, supported by Councilmember Carmen De La Rosa (District 10), was announced by the NYC Department of Transportation. The matter summary states, 'The improvements... aim to enhance safety for pedestrians and cyclists and provide faster bus service.' De La Rosa, who represents the area, said, 'I've never been so afraid to walk a bridge on foot... it was an accident waiting to happen.' The overhaul separates cyclists and pedestrians from cars with jersey barriers and fences, and adds protected pedestrian paths. Automated cameras will enforce the bus lane. The DOT plans further safety measures, including a leading pedestrian interval at crossings.

City Council Member Chi Oss, who criticized delays, now calls the project "a win for everyone." The plan uses concrete barriers, flex-posts, and painted pedestrian islands to shield vulnerable users. Since 2020, five pedestrians have died on this stretch. The project responds to years of advocacy and high crash rates, aiming to protect walkers and cyclists in a busy, dangerous corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The grant funds a new database merging crash findings from police, ambulance, hospitals, DMV, and DOT. The city will use AI to analyze patterns and improve safety. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez praised the grant, saying, 'This grant will help us save lives by better harnessing new advances in AI technology and more comprehensively analyzing crashes.' $2.4 million will equip city fleet vehicles with 360-degree cameras and AI. Street safety advocates have long called for this comprehensive, public health approach. The city’s Health Department has not updated serious injury or fatality data since 2017, but this grant aims to change that by integrating data across agencies and improving outcomes for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure aimed to catch drivers who ignore bus stop signs, fining them up to $300 per violation. Despite the law, New York City has not implemented the cameras. A six-month pilot on 30 buses ended without public results. Mayor Adams has delayed action, with City Hall offering no timeline. Other New York counties have issued thousands of violations and seen drops in illegal passing. Advocates like Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives call the cameras 'essential' to protect children, noting twelve have died in traffic this year. The city’s inaction leaves kids exposed while other jurisdictions move ahead.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
