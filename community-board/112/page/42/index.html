Two people died. Seven hundred were hurt. Fourteen suffered injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting in hospital halls.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit her, and ran. The police checked the victim, then left. The car was abandoned. The driver vanished. A neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> The street is a gauntlet. The pain is routine.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill>Patterns That Kill</h2><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> It is built into the streets. In the last year, people ages 18 to 34 bore the brunt: over 300 injuries, two deaths. Children and elders are not spared. The most common killers are cars and SUVs, responsible for three deaths and 14 serious injuries in the last three years. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes have left their own scars, but the weight of harm comes from the largest machines.</p><p>The cycle repeats. A man is hit. A woman is left bleeding. A child is struck. The city moves on. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem,&rdquo;</a> said a man named Jordan. The intersection stays the same.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Robert Jackson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. Assembly Member Manny De Los Santos <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored</a> the same. Both voted to extend the city’s speed camera program, a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The streets are still built for speed, not safety. The dead cannot call for change. The living must.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that protect people, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They warned it could push car traffic onto side streets, snarling roads and endangering pedestrians. Most locals walk or ride transit, but opposition remains fierce.</p><p class=mb3>On July 20, 2022, Council Member Oswald Feliz (District 15) publicly opposed a proposed busway for Fordham Road. The matter, described as an 'existential threat' by Bronx business leaders, questions the impact of restricting car traffic on the busy corridor. Feliz, in a letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, acknowledged slow bus speeds but echoed concerns about diverted traffic and business access. The statement reads: 'Closing any portion of Fordham Road to vehicular traffic will result in many negative consequences... creating endless gridlock and danger for pedestrians.' DOT proposals include full or partial busways, but local surveys show 86% of visitors already arrive by walking, bus, or train. Feliz called for a balanced plan, reflecting ongoing tension between business interests and safer, faster transit for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Borelli criticizes DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for announcing a street safety redesign after a fatal crash, calling it 'shameless exploitation.'

The Department of Transportation (DOT) delayed the conversion of the South Outer Roadway to a full-time pedestrian path until at least the end of 2023, citing ongoing bridge repairs. The shared path, only 11 feet wide, is far below DOT’s own safety standards. Injuries have increased as usage soars—nine cyclists hurt in three years, up from three. Julie Won said, "People walking or biking on the shared path are paying with bloody pavement and broken bones, all so the DOT can promote car travel for the few." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the project is a priority, but the city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed. Nine lanes for cars, half a lane each for people.

Advocates demanded action after a crash. Letters went unanswered. The city offered only bureaucracy. Pedestrians remain at risk while officials stall and streets stay open to traffic.</p><p class=mb3>On July 1, 2022, Arthur Piccolo of the Bowling Green Association urged the city to make Lower Broadway car-free on summer Sundays. The proposal, sent to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, cited low vehicle use and the area's attractions. Piccolo argued, 'The automotive quiet creates the perfect opportunity for the administration to prove its commitment to pedestrians.' The city responded only after media inquiry, with DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone stating the proposal is under review as part of the 'Broadway Vision' plan and inviting groups to apply to the Open Streets program. Piccolo dismissed this as 'bureaucratic nonsense.' The Mayor's Office declined comment. The proposal follows renewed calls for pedestrian safety after a serious crash on Broadway. No formal council bill or committee action is noted. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
