The pain fills it.</p><p><strong>Twelve people have died here since 2022.</strong> Hundreds more were hurt. The city logged 4,360 crashes in this board’s bounds. Pedestrians took 456 injuries. Cyclists took 258. The numbers come from the city’s own database and our rollups.</p><h3 id=broadway-and-the-parkway-keep-taking>Broadway and the Parkway keep taking</h3><p>BROADWAY leads the injury list with 277 people hurt and one death. HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY shows 222 injuries and three deaths. Those are the top hot spots in CB12’s data. See the city’s crash feed for the cases.</p><p>A crash on the Henry Hudson at 2:25 a.m. killed two people and hurt another, according to the city’s record of <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4750210</a>. Four vehicles. Two dead at the scene.

Between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m., the hours with the most recorded deaths were 2 a.m. (three), 3 a.m. (one), 4 a.m. (two), 9 p.m. (one), 10 p.m. (one), and 5 p.m.–6 p.m.–7 p.m.–8 p.m.–9 p.m. all show heavy injury counts. At 6 p.m., injuries spike to 136 with ten serious. That is the peak for severe harm in this dataset.</p><h3 id=speed-inattention-and-a-red-light-run>Speed, inattention, and a red light run</h3><p>“Unsafe speed” shows up in the fatal moped crash on SAINT NICHOLAS AVE and WEST 185 STREET. A 15‑year‑old was killed.

Only bodies.</p><h3 id=trucks-suvs-and-the-human-cost>Trucks, SUVs, and the human cost</h3><p>SUVs and cars account for most pedestrian harm here, with 396 recorded pedestrian injury cases tied to them in the rollup. Trucks and buses appear less often, but when they do, the damage is heavy. One parked tractor trailer is the last thing a rider saw on West 181st.</p><h3 id=fix-the-blocks-we-know-are-deadly>Fix the blocks we know are deadly</h3><p>Start where the data points. Harden turns and add daylighting on BROADWAY’s worst stretches. Add protected space and signal priority for walkers and riders at the ramps feeding HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY. Put truck loading where it does not force a human into a live lane on WEST 181 STREET. These are standard tools the city already uses.</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-are-on-the-table>Citywide tools are on the table</h3><p>Albany renewed the 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, according to <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>. That program is now law through 2030, the report says. The Senate and Assembly votes from local lawmakers are on the record in our timeline.</p><p>The state is also moving a bill to force speed‑limiters on repeat violators. In the Senate, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> advanced with yes votes from local Senator Robert Jackson in June 2025. In the Assembly, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a> has co‑sponsors from uptown. The bill would require intelligent speed assistance after repeated violations.</p><p>NYC now has the power to lower speeds. Sammy’s Law gave the city authority, and the Council and DOT have begun to use it in places. Our own action page explains how to press for a 20 mph default and the speed‑limiter bills. Slower cars mean fewer funerals.</p><h3 id=no-comfort-in-the-ledger>No comfort in the ledger</h3><p>CB12 shows zero recorded deaths year‑to‑date, but the bodies since 2022 are still on our streets. Two at 2:25 a.m. on the Parkway. A teen on St. Nicholas. A rider on 181st. One death on Sherman. The ledger keeps their times. The corners stay the same.</p><p>Take one step: tell City Hall and Albany to slow the traffic and end the repeat speeding.

The rule aims to cut truck traffic, clear space for people, and speed up deliveries. Commissioner Rodriguez says cargo bikes mean fewer deadly trucks. Public hearing set for September 13.</p><p class=mb3>On August 14, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a rulemaking to permit four-wheeled, pedal-assist cargo bikes up to 48 inches wide—up from the current three wheels and 36 inches. The proposal, published in the City Record, responds to stalled state legislation and rising delivery demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'Greater use of cargo bikes will bring incredible environmental and safety benefits for New York City by reducing the number of large, high-polluting trucks on our streets.' Rodriguez added, 'Just two cargo bikes can replace one box truck, increasing safety and reducing CO2 emission by 14 tons per year.' The public comment period runs 30 days, with a hearing on September 13. The rule targets safer streets by shrinking the footprint of freight vehicles and clearing the way for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
