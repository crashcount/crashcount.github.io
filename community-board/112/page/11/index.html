Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand more wounded since 2022. The dead include a 15-year-old thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on West 181st, and a man burned alive in a car while police drove away. The streets do not forgive. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed three pedestrians and left over a hundred with moderate or worse injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars, but it is the weight and speed of cars that break bodies most often. The numbers are here, but the pain is not in the numbers. It is in the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-price-of-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Price of Waiting</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. They pass laws, then wait to use them. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stands. The city could act now. It does not. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%</strong>, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>When police chase ends in fire, families are left with questions and ashes. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The officers were suspended. The street stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a>. The help never came. The fire burned for minutes. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day the city delays, more lives are lost.</strong> The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. Residents can call, write, and demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another siren. Do not wait for another name on a list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the city, 'Weigh-in-Motion technology has successfully eliminated 60% of the overweight truck traffic on the Queens bound BQE.' Restler said he hopes for similar results on the Staten Island-bound lanes. The bill authorizing the program is set to expire, prompting calls for urgent legislative action. Rodriguez called the technology a 'national model.' Lawmakers want to expand the system to other sites, including the Washington Bridge.

The DOT called it a 'minor adjustment' to make the street safer for pedestrians and more comfortable for cyclists and drivers. Councilmember Julie Menin (District 5) said, 'We received no communication whatsoever about these very significant changes.' Menin wrote to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, demanding answers and citing a lack of community input. Residents and drivers complained the change slowed cars and let e-bikes speed unchecked. DOT data shows no crash deaths since a 2023 redesign added bike and bus lanes. The move sparked debate over safety, transparency, and the balance between driver convenience and vulnerable road user protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred as the sedan’s right side door was opened directly into the cyclist’s path. The report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The cyclist, a 25-year-old man, was conscious but bleeding heavily from his arm. The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s errors.

A 36-year-old female pedestrian was injured, sustaining contusions and bruises to her shoulder and upper arm. She was conscious at the scene. The report notes no pedestrian fault or contributing factors on her part. Driver errors include failure to maintain control on slippery pavement, leading to the collision with the pedestrian.

The pedestrian was not in the roadway at the time, emphasizing the systemic danger posed by vehicle movements on slippery surfaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Congestion pricing pushed more drivers uptown. Lawmakers say outsiders take local spots. Critics warn permits may spur more car ownership. No clear plan for safety or curb use.</p><p class=mb3>On February 8, 2025, Councilmember Carmen De La Rosa and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine called for a City Council pilot program to restrict street parking to permit holders. The debate follows congestion pricing, which, as the bill summary states, has made free street parking uptown scarce and pushed more drivers into residential neighborhoods. State Senator Robert Jackson sponsors a parallel bill in Albany. De La Rosa and Jackson argue that local residents lose parking to out-of-state drivers. Councilmember Gale Brewer warns that low permit prices could increase car ownership and worsen parking shortages, citing past failures in other cities. Kate Slevin of the Regional Plan Association questions whether a permit system would be enforced, given the city's history of placard abuse. The bill's impact on vulnerable road users remains unaddressed. No safety improvements or curb space repurposing are included.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A sedan traveling south was making a U-turn when it struck a 67-year-old male pedestrian crossing at a marked crosswalk without a signal. The pedestrian sustained injuries to his hip and upper leg and was conscious with contusions and bruises. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factors. The point of impact was the vehicle's left front bumper, indicating the collision happened during the U-turn maneuver. The driver was licensed and operating a 2003 Volkswagen sedan with two occupants. No pedestrian behaviors were listed as contributing factors. This crash highlights the dangers posed by driver errors during complex vehicle maneuvers in pedestrian zones.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
