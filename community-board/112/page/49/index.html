Two people died. Seven hundred were hurt. Fourteen suffered injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting in hospital halls.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit her, and ran. The police checked the victim, then left. The car was abandoned. The driver vanished. A neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> The street is a gauntlet. The pain is routine.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill>Patterns That Kill</h2><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> It is built into the streets. In the last year, people ages 18 to 34 bore the brunt: over 300 injuries, two deaths. Children and elders are not spared. The most common killers are cars and SUVs, responsible for three deaths and 14 serious injuries in the last three years. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes have left their own scars, but the weight of harm comes from the largest machines.</p><p>The cycle repeats. A man is hit. A woman is left bleeding. A child is struck. The city moves on. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem,&rdquo;</a> said a man named Jordan. The intersection stays the same.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Robert Jackson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. Assembly Member Manny De Los Santos <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored</a> the same. Both voted to extend the city’s speed camera program, a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The streets are still built for speed, not safety. The dead cannot call for change. The living must.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that protect people, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A yellow school bus, driven by a 48-year-old man, struck and killed April Reign, a 32-year-old moped rider, near St. Marks Avenue. The driver made a sharp right turn, cut off Reign, knocked her down, and ran her over. He left the scene but later returned after a bystander intervened. No charges were filed at the time. The intersection is notorious for danger, with 487 crashes and 241 injuries reported on this stretch in 2021 alone. Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, called Brooklyn streets 'horrifically deadly for pedestrians and cyclists' and demanded immediate action. Promised safety upgrades—protected bike lanes, intersection redesigns—remain unfulfilled. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

These would allow cyclists to make right turns on red after stopping and to roll through red lights or stop signs at T-intersections when safe. No public hearings are scheduled. Meanwhile, Mayor Adams announced NYPD enforcement of a rule requiring cyclists and drivers to stop and wait for pedestrians at unsignalized crosswalks. Advocates, including Eric McClure of StreetsPAC and Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, criticized the delays. McClure called the changes 'common-sense' and 'safe,' urging DOT to act. The new enforcement rule is seen as targeting cyclists. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the rule would be reconsidered if enforcement is abused.

The Department of Transportation postponed converting the south outer roadway to a pedestrian-only path until December 2023, citing ongoing upper deck repairs. The matter, titled 'City punts fix for ‘treacherous’ Queensboro Bridge bike and pedestrian path by another year,' leaves cyclists and pedestrians sharing a dangerously tight path for another year. Councilmembers Julie Won and Julie Menin urged DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to speed up the process, calling the delay a safety concern. Cycling advocate Laura Shepard criticized the city for prioritizing drivers' comfort over vulnerable road users. DOT insists repairs must finish first.

The project, which would create a dedicated pedestrian path on the bridge’s south outer roadway, is now postponed until the end of 2023 due to deck fabrication issues. Council Members Julie Menin and Julie Won, responding to the delay, stated, 'At least two more years of a shared pedestrian and bike path is not the best outcome for our constituents.' Both called for a meeting with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, who reaffirmed his commitment to the project but offered no clear reason for the holdup. Advocates and community members condemned the delay as a threat to non-car users, citing frequent crashes and near-misses on the narrow shared path.

The initiative, not a council bill but a citywide policy, requires all drivers and cyclists to stop for pedestrians at unsignalized crosswalks. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, a former council member, claims the rule protects pedestrians: 'Pedestrians are the ones that we are so committed to protecting in this particular initiative.' Mayor Adams and NYPD Commissioner Sewell stressed enforcement: warnings will end, compliance will be enforced. Advocates like George Calderaro and Jon Orcutt warn of NYPD bias and a crackdown on cyclists. The plan includes engineering fixes at 1,000 intersections, raised crosswalks, more bike corrals, and a public awareness campaign. Advocacy groups back infrastructure but demand fair enforcement, not targeting cyclists.

Rodriguez said, 'expanding Citi Bike to the underserved community is critical,' but offered few specifics, citing the need for internal review and consultation with the mayor. He acknowledged a 3 percent budget cut but maintained commitment to bike lane protection.

DOT stalls on promised redesign. Bike lane, busway, and pedestrian fixes remain on paper. Local business pressure blocks progress. Community Board 5 approved. Crashes and injuries mount. Council Member Powers urges action. Vulnerable road users wait.</p><p class=mb3>"Powers reiterated that he’s supported the entirety of the plan on Fifth Avenue from the beginning, and wants the Adams administration – and new DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez – to move forward with the bike lane immediately." -- Ydanis A. Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>The Fifth Avenue redesign, announced in 2020 under former Mayor de Blasio, remains stalled as of January 10, 2022. The project, once a bold car-free busway, was scaled back to a protected bike lane and minor pedestrian upgrades. No new bus lane. Community Board 5 approved the plan, but DOT has not started work. Council Member Keith Powers supports the full plan and calls for immediate action on the bike lane, urging the Adams administration and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to move forward. Local business interests, led by the Fifth Avenue Association, oppose the project, citing pandemic recovery concerns. Transportation Alternatives’ Cory Epstein says, 'Busways and bike lanes are good for the economy, good for our climate, and good for our Vision Zero goals.' Since the project’s announcement, crashes and injuries continue on the corridor. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the city delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
