But the blood did not stop. <strong>Thirty-five people were injured in 63 crashes</strong>. Six were hurt badly enough to be counted as serious injuries. The numbers are small. The pain is not. A cyclist thrown from her bike on Eastern Parkway. A pedestrian struck by a bike on Prospect Park West. A moped driver left bleeding on Flatbush Avenue. The wounds are real. The scars last.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Young adults and working-age people take the brunt.</strong> In the past twelve months, the 25–44 age group saw the most injuries. Children were not spared. Two under 18 were hurt. The old are not safe either. A person over 75 was injured. The street does not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Bikes, cars, and mopeds all draw blood.</strong> In the last three years, bikes caused three pedestrian injuries, mopeds one, and cars one. The city <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>counts the wounds</a>. It does not count the fear.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> It claims progress. It points to new speed limits and more cameras. But here, in CB55, the danger remains. No new bills, no bold redesigns, no public stands from local leaders. <strong>The silence is loud.</strong></p><h3 id=the-disaster-that-creeps>The Disaster That Creeps</h3><p>There is no single day of horror. The violence is slow. It comes in the form of a crash every few days. A broken arm. A bleeding head. A life changed. <strong>No one is safe until everyone is safe.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Ask for lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and real enforcement. Do not wait for the next crash. Do not wait for the next name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The move follows a court ruling allowing the change. City Hall claims the redesign addresses 'serious safety concerns.' Legal precedent (Turturro v.

Opponents lost. The message is clear: New Yorkers want safer roads. No new laws yet, but the council’s direction is set. Vulnerable road users watch and wait.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2025, New York City held local elections with major implications for street safety. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
