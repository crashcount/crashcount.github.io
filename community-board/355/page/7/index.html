But the blood did not stop. <strong>Thirty-five people were injured in 63 crashes</strong>. Six were hurt badly enough to be counted as serious injuries. The numbers are small. The pain is not. A cyclist thrown from her bike on Eastern Parkway. A pedestrian struck by a bike on Prospect Park West. A moped driver left bleeding on Flatbush Avenue. The wounds are real. The scars last.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Young adults and working-age people take the brunt.</strong> In the past twelve months, the 25–44 age group saw the most injuries. Children were not spared. Two under 18 were hurt. The old are not safe either. A person over 75 was injured. The street does not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Bikes, cars, and mopeds all draw blood.</strong> In the last three years, bikes caused three pedestrian injuries, mopeds one, and cars one. The city <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>counts the wounds</a>. It does not count the fear.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> It claims progress. It points to new speed limits and more cameras. But here, in CB55, the danger remains. No new bills, no bold redesigns, no public stands from local leaders. <strong>The silence is loud.</strong></p><h3 id=the-disaster-that-creeps>The Disaster That Creeps</h3><p>There is no single day of horror. The violence is slow. It comes in the form of a crash every few days. A broken arm. A bleeding head. A life changed. <strong>No one is safe until everyone is safe.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Ask for lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and real enforcement. Do not wait for the next crash. Do not wait for the next name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets stayed dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On December 3, 2024, six candidates for New York City mayor—Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, and Jim Walden—spoke at a Riders Alliance forum. The event focused on transit policy. Candidates pledged support for bus lanes, free buses, expanded Fair Fares, and shifting gas tax funds to mass transit. Lander vowed to end subway and street homelessness for the severely mentally ill by connecting them to stable housing. Mamdani promised a world-class bus network. Myrie pushed for citywide bus lanes. Ramos called for automatic Fair Fares registration. Stringer backed more bus routes. Walden opposed fare evasion crackdowns, urging resources go to service instead. All criticized Mayor Adams’ record on bus lanes and congestion pricing. The forum highlighted a united front for safer, more accessible transit, but offered no immediate relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law requires thirty. Riders wait. Buses crawl. Advocates rage. The city drags its feet. Streets stay dangerous. The promise of safer, faster transit goes unmet.</p><p class=mb3>""It s unacceptable that Mayor Adams has not prioritized improving bus speeds, service, and reliability with the tools he has at his control,"" -- Zellnor Myrie</p><p class=mb3>On August 5, 2024, the Department of Transportation revealed it has proposed only seven miles of bus priority lanes for the year—less than a quarter of the thirty miles required annually by the Streets Master Plan law. This marks the lowest bus lane mileage since 2018. The matter, titled 'Adams Has Proposed Just 7 Miles of Bus Lanes This Year — Less Than 1/4 of Requirement,' has drawn sharp criticism. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie called it 'unacceptable that Mayor Adams has not prioritized improving bus speeds, service, and reliability.' Scott Stringer accused the administration of using 'community engagement as an excuse to not get things done.' Brad Lander pledged to push for more dedicated bus lanes. Riders like Alex Gean described daily gridlock. The DOT claims more lanes are coming, but offers no details. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain at risk as the city fails to meet its own safety and mobility targets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
