The article, titled '‘Not a Bike-Friendly City:’ Cyclist Deaths Are Surging This Year in NYC,' details failures in bike infrastructure and city policy. Brooklyn Council Member Shahana Hanif accused Mayor Adams of 'undoing street safety' and called for 'political courage' to protect pedestrians and cyclists. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives demanded immediate, legally-required action under the NYC Streets Plan. Fourteen of the 20 deaths involved e-bikes. Ninety-three percent of fatalities happened on streets lacking protected lanes. Despite record ridership, the city missed its own goals for new bike lanes. Advocates and council members demand bold, urgent change.

The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023.

The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Senator Andrew Gounardes called the lawsuit a cynical move to control New York’s roads. MTA officials, including John McCarthy, defended the environmental review, citing extensive outreach and public hearings. The bill’s status is an official response to legal challenge, not a council vote or committee action. No direct safety impact assessment for vulnerable road users was provided.

Carroll said, "We think that this will go to the passengers who are disproportionately wealthier than the average New Yorker and significantly wealthier than the driver." The MTA has not considered this per-trip customer fee, and it is unclear if it can be implemented.

Disabled New Yorkers and the city’s air wait.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0638-2023 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It called on the New York State Legislature and Governor to create a surcharge for for-hire vehicles (FHVs), with funds aimed at expanding wheelchair-accessible and all-electric FHVs. The matter was introduced May 25, 2023, and filed at session’s end, never reaching enactment. The resolution’s title: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation that would create a surcharge for for-hire vehicles (FHVs) that would go towards funding the expansion of wheelchair accessible and all-electric FHVs.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, and Shahana K. Hanif sponsored the measure. The bill noted that only 4,858 of 95,129 FHVs were wheelchair accessible in 2022, and just 1% were all-electric. The measure aimed to close these gaps, but died in committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Black and Latino city workers now shoulder more of the cost. Lawmakers like Mamdani call it unfair. Suburban interests win. City’s vulnerable lose. Racial disparity grows.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, state lawmakers finalized a payroll tax policy as part of the MTA funding negotiations. The measure raised the payroll mobility tax only for New York City businesses with high payrolls, exempting suburban firms after pushback from their legislators. The Fiscal Policy Institute found this move shifted the tax burden onto Black and Latino workers in the city. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani condemned the policy, saying, 'this illustrates the consequences of fiscal policy that privileges the suburbs over the larger MTA region.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll was one of the few to oppose the exemption. FPI’s Emily Eisner noted, 'there will be a 25-percent decline in the share of white workers impacted by the tax, and a 36-percent increase in the share of Black workers impacted.' Governor Hochul defended the plan as necessary to save the MTA. The bill’s racial and geographic inequity remains stark.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Family and advocates say the plan skips key safety fixes. Jersey barriers leave gaps. Pedestrian islands and bike signals are missing. The city delays. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) latest redesign proposal for Ninth Street in Gowanus drew fire at a Community Board 6 meeting. The plan, discussed in the Transportation and Public Safety Committees, adds buffer-protected bike lanes and some jersey barriers, but skips driveways and omits pedestrian islands, raised intersections, and bicycle signals. Maxime Le Munier, whose wife Sarah Schick was killed by a truck driver on Ninth Street, said, “What we want is to guarantee everyone’s safety, and it seems like it’s going to fall short.” Community Board 6 Transportation Chair Doug Gordon and Public Safety Chair Jerry Armer echoed calls for stronger, faster action. Council Member Hanif hosted a recent event on the issue. The committees unanimously approved the DOT proposal with conditions: more pedestrian safety, more traffic calming, and a comprehensive plan for all of Ninth Street. DOT has not set a timeline. Schick’s family is suing the city for $100 million, alleging negligence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
