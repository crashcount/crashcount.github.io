Louis, Kalman Yeger, Sandy Nurse, Shahana K. Hanif, and Althea V. Stevens. The bill mandated a four-week comment window and a two-week response period, plus annual reporting and advance notice for temporary changes.

The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver.

The matter, titled 'Crossing the Street Should Not Be a Matter of Life and Death,' highlights the failure of current street design. Hanif, representing the district where Muschamp died, pledges to fight for safer streets. She calls for preventive design—daylighting, mid-block chicanes, leading pedestrian intervals, pedestrian-only crossings, and safety islands. Hanif opposes relying on punitive enforcement, saying, 'Planning streets for people means designs that force drivers to drive slowly and carefully.' She urges the Council and new administration to act, stating, 'Our streets are dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists because they are planned for cars, not people.' Hanif’s stance centers vulnerable road users and demands systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She wants action, not excuses.</p><p class=mb3>On January 18, 2022, Councilmember Shahana Hanif (District 39) issued a statement on pedestrian safety and street design. She declared, 'Crossing the street should not be a matter of life or death—but, for too many New Yorkers, it is.' Hanif invoked the death of Arcellie Muschamp, a nanny killed by a truck driver who failed to yield at Union Street and Fifth Avenue. Hanif criticized streets built for cars, not people, and called for preventive design: daylighting, chicanes, pedestrian intervals, Barnes Dances, and safety islands. She opposes relying on punitive enforcement. Hanif pledged to fight for safer streets so children and caretakers can cross without fear. Her statement underscores the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
