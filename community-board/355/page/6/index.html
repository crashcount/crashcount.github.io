But the blood did not stop. <strong>Thirty-five people were injured in 63 crashes</strong>. Six were hurt badly enough to be counted as serious injuries. The numbers are small. The pain is not. A cyclist thrown from her bike on Eastern Parkway. A pedestrian struck by a bike on Prospect Park West. A moped driver left bleeding on Flatbush Avenue. The wounds are real. The scars last.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Young adults and working-age people take the brunt.</strong> In the past twelve months, the 25–44 age group saw the most injuries. Children were not spared. Two under 18 were hurt. The old are not safe either. A person over 75 was injured. The street does not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Bikes, cars, and mopeds all draw blood.</strong> In the last three years, bikes caused three pedestrian injuries, mopeds one, and cars one. The city <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>counts the wounds</a>. It does not count the fear.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> It claims progress. It points to new speed limits and more cameras. But here, in CB55, the danger remains. No new bills, no bold redesigns, no public stands from local leaders. <strong>The silence is loud.</strong></p><h3 id=the-disaster-that-creeps>The Disaster That Creeps</h3><p>There is no single day of horror. The violence is slow. It comes in the form of a crash every few days. A broken arm. A bleeding head. A life changed. <strong>No one is safe until everyone is safe.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Ask for lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and real enforcement. Do not wait for the next crash. Do not wait for the next name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment. The debate exposes a city divided on how to protect its most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mandates linger in outer areas. Progress, but not full victory. Some districts carved out exceptions. Housing and parking no longer clash in core neighborhoods. Vulnerable road users still face cars in many places.</p><p class=mb3>""Council Member Shahana Hanif (D Kensington) was one of the progressives whose district includes some of the 'outer transit zone.' Her spokesperson said the Council member 'did not advocate for any carve outs.'"" -- Shahana K. Hanif</p><p class=mb3>On February 26, 2025, the City Council approved Mayor Adams's 'City of Yes' rezoning. The bill divided the city into zones: the Manhattan core, an inner transit zone with no parking mandates, an outer transit zone with reduced mandates, and areas beyond where mandates mostly remain. The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.' Council Member Sandy Nurse’s district saw mandates shaped by community board amendments, not her advocacy. Dan Garodnick, Department of City Planning chair, said, 'parking and housing are no longer coming into conflict in the parts of New York City that are well-served by transit.' The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others. No direct safety impact assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

We need leadership that's not afraid to stand up for us, or stand up against Donald Trump."" -- Zellnor Myrie</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration withdrew federal approval for New York City's congestion pricing program. U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy cited burdens on working-class drivers and questioned the legality of using toll revenue for transit. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit to challenge the move, arguing the program is settled law and already reduces congestion. State Senators Andrew Gounardes and Zellnor Myrie condemned the action, warning, 'Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system.' The withdrawal aligns with New Jersey's opposition and threatens transit upgrades like elevators for elderly and disabled riders.
