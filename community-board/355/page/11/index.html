They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No plan means more harm for people on foot, bike, or bus.</p><p class=mb3>On February 9, 2023, Governor Hochul’s administration confirmed the state has 'no plans' to redesign its portion of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, states the state DOT will only provide technical help to the city’s study of the 1.5-mile city-owned segment between Atlantic Avenue and Sands Street. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the state’s lack of engagement: 'The state hasn't engaged in any way shape or form.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said her community wants the BQE 'revisioned and totally changed,' citing environmental and health impacts. Assembly Member Robert Carroll warned that lack of coordination could worsen problems. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon echoed fears that her constituents would be left behind. The city, under Mayor Adams, has pledged a 'corridor-wide vision,' but admits nothing comprehensive can happen without state DOT. No safety analyst has assessed the impact, but the state’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, saw Simon and other officials racing at Smith-9th Streets station to dramatize the daily struggle of straphangers. The matter focused on 'the impact of low MTA funding and long wait times.' Simon said, 'It is really critically important...for people to be able to take reliable, safe, regular, speedy-enough transit service. That’s what’s going to get people out of their cars.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymembers Robert Carroll and Zohran Mamdani also participated, urging Albany to boost state funding and implement congestion pricing. The lawmakers oppose fare hikes and the rider-funded model, calling for public dollars to improve frequency and reliability. No formal bill was cited, but the advocacy targets the state budget and MTA funding structure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, led by Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Robert Carroll, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum, responded to Governor Hochul’s budget proposal. The matter: 'Advocates and legislators raced up the stairs...to press their case for Gov. Hochul to do more to fill the MTA's fiscal gap.' Hochul’s plan stabilizes finances but does not boost service or halt fare hikes. Mamdani and Gounardes called for six-minute off-peak trains and new taxes on the wealthy. Gounardes said, 'We all know that we need better service and we need more service.' The proposal remains under negotiation.

Its matter title reads: 'Requires the consideration of complete street design for certain transportation projects which receive federal or state funding.' Didi Barrett leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Amy Paulin, Carrie Woerner, and many others as co-sponsors. The bill compels agencies to consider complete street design—meaning streets built for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users, not just drivers. It also requires the department to publish guidance and reference materials for public use.

The Civilian Complaint Review Board had found Kovalik abused his authority, but Kleiman ruled, 'The evidence fails to support either of the specifications with which Respondent is charged.' NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell signed off on the decision. Senator Myrie, who testified about being shoved and threatened, condemned the ruling: 'This ruling is EXACTLY why New Yorkers have zero faith in the system.' Myrie and then-Assembly Member Diana Richardson, both detained at the protest, have filed a federal lawsuit.

Ninth Street stays deadly. DOT stops safety at Third Avenue. Advocates and Council Member Hanif demand action. City clings to parking. Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price. No new plans. Danger remains. Lives lost.</p><p class=mb3>Council Member Shahana Hanif and advocates are pressing the Department of Transportation to extend protected bike lanes and pedestrian safety measures on Brooklyn’s Ninth Street after a sixth fatality in 18 years. The DOT halted improvements at Third Avenue, citing commercial needs and parking. The matter, described as 'Councilmember(s) and advocates call for extension of protected bike lanes and pedestrian safety infrastructure on Ninth Street after fatal crash; DOT under scrutiny for inaction,' has not advanced to a formal bill or committee. Hanif met with DOT officials on January 12, 2023, expressing disappointment at the lack of immediate action. Maria Stylianou of Families for Safe Streets called the current half-measures unacceptable. Community members and activists, including Aaron Naparstek and Sarah Goodyear, condemned the city’s prioritization of parking over safety. DOT says it is reviewing the crash but has announced no concrete plans. The street remains hazardous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash happened where the protected bike lane ends and becomes sharrows, leaving riders unprotected. Council Member Shahana Hanif reported the death and said her office is working with NYPD and NYC DOT. Hanif promised to meet with DOT officials, stating, 'We should not have to live this way.' Transportation Alternatives blamed the street design, saying, 'At the location of this crash, the design of Ninth Street creates dangerous conditions for bike riders.' The area west of Third Avenue lacks protection due to DOT’s decision to preserve parking. From 2020 to 2022, eleven cyclists and six pedestrians were injured on this stretch. The crash exposes the deadly cost of prioritizing car volume and parking over safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They condemned the blanket ban, arguing it blocks access for delivery workers and families. Joseph and her colleagues oppose the current ban and the classification of e-bikes as motor vehicles.

The matter, titled 'Brooklyn pols call for repeal of Prospect Park e-bike ban,' highlights how the current policy keeps e-bikers out of the park, even after citywide legalization. The councilmembers wrote, 'E-bike users include delivery workers who keep us fed, families on cargo bikes, individuals recovering from surgery, older adults, people who live in areas with fewer public transit options, those who want to limit their carbon footprint by not driving cars, and so many more.' They argue the ban unfairly targets vulnerable riders and blocks access for those who rely on e-bikes for work and daily life. The Parks Department’s stance forces e-bike users onto more dangerous streets, undermining safety and equity. The councilmembers call for a new, inclusive policy shaped by community input.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
