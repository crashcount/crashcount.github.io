But the blood did not stop. <strong>Thirty-five people were injured in 63 crashes</strong>. Six were hurt badly enough to be counted as serious injuries. The numbers are small. The pain is not. A cyclist thrown from her bike on Eastern Parkway. A pedestrian struck by a bike on Prospect Park West. A moped driver left bleeding on Flatbush Avenue. The wounds are real. The scars last.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Young adults and working-age people take the brunt.</strong> In the past twelve months, the 25–44 age group saw the most injuries. Children were not spared. Two under 18 were hurt. The old are not safe either. A person over 75 was injured. The street does not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Bikes, cars, and mopeds all draw blood.</strong> In the last three years, bikes caused three pedestrian injuries, mopeds one, and cars one.

It does not count the fear.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> It claims progress. It points to new speed limits and more cameras. But here, in CB55, the danger remains. No new bills, no bold redesigns, no public stands from local leaders. <strong>The silence is loud.</strong></p><h3 id=the-disaster-that-creeps>The Disaster That Creeps</h3><p>There is no single day of horror. The violence is slow. It comes in the form of a crash every few days. A broken arm. A bleeding head. A life changed. <strong>No one is safe until everyone is safe.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Ask for lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and real enforcement. Do not wait for the next crash.

Lafleur was in the crosswalk with the walk signal when the driver of a 2025 Mercedes Benz GLC 300 struck her. A witness told Streetsblog, "The lady spin around and sped through," and described hearing the impact. The article notes that police have not released the driver's name. The incident occurred as NYPD focused enforcement on electric bikes, while drivers continue to cause deadly harm.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, Andrew Cuomo, running for NYC mayor, made a campaign statement targeting 'delivery chaos.' He proposes revising the city’s minimum pay law and making app companies liable for damages caused by delivery riders. His campaign website claims these changes will 'eliminate inappropriate incentives to dangerous use of e-bikes.' DoorDash donated $1 million to a Cuomo-aligned super PAC. Comptroller Brad Lander accused Cuomo of siding with app companies, saying, 'DoorDash is trying to buy Cuomo’s election...so he’ll roll back the law I passed that requires them to pay their workers a living wage.' Other officials, including Scott Stringer and Zellnor Myrie, voiced doubts about Cuomo’s commitment to delivery worker protections. The bill is not in committee; it is a campaign proposal. The safety impact for vulnerable road users remains unclear, but the fight over pay and regulation leaves delivery workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons.

The candidates—Brad Lander, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, Whitney Tilson, Zellnor Myrie, and Zohran Mamdani—support more dedicated bus lanes, stronger enforcement, and faster boarding. Scott Stringer calls for 'dedicated bus lanes, more enforcement, more shelters, better curbs, more transit signal priority, all-door boarding, and more frequent off-peak services.' Ramos blasts DOT for building only 23 of 150 mandated bus miles. Myrie pledges to exceed the city’s 30-mile annual target. Lander wants immediate all-door boarding and new busways. Mamdani promises rapid expansion and free buses. Each candidate frames bus reform as urgent, with vulnerable riders suffering most from delays and car dominance. The city’s next mayor will shape the streets—and the safety of those who use them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brad Lander, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, Whitney Tilson, Zellnor Myrie, and Zohran Mamdani answered. They called for more bus lanes, stronger enforcement, and faster service. No council bill was introduced; this was a public policy test, not legislation. According to the safety analyst, the event discussed bus speeds but did not specify any policy action affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so no direct safety impact can be assessed. The debate showed urgency but left vulnerable road users waiting for real change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s future hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2025, Streetsblog NYC launched a mayoral policy debate, pressing candidates on congestion pricing. The event was not a council bill, but a public challenge. Streetsblog asked: 'Now that congestion pricing is operating in New York City, what should the city government do to build on its success in reducing Manhattan traffic?' Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Whitney Tilson responded, each supporting congestion pricing and further transit investment. Streetsblog’s demand was clear—protect vulnerable road users. The safety analyst notes that congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and opens the door for street redesigns that put vulnerable users first. The debate underscores urgency: congestion pricing helps, but more must be done to make streets safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
