But the blood did not stop. <strong>Thirty-five people were injured in 63 crashes</strong>. Six were hurt badly enough to be counted as serious injuries. The numbers are small. The pain is not. A cyclist thrown from her bike on Eastern Parkway. A pedestrian struck by a bike on Prospect Park West. A moped driver left bleeding on Flatbush Avenue. The wounds are real. The scars last.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Young adults and working-age people take the brunt.</strong> In the past twelve months, the 25–44 age group saw the most injuries. Children were not spared. Two under 18 were hurt. The old are not safe either. A person over 75 was injured. The street does not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Bikes, cars, and mopeds all draw blood.</strong> In the last three years, bikes caused three pedestrian injuries, mopeds one, and cars one. The city <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>counts the wounds</a>. It does not count the fear.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> It claims progress. It points to new speed limits and more cameras. But here, in CB55, the danger remains. No new bills, no bold redesigns, no public stands from local leaders. <strong>The silence is loud.</strong></p><h3 id=the-disaster-that-creeps>The Disaster That Creeps</h3><p>There is no single day of horror. The violence is slow. It comes in the form of a crash every few days. A broken arm. A bleeding head. A life changed. <strong>No one is safe until everyone is safe.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Ask for lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and real enforcement. Do not wait for the next crash. Do not wait for the next name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event was not a formal bill or committee action, but a public statement on street safety. Myrie said, "We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible." He highlighted blocked bike lanes, rising injuries, and the lack of protected infrastructure. Myrie voiced support for congestion pricing, safer streets, and reducing car dependency. The safety impact is neutral: a senator riding a bike is symbolic and does not directly change safety outcomes for pedestrians or cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
