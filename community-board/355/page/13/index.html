But the blood did not stop. <strong>Thirty-five people were injured in 63 crashes</strong>. Six were hurt badly enough to be counted as serious injuries. The numbers are small. The pain is not. A cyclist thrown from her bike on Eastern Parkway. A pedestrian struck by a bike on Prospect Park West. A moped driver left bleeding on Flatbush Avenue. The wounds are real. The scars last.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Young adults and working-age people take the brunt.</strong> In the past twelve months, the 25–44 age group saw the most injuries. Children were not spared. Two under 18 were hurt. The old are not safe either. A person over 75 was injured. The street does not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Bikes, cars, and mopeds all draw blood.</strong> In the last three years, bikes caused three pedestrian injuries, mopeds one, and cars one. The city <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>counts the wounds</a>. It does not count the fear.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> It claims progress. It points to new speed limits and more cameras. But here, in CB55, the danger remains. No new bills, no bold redesigns, no public stands from local leaders. <strong>The silence is loud.</strong></p><h3 id=the-disaster-that-creeps>The Disaster That Creeps</h3><p>There is no single day of horror. The violence is slow. It comes in the form of a crash every few days. A broken arm. A bleeding head. A life changed. <strong>No one is safe until everyone is safe.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Ask for lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and real enforcement. Do not wait for the next crash. Do not wait for the next name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, described as 'NYC DOT proposal for car-free Grand Army Plaza and related street safety improvements,' is not a formal council bill but has drawn council attention. Council Member Shahana Hanif (District 39) and Crystal Hudson pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to address the plaza’s 'endless traffic, poor sidewalk conditions, broken benches, and overflowing trash cans.' Hanif and Hudson demanded immediate safety upgrades after recent crashes injured pedestrians and cyclists. DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton said, 'We want to take it to the next level... more consistent and better designed public spaces.' The agency is seeking public feedback and plans to draft detailed designs within the year. The proposal aims to end the status quo of danger and disrepair, prioritizing vulnerable road users over cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He supports only yellow cab drivers for additional exemptions, citing their medallion fees and capped numbers. Carroll insists Uber and Lyft drivers pay every time they enter the zone, regardless of fare. He also backs time-based charges for taxis, for-hire vehicles, and trucks, especially in busy corridors. Carroll acknowledges the financial burden but argues the cost of congestion is greater. He urges swift action, naming London, Milan, Stockholm, and Singapore as models.

The hearing followed a Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) investigation, which found Kovalik abused his authority by threatening Myrie and others with pepper spray during a protest on May 29, 2020. The matter centered on 'excessive use of force with department-issued bikes' and the officer's actions at a protest outside Barclays Center after George Floyd's murder. Myrie, detained with zip ties, said, 'I felt what felt like bike tires on my back and on my arms.' He described lasting trauma from the incident. The CCRB prosecutor, Andre Applewhite, argued video evidence confirmed the threats. Myrie and another lawmaker have filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD. The case highlights the dangers faced by peaceful protesters and the use of police bicycles as tools of force.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Amanda Farias, Gale Brewer, Shahana Hanif, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Christopher Marte, and Carlina Rivera joined as sponsors. Hanif stated, 'Our airspace is not for sale to the highest bidder and should only be available to essential needs of our city.' The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution.

Advocates like Kathy Park Price cite placard abuse and safety risks, calling for a permanent pedestrian space to expand the park and protect the community.

Zellnor Myrie sponsored a New York law enabling lawsuits against gun manufacturers for dangerous marketing or sales practices. The law, recently upheld in court, lets victims like Ilene Steur—injured in the Sunset Park subway shooting—sue Glock. The bill challenges federal PLCAA protections that shield gun companies. Myrie says, 'Bad actions by industries...are often forced to change their practices by way of litigation.' He insists, 'This isn’t about anyone coming after your legally possessed guns...The guns are killing my people.' The law is not about targeting legal gun owners, but about holding companies accountable when their products fuel violence. Gun industry groups are fighting the law, but for now, it stands.

Parents, workers, and people with disabilities faced threats and exclusion. Council Members Hanif, Joseph, and Hudson demand change. The ban blocks safe routes, targets the vulnerable, and deepens inequality.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, highlighted in a June 3, 2022 Streetsblog NYC opinion, centers on the Parks Department's ban on e-assist bikes in Prospect Park. Council Members Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Crystal Hudson, whose districts border or include the park, call for a new policy to allow e-assist bikes. The article states, 'This policy is discriminatory and ableist, and harmful to climate goals.' Hanif notes e-bikes enabled her to ride after hip surgery. The ban forces riders onto dangerous streets, blocks access for families and people with limited mobility, and invites selective NYPD enforcement. The council members urge Mayor Adams to lift the ban, arguing it closes the park to those who need safe, accessible routes most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
