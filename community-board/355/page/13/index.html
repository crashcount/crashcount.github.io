But the blood did not stop. <strong>Thirty-five people were injured in 63 crashes</strong>. Six were hurt badly enough to be counted as serious injuries. The numbers are small. The pain is not. A cyclist thrown from her bike on Eastern Parkway. A pedestrian struck by a bike on Prospect Park West. A moped driver left bleeding on Flatbush Avenue. The wounds are real. The scars last.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Young adults and working-age people take the brunt.</strong> In the past twelve months, the 25–44 age group saw the most injuries. Children were not spared. Two under 18 were hurt. The old are not safe either. A person over 75 was injured. The street does not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Bikes, cars, and mopeds all draw blood.</strong> In the last three years, bikes caused three pedestrian injuries, mopeds one, and cars one. The city <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>counts the wounds</a>. It does not count the fear.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> It claims progress. It points to new speed limits and more cameras. But here, in CB55, the danger remains. No new bills, no bold redesigns, no public stands from local leaders. <strong>The silence is loud.</strong></p><h3 id=the-disaster-that-creeps>The Disaster That Creeps</h3><p>There is no single day of horror. The violence is slow. It comes in the form of a crash every few days. A broken arm. A bleeding head. A life changed. <strong>No one is safe until everyone is safe.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Ask for lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and real enforcement. Do not wait for the next crash.

The DOT halted improvements at Third Avenue, citing commercial needs and parking.

Hanif met with DOT officials on January 12, 2023, expressing disappointment at the lack of immediate action. Maria Stylianou of Families for Safe Streets called the current half-measures unacceptable. Community members and activists, including Aaron Naparstek and Sarah Goodyear, condemned the city’s prioritization of parking over safety. DOT says it is reviewing the crash but has announced no concrete plans.

Transportation Alternatives blamed the street design, saying, 'At the location of this crash, the design of Ninth Street creates dangerous conditions for bike riders.' The area west of Third Avenue lacks protection due to DOT’s decision to preserve parking. From 2020 to 2022, eleven cyclists and six pedestrians were injured on this stretch.

Lives depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>On September 27, 2022, Assembly Member Robert Carroll made a public statement supporting congestion pricing in New York City. The matter, titled 'I’m Willing to Take the Heat to Support Congestion Pricing,' was reported by Streetsblog NYC. Carroll opposes broad exemptions, saying, 'Simplicity is key and exemptions should be limited.' He supports only yellow cab drivers for additional exemptions, citing their medallion fees and capped numbers. Carroll insists Uber and Lyft drivers pay every time they enter the zone, regardless of fare. He also backs time-based charges for taxis, for-hire vehicles, and trucks, especially in busy corridors. Carroll acknowledges the financial burden but argues the cost of congestion is greater. He urges swift action, naming London, Milan, Stockholm, and Singapore as models.

The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the Assembly as of August 30, 2022.

Salazar says, 'With the Ride Clean rebate, [e-bikes] really would be much more accessible to working New Yorkers.' Carroll pushes back on critics who call e-bikes a luxury, stating, 'They don’t realize that this is not a luxury item.' The program would use NYSERDA funds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, mirroring the Drive Clean program for electric cars. Advocates cite European and U.S. models.
