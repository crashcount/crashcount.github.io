But the blood did not stop. <strong>Thirty-five people were injured in 63 crashes</strong>. Six were hurt badly enough to be counted as serious injuries. The numbers are small. The pain is not. A cyclist thrown from her bike on Eastern Parkway. A pedestrian struck by a bike on Prospect Park West. A moped driver left bleeding on Flatbush Avenue. The wounds are real. The scars last.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Young adults and working-age people take the brunt.</strong> In the past twelve months, the 25–44 age group saw the most injuries. Children were not spared. Two under 18 were hurt. The old are not safe either. A person over 75 was injured. The street does not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Bikes, cars, and mopeds all draw blood.</strong> In the last three years, bikes caused three pedestrian injuries, mopeds one, and cars one.

No new bills, no bold redesigns, no public stands from local leaders. <strong>The silence is loud.</strong></p><h3 id=the-disaster-that-creeps>The Disaster That Creeps</h3><p>There is no single day of horror. The violence is slow. It comes in the form of a crash every few days. A broken arm. A bleeding head. A life changed. <strong>No one is safe until everyone is safe.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The money would fund city infrastructure. Trucks crowd streets. Packages pile up. The bill aims to slow the flood. City Hall will review. Delivery giants face new rules. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill on March 23, 2023, proposing a 25-cent surcharge on every online delivery package in New York City. The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The main loop’s eastern stretch will be repaved and repainted, giving cyclists a 16-to-18-foot shared lane with authorized vehicles, flanked by two pedestrian lanes up to 14 feet wide. The city rejected a two-bike-lane alternative, citing pedestrian access needs. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie praised the upgrade, calling Prospect Park a treasure. Chief Public Realm Officer Ya-Ting Liu said, 'Re-examining how we design the roads in our park system is a perfect example of how we’re advancing the Mayor’s vision for quality public spaces throughout the city.' Officials stress the park is closed to private vehicles.

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency outlined two options: diverting traffic onto local streets or constructing a bypass road. The matter, described as 'a controversial possibility reminiscent of an earlier plan,' sparked outrage. Assembly Member Robert Carroll slammed the idea of sending trucks onto residential blocks as 'insane.' Lara Birnback of the Brooklyn Heights Association called the plan disruptive and wasteful. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez highlighted public calls for 'safer bike and pedestrian connections' and new green space. No bill number or committee was cited. The plan remains a proposal, with no set price or location.

The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, states the state DOT will only provide technical help to the city’s study of the 1.5-mile city-owned segment between Atlantic Avenue and Sands Street. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the state’s lack of engagement: 'The state hasn't engaged in any way shape or form.'

Assembly Member Robert Carroll warned that lack of coordination could worsen problems. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon echoed fears that her constituents would be left behind.

The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, saw Simon and other officials racing at Smith-9th Streets station to dramatize the daily struggle of straphangers. The matter focused on 'the impact of low MTA funding and long wait times.' Simon said, 'It is really critically important...for people to be able to take reliable, safe, regular, speedy-enough transit service. That’s what’s going to get people out of their cars.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymembers Robert Carroll and Zohran Mamdani also participated, urging Albany to boost state funding and implement congestion pricing. The lawmakers oppose fare hikes and the rider-funded model, calling for public dollars to improve frequency and reliability. No formal bill was cited, but the advocacy targets the state budget and MTA funding structure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2023, legislators and advocates rallied for increased MTA funding and more frequent subway service. The event, led by Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Robert Carroll, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum, responded to Governor Hochul’s budget proposal. The matter: 'Advocates and legislators raced up the stairs...to press their case for Gov. Hochul to do more to fill the MTA's fiscal gap.' Hochul’s plan stabilizes finances but does not boost service or halt fare hikes. Mamdani and Gounardes called for six-minute off-peak trains and new taxes on the wealthy. Gounardes said, 'We all know that we need better service and we need more service.' The proposal remains under negotiation. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but frequent, reliable transit is vital for their safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case, reviewed internally by Assistant Trial Commissioner Josh Kleiman, ended with Kovalik cleared of wrongdoing. The Civilian Complaint Review Board had found Kovalik abused his authority, but Kleiman ruled, 'The evidence fails to support either of the specifications with which Respondent is charged.' NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell signed off on the decision. Senator Myrie, who testified about being shoved and threatened, condemned the ruling: 'This ruling is EXACTLY why New Yorkers have zero faith in the system.' Myrie and then-Assembly Member Diana Richardson, both detained at the protest, have filed a federal lawsuit.
