The matter, titled 'How Much Does DOT Spend to Keep Kids Safe Outside of Schools? The Agency Won’t Say,' exposes DOT’s refusal to disclose project costs or salaries tied to school safety. Councilmember Shahana Hanif joined Joseph in criticizing DOT’s lack of transparency. Both called for clear tracking of safety improvements around schools. DOT denied a Freedom of Information Law request, claiming no records exist and that costs are not broken out from its $1.3-billion budget. Advocates and families voiced outrage. The Department of Education also refused to discuss spending. The city’s silence leaves children exposed on dangerous streets, with no accountability for safety investments.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT halted improvements at Third Avenue, citing commercial needs and parking. The matter, described as 'Councilmember(s) and advocates call for extension of protected bike lanes and pedestrian safety infrastructure on Ninth Street after fatal crash; DOT under scrutiny for inaction,' has not advanced to a formal bill or committee. Hanif met with DOT officials on January 12, 2023, expressing disappointment at the lack of immediate action. Maria Stylianou of Families for Safe Streets called the current half-measures unacceptable. Community members and activists, including Aaron Naparstek and Sarah Goodyear, condemned the city’s prioritization of parking over safety. DOT says it is reviewing the crash but has announced no concrete plans.

Police charged White, ignored the driver’s violations, and called the driver a victim. Hanif demanded accountability for police misconduct.</p><p class=mb3>On November 16, 2022, Brooklyn Council Member Shahana Hanif issued a statement criticizing the NYPD’s 78th Precinct after officers arrested attorney Adam White. White, known for representing victims of traffic violence, was charged with criminal mischief for removing plastic that hid a car’s license plate—a tactic often used to dodge cameras and tolls. The NYPD did not ticket the driver, who had a record of violations, and instead labeled him the 'victim.' Hanif called the arrest 'outrageous' and 'police misconduct,' demanding accountability from precinct leadership. She said, 'It is shocking how the NYPD continues to prioritize unlawful and reckless car owners while harassing cyclists and pedestrians at every opportunity.' Legal experts, including White’s attorney Gideon Oliver, questioned the charges and called for dismissal. The case highlights systemic failures in traffic enforcement and police discretion, with vulnerable road users left exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort, not yet a formal bill, marks the start of a multiyear process with capital funding. The DOT presented plans to 'create more space for pedestrians and cyclists,' and floated ideas to connect Prospect Park’s northern entrance to the Soldiers Memorial Arch. Council Members Crystal Hudson and Shahana Hanif previously called for DOT to address 'signal timing and unprotected bike lanes.' Community advocates and residents voiced strong support for closing parts of the plaza to traffic and improving infrastructure for people walking and biking. The process includes public meetings, surveys, and a traffic study, with preliminary designs expected in 2024. While some residents worry about car access, the push is clear: less traffic, more safety for the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>On November 10, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation proposed making Grand Army Plaza car-free and connecting it to Open Streets on Vanderbilt and Underhill Avenues. The matter, described as 'NYC DOT proposal for car-free Grand Army Plaza and related street safety improvements,' is not a formal council bill but has drawn council attention. Council Member Shahana Hanif (District 39) and Crystal Hudson pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to address the plaza’s 'endless traffic, poor sidewalk conditions, broken benches, and overflowing trash cans.' Hanif and Hudson demanded immediate safety upgrades after recent crashes injured pedestrians and cyclists. DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton said, 'We want to take it to the next level... more consistent and better designed public spaces.' The agency is seeking public feedback and plans to draft detailed designs within the year. The proposal aims to end the status quo of danger and disrepair, prioritizing vulnerable road users over cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
