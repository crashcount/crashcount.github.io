But the blood did not stop. <strong>Thirty-five people were injured in 63 crashes</strong>. Six were hurt badly enough to be counted as serious injuries. The numbers are small. The pain is not. A cyclist thrown from her bike on Eastern Parkway. A pedestrian struck by a bike on Prospect Park West. A moped driver left bleeding on Flatbush Avenue. The wounds are real. The scars last.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Young adults and working-age people take the brunt.</strong> In the past twelve months, the 25–44 age group saw the most injuries. Children were not spared. Two under 18 were hurt. The old are not safe either. A person over 75 was injured. The street does not care how old you are.</p><p><strong>Bikes, cars, and mopeds all draw blood.</strong> In the last three years, bikes caused three pedestrian injuries, mopeds one, and cars one. The city <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>counts the wounds</a>. It does not count the fear.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> It claims progress. It points to new speed limits and more cameras. But here, in CB55, the danger remains. No new bills, no bold redesigns, no public stands from local leaders. <strong>The silence is loud.</strong></p><h3 id=the-disaster-that-creeps>The Disaster That Creeps</h3><p>There is no single day of horror. The violence is slow. It comes in the form of a crash every few days. A broken arm. A bleeding head. A life changed. <strong>No one is safe until everyone is safe.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Ask for lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and real enforcement. Do not wait for the next crash. Do not wait for the next name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Racial disparity grows.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, state lawmakers finalized a payroll tax policy as part of the MTA funding negotiations. The measure raised the payroll mobility tax only for New York City businesses with high payrolls, exempting suburban firms after pushback from their legislators. The Fiscal Policy Institute found this move shifted the tax burden onto Black and Latino workers in the city. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani condemned the policy, saying, 'this illustrates the consequences of fiscal policy that privileges the suburbs over the larger MTA region.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll was one of the few to oppose the exemption. FPI’s Emily Eisner noted, 'there will be a 25-percent decline in the share of white workers impacted by the tax, and a 36-percent increase in the share of Black workers impacted.' Governor Hochul defended the plan as necessary to save the MTA.

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) latest redesign proposal for Ninth Street in Gowanus drew fire at a Community Board 6 meeting. The plan, discussed in the Transportation and Public Safety Committees, adds buffer-protected bike lanes and some jersey barriers, but skips driveways and omits pedestrian islands, raised intersections, and bicycle signals. Maxime Le Munier, whose wife Sarah Schick was killed by a truck driver on Ninth Street, said, “What we want is to guarantee everyone’s safety, and it seems like it’s going to fall short.” Community Board 6 Transportation Chair Doug Gordon and Public Safety Chair Jerry Armer echoed calls for stronger, faster action. Council Member Hanif hosted a recent event on the issue. The committees unanimously approved the DOT proposal with conditions: more pedestrian safety, more traffic calming, and a comprehensive plan for all of Ninth Street. DOT has not set a timeline.

The proposal, discussed in the Assembly, faces suburban resistance. Carroll’s statement, titled "When It Comes to Transit, Everyone Must Pay Their Fair Share," argues that exempting suburbs would cost the MTA $325 million and undermine regional transit. Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the statement centers on funding the transit system that protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, presented ahead of a Brooklyn Community Board 6 meeting, follows the January death of Citi Bike rider Sarah Schick. The DOT's concept removes parking between Second and Third avenues to create a five-foot, buffer-protected bike lane in each direction. Council Member Shahana Hanif called the protected lane 'imperative' but said, 'getting this bike lane done is the first step towards a more serious look at this corridor.' Transportation Alternatives organizer Kathy Park Price said, 'We did the bare minimum... we can and should do more.' Schick’s widowed husband, Maxime Le Munier, blamed DOT inaction for her death. Advocates and Hanif urge a full corridor redesign, including one-way conversion, but DOT claims this is not feasible now. The plan is only a start.

The matter, described as a plan to 'save the MTA,' faces criticism for letting 'suburban fatcats' dodge responsibility. Assembly Member Robert Carroll (D-Brooklyn) slammed the exemption, asking, 'We have a regional network, why aren't we having the region pay for it?' Carroll called the carve-out 'unconscionable' and 'ridiculous,' pointing to billions spent on suburban transit. Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany warned the move 'sets a terrible precedent' and deepens inequity. MTA CEO Janno Lieber deferred to lawmakers but stressed the need to close the deficit.
