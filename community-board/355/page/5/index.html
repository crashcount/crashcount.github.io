The measure urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to require the MTA to provide free express bus fare for students commuting to and from school. The matter title states: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation that would require the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide free express bus fare to New York City students who take express buses to and from school.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers is the primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Justin L. Brannan, Shahana K. Hanif, Kamillah Hanks, and Tiffany Cabán. The bill highlights the steep $7 express bus fare, which leaves students in transit deserts with few safe, affordable options. The resolution remains in committee, pressing for equity and safer access for young New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment. The debate exposes a city divided on how to protect its most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Her spokesperson said the Council member 'did not advocate for any carve outs.'"" -- Shahana K.

The bill divided the city into zones: the Manhattan core, an inner transit zone with no parking mandates, an outer transit zone with reduced mandates, and areas beyond where mandates mostly remain. The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.' Council Member Sandy Nurse’s district saw mandates shaped by community board amendments, not her advocacy. Dan Garodnick, Department of City Planning chair, said, 'parking and housing are no longer coming into conflict in the parts of New York City that are well-served by transit.' The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others. No direct safety impact assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy cited burdens on working-class drivers and questioned the legality of using toll revenue for transit. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit to challenge the move, arguing the program is settled law and already reduces congestion. State Senators Andrew Gounardes and Zellnor Myrie condemned the action, warning, 'Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system.' The withdrawal aligns with New Jersey's opposition and threatens transit upgrades like elevators for elderly and disabled riders.

Sponsors push for public guidance. Streets built for people, not just cars. Safety for all hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A 324 was introduced on January 8, 2025, now in the sponsorship stage. The bill, titled 'Requires the consideration of complete street design for certain transportation projects which receive federal or state funding,' aims to force planners to consider all users—pedestrians, cyclists, drivers—when building or upgrading roads. Didi Barrett leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Amy Paulin, and many others. The bill also directs the department to publish street design guidance. No safety analyst note yet, but the measure’s intent is clear: streets should protect the most vulnerable, not just move traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, described as speeding, dragged Foster for half a mile before leaving him near Linden Blvd. and Nostrand Ave. The article quotes a witness: "I saw him at the stop light. He would go out to the cars and beg for change." The driver fled the scene and has not been caught. No arrests have been made. The incident highlights the lethal risk for pedestrians in city streets and the ongoing issue of hit-and-run drivers evading responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
