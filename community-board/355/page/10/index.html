Black and Latino city workers now shoulder more of the cost. Lawmakers like Mamdani call it unfair. Suburban interests win. City’s vulnerable lose. Racial disparity grows.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, state lawmakers finalized a payroll tax policy as part of the MTA funding negotiations. The measure raised the payroll mobility tax only for New York City businesses with high payrolls, exempting suburban firms after pushback from their legislators. The Fiscal Policy Institute found this move shifted the tax burden onto Black and Latino workers in the city. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani condemned the policy, saying, 'this illustrates the consequences of fiscal policy that privileges the suburbs over the larger MTA region.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll was one of the few to oppose the exemption. FPI’s Emily Eisner noted, 'there will be a 25-percent decline in the share of white workers impacted by the tax, and a 36-percent increase in the share of Black workers impacted.' Governor Hochul defended the plan as necessary to save the MTA. The bill’s racial and geographic inequity remains stark.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Family and advocates say the plan skips key safety fixes. Jersey barriers leave gaps. Pedestrian islands and bike signals are missing. The city delays. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) latest redesign proposal for Ninth Street in Gowanus drew fire at a Community Board 6 meeting. The plan, discussed in the Transportation and Public Safety Committees, adds buffer-protected bike lanes and some jersey barriers, but skips driveways and omits pedestrian islands, raised intersections, and bicycle signals. Maxime Le Munier, whose wife Sarah Schick was killed by a truck driver on Ninth Street, said, “What we want is to guarantee everyone’s safety, and it seems like it’s going to fall short.” Community Board 6 Transportation Chair Doug Gordon and Public Safety Chair Jerry Armer echoed calls for stronger, faster action. Council Member Hanif hosted a recent event on the issue. The committees unanimously approved the DOT proposal with conditions: more pedestrian safety, more traffic calming, and a comprehensive plan for all of Ninth Street. DOT has not set a timeline. Schick’s family is suing the city for $100 million, alleging negligence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed in the Assembly, faces suburban resistance. Carroll’s statement, titled "When It Comes to Transit, Everyone Must Pay Their Fair Share," argues that exempting suburbs would cost the MTA $325 million and undermine regional transit. Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the statement centers on funding the transit system that protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, presented ahead of a Brooklyn Community Board 6 meeting, follows the January death of Citi Bike rider Sarah Schick. The DOT's concept removes parking between Second and Third avenues to create a five-foot, buffer-protected bike lane in each direction. Council Member Shahana Hanif called the protected lane 'imperative' but said, 'getting this bike lane done is the first step towards a more serious look at this corridor.' Transportation Alternatives organizer Kathy Park Price said, 'We did the bare minimum... we can and should do more.' Schick’s widowed husband, Maxime Le Munier, blamed DOT inaction for her death. Advocates and Hanif urge a full corridor redesign, including one-way conversion, but DOT claims this is not feasible now. The plan is only a start.

The matter’s title reads: 'A Local Law in relation to requiring the department of transportation to study street design as a means to limit or reduce the use by commercial vehicles of streets in residential neighborhoods.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsored the bill, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate, and others. The report was due by December 31, 2023. The bill was filed at the end of session with no report issued. The measure aimed to examine street redesign, traffic calming, and camera enforcement to keep trucks out of residential areas, but it stalled before any impact reached the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution urged, in its own words, 'top maritime importers to New York City ports to commit to making the City’s streets greener by reducing truck traffic and using marine vessels for last mile deliveries throughout the boroughs.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsored, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate Williams, and others. The bill cited the city’s reliance on trucks—89% of freight—fueling congestion, pollution, and risk for everyone outside a vehicle. The Council pointed to pilot programs like Blue Highways as a way to clear streets and cut emissions. But the resolution was filed without action. Trucks still rule the road.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City studies a short stretch. Ten miles of highway cut through Brooklyn. Local leaders warn of neglect. Pollution and danger persist. No plan means more harm for people on foot, bike, or bus.</p><p class=mb3>On February 9, 2023, Governor Hochul’s administration confirmed the state has 'no plans' to redesign its portion of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, states the state DOT will only provide technical help to the city’s study of the 1.5-mile city-owned segment between Atlantic Avenue and Sands Street. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the state’s lack of engagement: 'The state hasn't engaged in any way shape or form.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said her community wants the BQE 'revisioned and totally changed,' citing environmental and health impacts. Assembly Member Robert Carroll warned that lack of coordination could worsen problems. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon echoed fears that her constituents would be left behind. The city, under Mayor Adams, has pledged a 'corridor-wide vision,' but admits nothing comprehensive can happen without state DOT. No safety analyst has assessed the impact, but the state’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
