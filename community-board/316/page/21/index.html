A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking.

The pedestrian was struck by a sedan that was backing unsafely. The impact caused a head injury, leaving the pedestrian semiconscious with minor bleeding. The driver, a licensed male from Massachusetts, was alone in the vehicle, which was parked before the crash. The report lists 'Backing Unsafely' as the contributing factor. No other driver errors or victim safety equipment were noted.

The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes.
