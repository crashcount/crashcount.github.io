A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking. It happened on July 3, but it could have been any night. &ldquo;A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>officials said</a>. The street did not forgive him. The car did not wait.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people have died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Seven more suffered serious injuries</strong>. <strong>548 were hurt</strong>. These are not numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are gone or broken. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=the-same-streets-the-same-silence>The Same Streets, The Same Silence</h3><p>The dead man is not alone. In Brooklyn CB16, the violence is steady. <strong>886 crashes</strong> in a year. The pain is spread by cars, trucks, bikes, buses. No one is spared. The city counts the bodies. The drivers keep moving.</p><p>Police say, &ldquo;The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The search goes on</a>. The families wait for news that does not come.</p><h3 id=leaders-votes-and-vows>Leaders: Votes and Vows</h3><p>Some leaders have moved. Council Member Darlene Mealy voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the walker, not the driver. She also co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>better lighting</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>towing abandoned cars</a>. State Senator Jabari Brisport backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/10/kathy-hochuls-bid-to-stop-congestion-pricing-might-be-illegal>congestion pricing</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bike lane enforcement</a>. But the streets do not change fast. The deaths do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, the people in charge. <strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand slower speeds, safer crossings, and real protection for people on foot and bike.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not remember.

Steel and stone replace painted lines.</p><p class=mb3>The Brooklyn Paper reported on June 11, 2025, that NYC DOT will redesign intersections to protect cyclists and pedestrians. The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. The move highlights the city's shift from painted lines to physical infrastructure, aiming to reduce systemic risk for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill requires drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red-light camera tickets in twelve months, to install intelligent speed assistance devices. Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes led the push, joined by co-sponsors Samra Brouk, Cordell Cleare, and others. The vote passed with support from senators including Jeremy Cooney, Pete Harckham, and Jessica Ramos. The measure aims to rein in repeat offenders and reduce deadly speeding. The bill’s language is blunt: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.'

The bill, titled "Relates to repealing congestion pricing (Part A); and commissioning an independent audit of the metropolitan transportation authority (Part B)," was sponsored by Jack M. Martins and co-sponsored by nine other senators. The bill sought to repeal congestion pricing and direct the MTA to conduct a forensic audit. The committee vote failed to pass the bill. Martins and his co-sponsors acted to end a program designed to cut car traffic and fund transit. No safety analyst note was provided, but repealing congestion pricing would have removed protections for pedestrians and cyclists who face daily danger from unchecked car volume.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
