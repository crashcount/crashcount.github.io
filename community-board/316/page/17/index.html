He never makes it across Sutter Avenue. Larry Maxwell, 72, is struck and left dying in the street. The driver flees. His son stands on the sidewalk, staring at the police tape, asking, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>“There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large?”</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, three people have died and 564 have been injured on the streets of Brooklyn CB16.</strong> Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry the scars.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-speed-disregard-and-flight>The Pattern: Speed, Disregard, and Flight</h2><p>A Mercedes runs a stop sign at Van Sinderen and Blake. The driver is unlicensed. He slams into a school bus, then leaves his passenger, Imani Vance, dying in the front seat. He calls a taxi and disappears. The District Attorney <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-driver-indicted-accused-of-deadly-hit-and-run-school-bus-crash>calls it</a> “a shocking disregard for human life and safety, made worse by his attempt to flee the scene instead of helping the victim.”</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks are the main weapons.</strong> In three years, they have caused 84 serious or moderate injuries to pedestrians. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the carnage is driven by speed and steel.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting</h2><p>The city has new powers. Sammy’s Law lets leaders lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders day and night. But in CB16, the blood keeps flowing. The law is passed, but the limit is not lowered. Cameras are threatened by legislative delay. The streets remain the same.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> The dead are not statistics. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors. The city says one death is too many. The numbers say three dead, 564 injured, and the year is not done.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. Do not let the silence win. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous.
