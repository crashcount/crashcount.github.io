He never makes it across Sutter Avenue. Larry Maxwell, 72, is struck and left dying in the street. The driver flees. His son stands on the sidewalk, staring at the police tape, asking, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>“There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large?”</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, three people have died and 564 have been injured on the streets of Brooklyn CB16.</strong> Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry the scars.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-speed-disregard-and-flight>The Pattern: Speed, Disregard, and Flight</h2><p>A Mercedes runs a stop sign at Van Sinderen and Blake. The driver is unlicensed. He slams into a school bus, then leaves his passenger, Imani Vance, dying in the front seat. He calls a taxi and disappears. The District Attorney <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-driver-indicted-accused-of-deadly-hit-and-run-school-bus-crash>calls it</a> “a shocking disregard for human life and safety, made worse by his attempt to flee the scene instead of helping the victim.”</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks are the main weapons.</strong> In three years, they have caused 84 serious or moderate injuries to pedestrians. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the carnage is driven by speed and steel.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting</h2><p>The city has new powers. Sammy’s Law lets leaders lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders day and night. But in CB16, the blood keeps flowing. The law is passed, but the limit is not lowered. Cameras are threatened by legislative delay. The streets remain the same.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> The dead are not statistics. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors. The city says one death is too many. The numbers say three dead, 564 injured, and the year is not done.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. Do not let the silence win. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
