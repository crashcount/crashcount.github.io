A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking. It happened on July 3, but it could have been any night. &ldquo;A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>officials said</a>. The street did not forgive him. The car did not wait.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people have died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Seven more suffered serious injuries</strong>. <strong>548 were hurt</strong>. These are not numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are gone or broken. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=the-same-streets-the-same-silence>The Same Streets, The Same Silence</h3><p>The dead man is not alone. In Brooklyn CB16, the violence is steady. <strong>886 crashes</strong> in a year. The pain is spread by cars, trucks, bikes, buses. No one is spared. The city counts the bodies. The drivers keep moving.</p><p>Police say, &ldquo;The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The search goes on</a>. The families wait for news that does not come.</p><h3 id=leaders-votes-and-vows>Leaders: Votes and Vows</h3><p>Some leaders have moved. Council Member Darlene Mealy voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the walker, not the driver. She also co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>better lighting</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>towing abandoned cars</a>. State Senator Jabari Brisport backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/10/kathy-hochuls-bid-to-stop-congestion-pricing-might-be-illegal>congestion pricing</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bike lane enforcement</a>. But the streets do not change fast. The deaths do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, the people in charge. <strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand slower speeds, safer crossings, and real protection for people on foot and bike.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not remember.
