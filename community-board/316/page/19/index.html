A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking. It happened on July 3, but it could have been any night. &ldquo;A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>officials said</a>. The street did not forgive him. The car did not wait.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people have died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Seven more suffered serious injuries</strong>. <strong>548 were hurt</strong>. These are not numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are gone or broken. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=the-same-streets-the-same-silence>The Same Streets, The Same Silence</h3><p>The dead man is not alone. In Brooklyn CB16, the violence is steady. <strong>886 crashes</strong> in a year. The pain is spread by cars, trucks, bikes, buses. No one is spared. The city counts the bodies. The drivers keep moving.</p><p>Police say, &ldquo;The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The search goes on</a>.

Council Member Darlene Mealy voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the walker, not the driver. She also co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>better lighting</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>towing abandoned cars</a>. State Senator Jabari Brisport backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/10/kathy-hochuls-bid-to-stop-congestion-pricing-might-be-illegal>congestion pricing</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bike lane enforcement</a>. But the streets do not change fast. The deaths do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, the people in charge. <strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand slower speeds, safer crossings, and real protection for people on foot and bike.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not remember.

The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
