He never makes it across Sutter Avenue. Larry Maxwell, 72, is struck and left dying in the street. The driver flees. His son stands on the sidewalk, staring at the police tape, asking, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>“There are so many cameras.

The injured carry the scars.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-speed-disregard-and-flight>The Pattern: Speed, Disregard, and Flight</h2><p>A Mercedes runs a stop sign at Van Sinderen and Blake. The driver is unlicensed. He slams into a school bus, then leaves his passenger, Imani Vance, dying in the front seat. He calls a taxi and disappears. The District Attorney <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-driver-indicted-accused-of-deadly-hit-and-run-school-bus-crash>calls it</a> “a shocking disregard for human life and safety, made worse by his attempt to flee the scene instead of helping the victim.”</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks are the main weapons.</strong> In three years, they have caused 84 serious or moderate injuries to pedestrians. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the carnage is driven by speed and steel.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting</h2><p>The city has new powers. Sammy’s Law lets leaders lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders day and night. But in CB16, the blood keeps flowing. The law is passed, but the limit is not lowered. Cameras are threatened by legislative delay. The streets remain the same.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> The dead are not statistics. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors. The city says one death is too many. The numbers say three dead, 564 injured, and the year is not done.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list.

The bill, sponsored by Senator Shelley Mayer (District 37), creates a speed camera program around schools in White Plains, set to expire December 31, 2030. The committee passed the bill, with only one senator, Mario Mattera, voting no. The measure aims to catch drivers who speed near schools, a proven danger to children and families on foot. Mayer’s bill targets reckless driving at the source.

An eight-year-old boy and his mother took the brunt. Broken arm. Head and neck wounds. The bus mounted the sidewalk, iron twisted, cinderblock shattered. The driver stayed. The street stayed dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on April 9, 2025, that a school bus crashed into a fence at Bedford Avenue and Farragut Road in Brooklyn, injuring an 8-year-old boy and his 43-year-old mother. The article quotes Councilmember Farrah Louis: "It appeared the driver was driving and hit the gas instead of the brakes, trying to avoid another car, and that's how he crashed." No students were on the bus at the time. The victims were hospitalized with serious injuries. Witnesses described the bus waiting for a pedestrian before suddenly jumping the curb and smashing through the fence. The incident highlights ongoing traffic dangers in the area and raises questions about driver error and the need for improved street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
