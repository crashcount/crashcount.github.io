He never makes it across Sutter Avenue. Larry Maxwell, 72, is struck and left dying in the street. The driver flees. His son stands on the sidewalk, staring at the police tape, asking, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>“There are so many cameras.

The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry the scars.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-speed-disregard-and-flight>The Pattern: Speed, Disregard, and Flight</h2><p>A Mercedes runs a stop sign at Van Sinderen and Blake. The driver is unlicensed. He slams into a school bus, then leaves his passenger, Imani Vance, dying in the front seat. He calls a taxi and disappears. The District Attorney <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-driver-indicted-accused-of-deadly-hit-and-run-school-bus-crash>calls it</a> “a shocking disregard for human life and safety, made worse by his attempt to flee the scene instead of helping the victim.”</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks are the main weapons.</strong> In three years, they have caused 84 serious or moderate injuries to pedestrians. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the carnage is driven by speed and steel.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting</h2><p>The city has new powers. Sammy’s Law lets leaders lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders day and night. But in CB16, the blood keeps flowing. The law is passed, but the limit is not lowered. Cameras are threatened by legislative delay. The streets remain the same.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> The dead are not statistics. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors. The city says one death is too many. The numbers say three dead, 564 injured, and the year is not done.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

A 40-year-old woman was crossing in the marked crosswalk when the truck struck her, crushing her hip and leg. The report states she was left conscious on the pavement, suffering from severe injuries. The vehicle's pre-crash action is listed as 'Backing,' and the point of impact was the 'Center Back End.' No contributing factors are cited for the pedestrian; the driver’s maneuver—reversing a large truck into a crosswalk—created the danger. The police report does not list any contributing pedestrian behaviors.
