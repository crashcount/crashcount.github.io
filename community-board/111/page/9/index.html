A car comes fast. He does not come home. In the last twelve months, five people died on the streets of Manhattan CB11. Nine more were left with injuries so grave they may never walk right again. The numbers do not flinch: 692 hurt, 1274 crashes—each one a life changed, a family waiting at the door.</p><p>A cyclist is thrown from his bike on East 135th. A woman is crushed crossing 1st Avenue. A newborn dies under the wheels of a Tesla on 3rd. The street does not care if you are young or old. It only takes.</p><h3 id=the-silence-of-power>The Silence of Power</h3><p>Local leaders have the tools. They have the laws. They have the power to slow the cars, to harden the crosswalks, to keep the lights burning. But the clock keeps ticking. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. The city has not done it. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half, but Albany lets the law hang by a thread. Each delay is another name on a slab.</p><p>On Randall’s Island, a mother rides her e-bike home from work. She is beaten and left for dead. Her daughter stands in the dark and <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>demands more protection, more lights, and calls it &ldquo;ridiculous that the park&mldr; had no lights and no cameras.&rdquo;</a> The city listens, but the darkness stays.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day the city waits, the body count grows. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras that never sleep. Demand streets where a child can cross and live.</p><p>Do not wait for another name. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
