They do not care about hope or promises. They only count the bodies.</p><p>Just this year, two people were killed on the streets. Five hundred forty-one were hurt.

He died in the dark hours of January. A 66-year-old man was killed on 5th Avenue near 135th Street. A 35-year-old woman, a passenger on a motorcycle, died on East 106th.
