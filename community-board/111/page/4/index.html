Eight hundred seventy-nine injured. Ten left with wounds that will never heal.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Manhattan CB11 in the last twelve months. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or promises. They only count the bodies.</p><p>Just this year, two people were killed on the streets. Five hundred forty-one were hurt. Serious injuries doubled compared to last year. The disaster does not come all at once. It comes in the slow grind of crashes—<strong>1,015 so far this year, up 46% from last year</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=the-names-behind-the-numbers>The Names Behind the Numbers</h2><p>A man, 53, was crushed by an SUV on Harlem River Drive. He died in the dark hours of January. A 66-year-old man was killed on 5th Avenue near 135th Street. A 35-year-old woman, a passenger on a motorcycle, died on East 106th. The road does not care about age or reason. It only takes.</p><h2 id=the-voices-of-the-street>The Voices of the Street</h2><p>Residents see the danger.

She has voted for pavement markings and transparency bills. But the carnage continues. <strong>Most deaths happen on streets without real protection.</strong></p><p>Senator Jose Serrano <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit.

Chaos thrives where speed meets congestion.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit (2025-07-06) reports a crash on Central Park’s West Drive, near West 60th Street. An illegal electric unicycle hit a cyclist, sending its operator to the hospital in critical but stable condition. The cyclist, Carolyn Backus, was wrongly charged with leaving the scene, though she "remained on scene for about 45 minutes after the crash and waited for paramedics." The Manhattan D.A. dismissed the charge, noting Backus rode a non-motorized bike. The article highlights the risk of high-speed e-vehicles in crowded park zones, where "unpredictable congestion makes it the last place...anyone should be speeding."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
