They do not care about hope or promises. They only count the bodies.</p><p>Just this year, two people were killed on the streets. Five hundred forty-one were hurt.

The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users.
