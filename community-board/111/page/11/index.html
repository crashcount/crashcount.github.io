Twenty-seven suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 680 were hurt, six killed. The dead do not speak. The living limp, bleed, or grieve. A man steps off the curb and does not come home. A cyclist is thrown to the pavement, head split open. A mother is beaten for her e-bike, left with a broken skull and a family waiting in the dark.</p><p>On May 16, Diana Agudela was attacked on Randall’s Island. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>demanded more protection and lights</a>: &ldquo;We need more protection, we need more lights. It is ridiculous that the park that my mom would ride from to go from work to home had no lights and no cameras.&rdquo; The path was dark. The city was silent.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> Six deaths, 243 minor injuries, 94 moderate, three serious. Trucks and buses: two dead, 17 minor, 13 moderate, one serious. Motorcycles and mopeds: one dead, 14 minor, two moderate, one serious. Bikes: one dead, 20 minor, 15 moderate, two serious. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies. They are lives cut short or broken.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p>City Hall talks about Vision Zero. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, letting the city lower speed limits. But the limit is not yet lowered. The city could act now. It waits. <strong>Speed cameras save lives, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire.</strong></p><p>After a crash in Central Park, a daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>described her mother as defenseless</a>: &ldquo;She was a defenseless person who was leaving tired from work, coming back to her kids.&rdquo; The city has not defended her. The council and mayor have the power. They have not used it.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not fate.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand lights and cameras where the city leaves you in the shadows. Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
