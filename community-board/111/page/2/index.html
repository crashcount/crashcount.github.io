Twenty-seven suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 680 were hurt, six killed. The dead do not speak. The living limp, bleed, or grieve. A man steps off the curb and does not come home. A cyclist is thrown to the pavement, head split open. A mother is beaten for her e-bike, left with a broken skull and a family waiting in the dark.</p><p>On May 16, Diana Agudela was attacked on Randall’s Island. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>demanded more protection and lights</a>: &ldquo;We need more protection, we need more lights. It is ridiculous that the park that my mom would ride from to go from work to home had no lights and no cameras.&rdquo; The path was dark. The city was silent.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> Six deaths, 243 minor injuries, 94 moderate, three serious. Trucks and buses: two dead, 17 minor, 13 moderate, one serious. Motorcycles and mopeds: one dead, 14 minor, two moderate, one serious. Bikes: one dead, 20 minor, 15 moderate, two serious.

They are lives cut short or broken.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p>City Hall talks about Vision Zero. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, letting the city lower speed limits. But the limit is not yet lowered. The city could act now. It waits. <strong>Speed cameras save lives, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire.</strong></p><p>After a crash in Central Park, a daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>described her mother as defenseless</a>: &ldquo;She was a defenseless person who was leaving tired from work, coming back to her kids.&rdquo; The city has not defended her.

Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand lights and cameras where the city leaves you in the shadows. Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The demonstration, which began at Union Square, challenged new policies issuing criminal summonses for minor cycling offenses. Riders followed traffic laws, highlighting the crackdown’s contradictions. One cyclist, Erin Poland, said the policy 'is not actually protecting cyclists [but] putting them in more danger.' Another, Tara Pham, noted, 'I’ve been hit by vehicles twice... those drivers face no criminal charges.' The article details how police arrested a Citi Bike rider for not moving aside and lacking ID, while drivers who injure vulnerable road users often avoid serious consequences.

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers.

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
