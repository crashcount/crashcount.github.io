Twenty-eight more are seriously hurt.</strong> In just the last twelve months, Manhattan CB11 saw 1,411 crashes. Six people died. Seven hundred forty-three were injured. The numbers are blunt, but the pain is sharp. A man steps into the street. A car crushes his body. The city moves on. His family does not.</p><p><strong>Just last summer, a 51-year-old man was killed on East 105th Street.</strong> Another man, 60, was left bruised and broken beside him. The crash involved a motorcycle, a truck, two sedans, and an SUV. Five vehicles. Two men on foot.

Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every crosswalk. Demand real enforcement against the drivers who kill and maim. The dead cannot speak.

Yu ordered, 'Get out of the car and show some ID,' and later, 'Get in the car! You're not going anywhere!' The woman was placed in the back seat of Yu’s vehicle. The arrest was later voided. The Attorney General’s office stated, 'OAG is investigating this matter internally and will not have further comment at this time.'

Prosecutors say Michael Aracena, 20, received a gun from an accomplice and shot Campbell as he sat behind the wheel. Aracena abandoned his car in Pennsylvania and was arrested at the airport before boarding a flight to the Dominican Republic. The article states, 'An accomplice handed Aracena the gun used to shoot Campbell in the chest as the victim sat behind the wheel.' Police are still searching for the accomplice.
