Twenty-seven suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 680 were hurt, six killed. The dead do not speak. The living limp, bleed, or grieve. A man steps off the curb and does not come home. A cyclist is thrown to the pavement, head split open. A mother is beaten for her e-bike, left with a broken skull and a family waiting in the dark.</p><p>On May 16, Diana Agudela was attacked on Randall’s Island. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>demanded more protection and lights</a>: &ldquo;We need more protection, we need more lights. It is ridiculous that the park that my mom would ride from to go from work to home had no lights and no cameras.&rdquo; The path was dark. The city was silent.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> Six deaths, 243 minor injuries, 94 moderate, three serious. Trucks and buses: two dead, 17 minor, 13 moderate, one serious. Motorcycles and mopeds: one dead, 14 minor, two moderate, one serious. Bikes: one dead, 20 minor, 15 moderate, two serious. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies. They are lives cut short or broken.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p>City Hall talks about Vision Zero. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, letting the city lower speed limits. But the limit is not yet lowered. The city could act now. It waits. <strong>Speed cameras save lives, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire.</strong></p><p>After a crash in Central Park, a daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>described her mother as defenseless</a>: &ldquo;She was a defenseless person who was leaving tired from work, coming back to her kids.&rdquo; The city has not defended her. The council and mayor have the power. They have not used it.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not fate.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand lights and cameras where the city leaves you in the shadows. Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Eyewitness Hayley said, "I was there with my friend walking on the sidewalk and almost got trampled by the poor horse. It was so terrifying." Parkgoers scrambled for safety, some jumping fences. Cyclists chased the horse, warning others. The horse was not tethered to a hitching post, as none was nearby. Christina Hansen, union rep for carriage horses, stated, "There were no injuries or property damage reported, and there's currently no indication the horse's driver was negligent." The incident highlights gaps in securing procedures and the absence of hitching posts, raising questions about safety for pedestrians and park users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.'

The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays.

Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model.
