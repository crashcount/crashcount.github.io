Eight hundred seventy-nine injured. Ten left with wounds that will never heal.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Manhattan CB11 in the last twelve months. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or promises. They only count the bodies.</p><p>Just this year, two people were killed on the streets. Five hundred forty-one were hurt. Serious injuries doubled compared to last year. The disaster does not come all at once. It comes in the slow grind of crashes—<strong>1,015 so far this year, up 46% from last year</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=the-names-behind-the-numbers>The Names Behind the Numbers</h2><p>A man, 53, was crushed by an SUV on Harlem River Drive. He died in the dark hours of January. A 66-year-old man was killed on 5th Avenue near 135th Street. A 35-year-old woman, a passenger on a motorcycle, died on East 106th.

She has voted for pavement markings and transparency bills. But the carnage continues. <strong>Most deaths happen on streets without real protection.</strong></p><p>Senator Jose Serrano <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit.
