Seddio claims the lane will only shift location and disputes the safety benefits, arguing, 'The bike lane will still exist, but merely shift to an alternative location in the road.' He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%. The case highlights ongoing tension between local political power, city notification procedures, and efforts to protect cyclists and pedestrians through street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use. Safety analysts note congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and supports safer, more equitable streets. The program’s future now rests with the federal courts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Plaintiffs argue the city violated Administrative Code Section 19-101.2, which requires advance notice and community input before removing bike lanes. The Department of Transportation skipped this step, announcing the removal on social media after consulting only select community members. The article quotes the lawsuit: the city acted "improperly, irrationally, without proper legal notice and in an abuse of discretion." Data cited in the suit show the upgraded lane improved safety for all road users. Councilman Lincoln Restler supported the legal action, seeking a restraining order to keep the lane. The case highlights failures in city process and the risks posed when safe infrastructure is abruptly erased.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact sent the SUV into a southbound NYPD cruiser. The article notes, 'An SUV slammed into an NYPD cruiser in a three-car smash-up in Brooklyn early Sunday.' Two police officers and two SUV passengers were hospitalized in stable condition. One person was taken into custody, though no charges were filed at the time of reporting. The crash, which occurred at 2:11 am, highlights the dangers at busy intersections and the violent force unleashed when vehicles collide.

The lane calmed a deadly stretch. Drivers still parked illegally. Children darted into traffic. Now, cyclists and pedestrians face more danger. Policy shifts, safety slips. Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
