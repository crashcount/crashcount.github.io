Neither occupant was ejected from their vehicles. Vehicle damage included impact to the right rear quarter panel of the male driver’s sedan and front-end damage to the female driver’s vehicle.

The collision occurred at 7:35 p.m. and left the boy with crush injuries to his legs. The report states, 'A 14-year-old boy on an e-scooter, no helmet, struck by a speeding sedan. The car’s right bumper crushed his legs. He stayed awake. Blood pooled on the street where his ride ended.' The police report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor in the crash. The sedan’s right front bumper was the point of impact, matching the boy’s lower leg injuries. The report notes the boy was not wearing a helmet, but this is listed after the driver’s error of unsafe speed. The focus remains on the driver’s excessive speed, which led directly to the severe injuries suffered by the vulnerable e-scooter rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The official matter focused on 'excessive illegal parking—including by the local police precinct.' CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers.
