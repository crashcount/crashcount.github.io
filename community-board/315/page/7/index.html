Officers first noticed the vehicle due to stolen plates and tried to pull it over on Cropsey Avenue. The driver fled, leading police to set up a blockade. As the car tried to pass, an officer fired one round, striking the driver. The wounded man crashed into a police car and was later pronounced dead at Brookdale Hospital.

The matter summary states: 'ban noisy non-essential helicopter flights from city heliports following a recent fatal crash.' Majority Leader Amanda Farias, the sponsor, said, 'Intro 26 is a bold step toward a healthier, quieter, and more equitable city.' Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, District 48, voted against the bill.

The bill is supported by Amber Adler of Families for Safe Streets and Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, who call out the deadly pattern of repeat offenders. Furnas says, 'These results point to a small population with a shocking pattern of recidivism, resistance to traditional deterrents, and disregard for human life.' Adler points to a recent fatal crash by a repeat offender as proof of legislative failure. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposes the bill, claiming six tickets is not excessive. The NYPD withholds license plate data, blocking public scrutiny. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has expired, leaving no replacement.

The local community board and Vernikov demanded a one-to-one parking ratio. Rachel Fee, an advocate, called it 'inexcusable' to have more parking than homes in a transit-rich city.

The February crash killed his passenger, Imani Vance, 26, and injured the bus driver. According to the Brooklyn DA, Epps then left the scene, calling an Uber and fleeing before being apprehended. The article quotes DA Eric Gonzalez: 'The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant's reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds.' The crash pushed the bus into a third, unoccupied vehicle. No children on the bus were harmed.
