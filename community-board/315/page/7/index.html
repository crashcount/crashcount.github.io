The measure, heard in committee and passed 46-1-1, bans non-essential helicopters that fail FAA noise standards from East 34th Street and Wall Street heliports starting in late 2029. The matter summary states: 'ban noisy non-essential helicopter flights from city heliports following a recent fatal crash.' Majority Leader Amanda Farias, the sponsor, said, 'Intro 26 is a bold step toward a healthier, quieter, and more equitable city.' Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, District 48, voted against the bill. The legislation now awaits Mayor Eric Adams’ signature.

Furnas says, 'These results point to a small population with a shocking pattern of recidivism, resistance to traditional deterrents, and disregard for human life.' Adler points to a recent fatal crash by a repeat offender as proof of legislative failure. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposes the bill, claiming six tickets is not excessive.

The local community board and Vernikov demanded a one-to-one parking ratio. Rachel Fee, an advocate, called it 'inexcusable' to have more parking than homes in a transit-rich city.
