The measure, heard in committee and passed 46-1-1, bans non-essential helicopters that fail FAA noise standards from East 34th Street and Wall Street heliports starting in late 2029. The matter summary states: 'ban noisy non-essential helicopter flights from city heliports following a recent fatal crash.' Majority Leader Amanda Farias, the sponsor, said, 'Intro 26 is a bold step toward a healthier, quieter, and more equitable city.' Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, District 48, voted against the bill. The legislation now awaits Mayor Eric Adams’ signature. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the bill responds to helicopter crashes that threaten New Yorkers on the ground.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One driver collected 563 speed-camera tickets in Sheepshead Bay; another, 474 in Manhattan. The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low.

It would require speed limiter technology for drivers with six or more automated enforcement tickets in a year. The bill is supported by Amber Adler of Families for Safe Streets and Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, who call out the deadly pattern of repeat offenders. Furnas says, 'These results point to a small population with a shocking pattern of recidivism, resistance to traditional deterrents, and disregard for human life.' Adler points to a recent fatal crash by a repeat offender as proof of legislative failure. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposes the bill, claiming six tickets is not excessive. The NYPD withholds license plate data, blocking public scrutiny. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has expired, leaving no replacement. Advocates say the bill is urgent to stop the next tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Tragedy Underscores Shortcomings of Vision Zero Era State Ocean Parkway Fixes,' highlights the failure of current efforts. Despite millions spent on speed cameras and signals, the six-lane highway remains deadly. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov called for higher speed limits. State Senator Simcha Felder pushed for a 30 mph limit, above the citywide standard. Advocates like Jon Orcutt demand deeper redesigns—lane reductions, pedestrian islands. Residents and experts say enforcement alone cannot save lives. Local opposition and political power block bold changes. The city DOT promises more work, but the danger persists. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers promise change.</p><p class=mb3>On April 1, 2025, Council Member Shahana Hanif joined a rally at Brooklyn Borough Hall demanding passage of the Stop Super Speeders bill. The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws. Some opposition remains, but supporters say the measure is urgent and practical.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
