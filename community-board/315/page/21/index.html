They claim the toll shifts pollution, burdens drivers, and fails communities with poor transit. The MTA defends the plan, saying it funds safer, less crowded streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 4, 2024, Council Member Joseph C. Borelli (District 51) joined seventeen other lawmakers in a federal lawsuit to block New York City’s $15 congestion pricing toll for Midtown Manhattan. The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation. The case highlights the political and environmental battle over how to fund and shape New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.
