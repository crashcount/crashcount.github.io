The bill aimed to require every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter, and other legal motorized vehicle to be registered with the Department of Transportation and display a visible license plate. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.' Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections. The streets stayed dangerous. The cars kept their edge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets near schools remain deadly, especially for children of color.</p><p class=mb3>On September 15, 2022, a hit-and-run driver injured a 10-year-old boy at W. 20th Street and Mermaid Avenue in Coney Island. The boy, walking home from school with his grandmother, was struck as the driver sped through a red light and fled the scene. Witnesses described chaos and pain. Streetsblog reports, 'streets near schools are more dangerous on average than other city streets.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, whose district includes the area, was recently caught speeding in school zones 23 times. Data shows a 57% higher crash rate and 25% more injuries per mile near schools during peak hours. The danger is worse outside schools serving mostly students of color. The 60th Precinct, where the crash occurred, has seen 711 crashes this year, injuring 57 pedestrians and 26 cyclists. Systemic neglect and reckless driving keep children at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She voted against the Council’s home rule message to expand New York’s speed camera program, which would allow 24/7 automated enforcement. Vernikov called speed cameras a scheme to 'take away more of our hard-earned money.' The bill, debated in September 2022, was opposed by Vernikov and others, despite rising traffic deaths. Her car also received 31 non-moving violations, including parking at fire hydrants and in bus lanes. Democratic challenger Amber Adler and StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure condemned Vernikov’s driving and her vote, saying she endangers constituents. Vernikov has advocated for armed guards and mental health reforms in schools, but opposes proven traffic safety measures. No safety analyst assessment was provided for this action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
