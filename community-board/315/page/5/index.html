Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, four people died and nine more were maimed. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A mother and her daughters, crossing with the light, were crushed at Ocean Parkway and Quentin Road. The numbers do not bleed, but the street does.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapon.</strong> In this district, they killed seven and left 118 with moderate or serious wounds. Trucks and buses took three more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are in the count, but the steel giants do most of the damage. The old, the young, the ones on foot—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h2><p>The stories repeat. A sedan strikes a pedestrian mid-block on Coney Island Avenue. An SUV slams into a police cruiser at Avenue U, sending two officers and two others to the hospital. &ldquo;A drunken driver crashed into an SUV in Brooklyn early Sunday, sparking a chain-reaction crash that left his passenger and two NYPD cops hurt,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/15/brooklyn-drunk-driver-hurts-2-passengers-2-nypd-cops-in-chain-reaction-crash/>wrote the NY Daily News</a>.

Speed cameras, lower limits, intersection redesigns. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. <strong>Local leaders have the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have the power to harden crosswalks and protect the most vulnerable.</strong> Each day they wait, the toll grows.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just words.</strong> The violence will not stop until you force them to act. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash left a new life cut short, a city shaken.</p><p class=mb3>According to the NY Daily News (published March 1, 2025), Christopher Seabrook, 28, was arrested for the hit-and-run crash that killed Hayden Wallace, 29, in Bushwick on January 8, 2024. Seabrook allegedly crashed a Kia Sportage into a Toyota Yaris carrying Wallace and friends, then fled the scene on foot. Wallace died; two others were critically injured. The Toyota’s driver was also charged with driving without a license. Seabrook faces charges including manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and leaving the scene. The article quotes Wallace’s aunt: “He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered.” The case highlights the deadly consequences of reckless driving and fleeing crash scenes in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

More parking means more cars, more danger for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>On February 18, 2025, Brooklyn Community Board 15 rejected a rezoning proposal at 2510 Coney Island Ave. The board’s vote came after the developer slashed housing units and promised a one-to-one parking ratio. The official matter focused on 'excessive illegal parking—including by the local police precinct.' CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers. The City Council is expected to reject the project, blocking new homes and locking in car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, now in committee, targets riders not already covered by helmet laws. The city’s car carnage continues. Lawmakers focus on headgear, not street danger.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1173-2025 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after introduction on January 23, 2025. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of New York, in relation to requiring bicyclists to wear protective headgear,' would require every cyclist not already mandated by other laws to wear a helmet. Violators face civil penalties up to $50. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Council Members Holden, Vernikov, Narcisse, Moya, Schulman, Louis, Hanks, Brannan, and Zhuang. The bill does not address the root causes of cyclist injuries: reckless drivers, speeding cars, and deadly streets. Instead, it shifts responsibility onto those most at risk, leaving the city’s dangerous roads unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
