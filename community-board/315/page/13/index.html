Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, four people died and nine more were maimed. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A mother and her daughters, crossing with the light, were crushed at Ocean Parkway and Quentin Road. The numbers do not bleed, but the street does.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapon.</strong> In this district, they killed seven and left 118 with moderate or serious wounds. Trucks and buses took three more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are in the count, but the steel giants do most of the damage. The old, the young, the ones on foot—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h2><p>The stories repeat. A sedan strikes a pedestrian mid-block on Coney Island Avenue. An SUV slams into a police cruiser at Avenue U, sending two officers and two others to the hospital. &ldquo;A drunken driver crashed into an SUV in Brooklyn early Sunday, sparking a chain-reaction crash that left his passenger and two NYPD cops hurt,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/15/brooklyn-drunk-driver-hurts-2-passengers-2-nypd-cops-in-chain-reaction-crash/>wrote the NY Daily News</a>.

Speed cameras, lower limits, intersection redesigns. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. <strong>Local leaders have the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have the power to harden crosswalks and protect the most vulnerable.</strong> Each day they wait, the toll grows.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just words.</strong> The violence will not stop until you force them to act. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
