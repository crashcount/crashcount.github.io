In Brooklyn CB15, the numbers do not lie. Since January 2022, there have been <strong>16 deaths</strong> and <strong>2,543 injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>Children, elders, mothers.</strong> The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just days ago, a 90-year-old man was struck and killed by a moped at Avenue U and East 14th Street. The rider stopped, looked, and left him dying in the crosswalk. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said a witness</a>. The driver wore a mask. The police are still searching.</p><p>On Ocean Parkway this spring, a mother and her two daughters were killed crossing with the light. The driver had a record of speed camera violations. The city counted the bodies. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-silence>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Silence</h3><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, these vehicles killed seven people and injured nearly 500 more. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds, often unregistered, injured and killed with impunity. Bikes caused no deaths, just a handful of minor injuries.</p><p>The numbers are not fate. They are the result of choices. <strong>Speed, size, and inaction kill.</strong></p><h3 id=leaders-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Leaders: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Inna Vernikov co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bills for speed humps and rewards for hit-and-run tips</a>. But she also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against ending jaywalking enforcement</a>—a law that would have protected people on foot. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>fought to pause new bike lanes</a>, calling them a &ldquo;woke agenda&rdquo; while the crashes kept coming. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>opposed speed cameras and lower limits</a>, saying the speed is &ldquo;too slow&rdquo; on Ocean Parkway. He called for higher speeds, even as families buried their dead.</p><p>A neighbor spoke for many: &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said Ryan Rivera</a>.</p><h3 id=what-now-the-only-way-out-is-through>What Now: The Only Way Out Is Through</h3><p><strong>This is not an accident. It is a policy failure.</strong> Every day of delay means another family waits for a call that never should come. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand action, not excuses.</strong></p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not washed away by words. Only by change.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
