In Brooklyn CB15, the numbers do not lie. Since January 2022, there have been <strong>16 deaths</strong> and <strong>2,543 injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>Children, elders, mothers.</strong> The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just days ago, a 90-year-old man was struck and killed by a moped at Avenue U and East 14th Street. The rider stopped, looked, and left him dying in the crosswalk. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said a witness</a>. The driver wore a mask. The police are still searching.</p><p>On Ocean Parkway this spring, a mother and her two daughters were killed crossing with the light. The driver had a record of speed camera violations. The city counted the bodies. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-silence>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Silence</h3><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, these vehicles killed seven people and injured nearly 500 more. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds, often unregistered, injured and killed with impunity. Bikes caused no deaths, just a handful of minor injuries.</p><p>The numbers are not fate. They are the result of choices. <strong>Speed, size, and inaction kill.</strong></p><h3 id=leaders-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Leaders: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Inna Vernikov co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bills for speed humps and rewards for hit-and-run tips</a>. But she also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against ending jaywalking enforcement</a>—a law that would have protected people on foot. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>fought to pause new bike lanes</a>, calling them a &ldquo;woke agenda&rdquo; while the crashes kept coming. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>opposed speed cameras and lower limits</a>, saying the speed is &ldquo;too slow&rdquo; on Ocean Parkway. He called for higher speeds, even as families buried their dead.</p><p>A neighbor spoke for many: &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said Ryan Rivera</a>.</p><h3 id=what-now-the-only-way-out-is-through>What Now: The Only Way Out Is Through</h3><p><strong>This is not an accident. It is a policy failure.</strong> Every day of delay means another family waits for a call that never should come. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand action, not excuses.</strong></p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not washed away by words. Only by change.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Steel and stone replace painted lines.</p><p class=mb3>The Brooklyn Paper reported on June 11, 2025, that NYC DOT will redesign intersections to protect cyclists and pedestrians. The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. The move highlights the city's shift from painted lines to physical infrastructure, aiming to reduce systemic risk for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, four years in the making, aimed to address high crash rates and poor bike network coverage. Vernikov announced, 'Happy to say as a result of our conversations and advocacy, @NYC_DOT is PAUSING implementation of bike lanes.' Despite near-unanimous community board support and DOT's safety pledges, Vernikov opposed the project, calling it a 'woke agenda.' Only a portion of the lanes will proceed. Safety analysts warn: 'Opposition to even basic bike infrastructure like painted lanes discourages mode shift, reduces safety in numbers, and maintains street conditions that are inequitable and dangerous for vulnerable road users.'
