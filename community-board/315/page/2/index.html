Police made an arrest.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published June 19, 2025), Chaquasia Pigford was arrested and charged with murder, manslaughter, reckless driving, unlicensed operation, and leaving the scene after allegedly killing Tiffany Cifuni on May 24 in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Prosecutors say Pigford rear-ended Cifuni, then stopped two blocks away. When Cifuni approached, Pigford 'refused to roll down her window or speak,' then accelerated, striking and dragging Cifuni. The article quotes Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle.' Pigford then made an illegal turn and fled. The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run driving and the dangers posed by unlicensed, reckless drivers operating stolen vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city had announced the removal would happen by the end of June. The order blocks any changes until a court hearing on August 6. According to NY1, the restraining order 'prevents the city from altering three blocks of a protected lane along Bedford Avenue, on the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant and South Williamsburg.'

The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use. Safety analysts note congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and supports safer, more equitable streets.

The measure, sponsored by Senator Jamaal Bailey, excludes violations in cooperative housing developments with at least 10,000 Mitchell-Lama units from bus operation traffic regulations. The bill advanced through committee and received broad support in both chambers. By exempting these large complexes, the law weakens traffic enforcement where thousands live. This move increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, stripping away protections that save lives. Vulnerable road users lose another layer of safety in dense city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Two police officers and two SUV passengers were hospitalized in stable condition. One person was taken into custody, though no charges were filed at the time of reporting.

The move follows complaints from local residents, especially after a viral video showed a child running into the lane from a double-parked car and colliding with an e-bike. Adams stated, 'we listened to community concerns and decided to adjust the current design to better reflect community feedback.' The Department of Transportation will revert the protected lane to its previous unprotected state between Willoughby and Flushing avenues. The article highlights ongoing political battles over street design and notes that double-parking and chaotic traffic remain unaddressed. Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro cited 'lack of action' on e-bike safety as a barrier to safer infrastructure. The decision removes a key safety measure for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
