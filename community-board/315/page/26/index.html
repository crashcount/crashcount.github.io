Their action signals strong legislative momentum. The bill’s focus: force planners to build streets for people, not just cars. No safety analyst note is available, but the intent is clear—systemic change for vulnerable road users.

Diego Andrade, a pedestrian, was killed by the driver of a 2016 Mack sanitation truck turning left at E. 14th Street. The driver remained at the scene and faced no charges. The incident happened along a stretch with a history of frequent crashes—41 reported in the previous year on just ten blocks, injuring 13 pedestrians and one cyclist. The Department of Transportation has not addressed the dangers of this corridor since at least 2009. Residents voiced fear and frustration, calling drivers 'crazy' and demanding city action. The area’s councilmember, Inna Vernikov, has a record of repeated speeding violations, adding to the climate of danger.
