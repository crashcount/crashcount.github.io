They never made it home. An Audi, driven by a woman with a suspended license and over 93 violations, mounted the curb on Ocean Parkway. Three dead. A four-year-old boy, crushed but alive, taken to the hospital. The driver stayed at the scene. The mayor called for answers. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/glam-wigmaker-accused-of-killing-mom-2-young-kids-in-horror-brooklyn-crash-charged-with-manslaughter/>&ldquo;This tragedy demands answers,&rdquo;</a> he said. The answers never come fast enough.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people died</strong> in Brooklyn CB15. <strong>Nine suffered serious injuries</strong>. <strong>827 were hurt.</strong> Children are not spared. Two of the dead were under 18. Their lives ended in the crosswalk, with the signal, by the book. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks, taxis, buses.</strong> They do the most damage. In this district, cars and trucks killed seven. Taxis killed four. Buses, one. The old and the young are struck down. An 87-year-old man pinned under an MTA bus at East 12th and Avenue Z. Police found him at dusk, under the wheels. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>&ldquo;Officers discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus,&rdquo;</a> the report said. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The mayor says, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/glam-wigmaker-accused-of-killing-mom-2-young-kids-in-horror-brooklyn-crash-charged-with-manslaughter/>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> But the law that could have stopped the Audi—one that would force repeat offenders off the road—lapsed. No new law. No new protection. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark. The council and Albany wait. The dead do not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand real consequences for drivers who kill and maim. Do not wait for another child’s name in the news. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
