The bill, introduced January 8, 2025, in the New York State Assembly, is titled: "Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles." Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage. Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes.

The matter, titled 'Mobility tax, other fees to prop up flailing MTA even after congestion toll — but Hochul’s plans remain secret,' centers on Governor Hochul’s undisclosed plans to hike the payroll mobility tax and add new fees, even after a $9 congestion toll. Vernikov, mentioned as a strong opponent, said, 'Governor Hochul has gifted the MTA free reign to grift NYC taxpayers into subsidizing their every irresponsible whim.' The bill’s status remains uncertain, with the state legislature previously rejecting a similar tax hike. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

The driver, described as speeding, dragged Foster for half a mile before leaving him near Linden Blvd. and Nostrand Ave. The article quotes a witness: "I saw him at the stop light. He would go out to the cars and beg for change." The driver fled the scene and has not been caught. No arrests have been made. The incident highlights the lethal risk for pedestrians in city streets and the ongoing issue of hit-and-run drivers evading responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill summary reads: 'Requires the consideration of complete street design for certain transportation projects which receive federal or state funding; authorizes the department to compile and make publicly available guidance and reference material related to consideration of complete street design.' This measure would require state and federally funded transportation projects to consider designs that protect all road users, not just drivers.
