The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented.

Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage. Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes.

The bill pushes agencies to publish clear guidance. Streets built for cars alone kill. This bill aims to force change at the blueprint.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill 324 was introduced on January 1, 2025, and is in the sponsorship stage. The bill sits in the New York State Assembly, with Didi Barrett as the primary sponsor and a long list of co-sponsors, including Rebecca Seawright, Amy Paulin, and others. The bill summary reads: 'Requires the consideration of complete street design for certain transportation projects which receive federal or state funding; authorizes the department to compile and make publicly available guidance and reference material related to consideration of complete street design.' This measure would require state and federally funded transportation projects to consider designs that protect all road users, not just drivers. The bill’s broad sponsorship signals growing support for safer, more inclusive streets. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill blocks sales to unlicensed buyers. It aims to regulate e-scooters but leaves questions for those on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill 116, now in sponsorship, sits in the Assembly. Filed January 1, 2025, it seeks to 'establish a bicycle and electric scooter operator's safety manual; provide for the issuance of a license for residents who successfully read and comprehend the operator's safety manual; require residents who operate an electric scooter in New York City to have a license to operate such devices; require instruction in electric scooter safety as part of the drivers pre-licensing course; require liability insurance for electric scooters in cities having a population of one million or more; prohibit the sale of an electric scooter to a purchaser unless the purchaser has a license to operate the electric scooter and has insurance in a city having a population of one million or more.' Assemblymember John Zaccaro Jr. leads sponsorship, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Michael Benedetto, Deborah Glick, David McDonough, and Michael Novakhov. The bill targets e-scooter operators, not drivers of larger vehicles. No safety analyst has assessed its impact on pedestrians or cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
