The point of impact was the SUV’s left front bumper and the moped’s center front end. The moped driver, a 50-year-old man, was injured with contusions and bruises to his knee, lower leg, and foot. He was conscious and not ejected from the vehicle. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor, specifically pointing to the SUV driver’s failure to maintain attention.
