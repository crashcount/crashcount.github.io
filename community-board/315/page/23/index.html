The announcement followed a $7.25-million federal grant for planning. The mayor said, "You can't force feed this on community residents. It's about conversation, it's about engagement." Assembly Member Michael Novakhov voiced concerns for drivers, saying, "I have some concerns about the drivers of the regular cars." Hunter Armstrong of the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative called for more investment and better maintenance. The mayor did not specify funding, locations, or a timeline. The routes will be chosen through community engagement. Advocates welcomed the promise but criticized the lack of detail and ambition. City Hall did not answer questions on cost or schedule. Vulnerable road users wait for action, not words.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
