Since 2022, <strong>13 people have died</strong> here. <strong>Eighteen more suffered serious injuries</strong>. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a voice that will never answer.</p><p><strong>Just this June</strong>, a 70-year-old man was killed by a bus on Woodhaven Boulevard. He was not at an intersection. He did not make it home. The city’s data does not record his name, only his age and the way he died, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In April last year, a 78-year-old woman was struck and killed by a moped while crossing Grand Avenue.

She will not be the last.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> Cars and trucks are the main killers—<strong>at least 454 injuries and 2 deaths</strong>.

School speed zone rules in New York City get extended. Lawmakers make technical fixes. The bill keeps pressure on drivers near schools. Streets stay a little safer for kids.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 8344, titled 'Extends provisions and makes technical corrections to school speed zones in NYC; repealer,' moved through the Senate and Assembly in June 2025. Sponsored by Senator Andrew Gounardes, the bill passed Senate votes on June 12 and June 13, and cleared the Assembly on June 17. The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly.

Fast riders pushed to Northern Boulevard. Advocates want a park, not a racetrack. Critics warn the move may hurt cycling and safety. Cars still threaten. Pedestrians, cyclists, and kids wait for real protection.</p><p class=mb3>On June 17, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the city’s $89-million redesign proposal for the 34th Avenue open street. The plan, discussed with Council Member Shekar Krishnan and groups like the Alliance for Paseo Park, aims to move fast e-bikes and mopeds to a new lane on Northern Boulevard. The matter summary reads: 'Supporters of the 34th Avenue open street hope design changes can help calm the strip and redirect faster riders to a safer Northern Boulevard.' Dawn Siff and Jim Burke spoke for more park space and bike access. The safety analyst warns: 'Redirecting faster riders away from an open street may discourage cycling and reduce safety in numbers, while failing to address the root causes of unsafe speeds through infrastructure or traffic calming for all users.' The redesign risks pushing danger elsewhere, not solving it.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
