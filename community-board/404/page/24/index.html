They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a voice that will never answer.</p><p><strong>Just this June</strong>, a 70-year-old man was killed by a bus on Woodhaven Boulevard. He was not at an intersection. He did not make it home. The city’s data does not record his name, only his age and the way he died, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In April last year, a 78-year-old woman was struck and killed by a moped while crossing Grand Avenue.

She will not be the last.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> Cars and trucks are the main killers—<strong>at least 454 injuries and 2 deaths</strong>.

The city moves on.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have spoken.

Over 20 surpass 2019 numbers. Riders are workers, immigrants, people of color. MTA tweaks service—adds some, cuts some. Waits grow. Calls mount for more funding. Riders need frequent trains. Lives depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2023, Comptroller Tom DiNapoli reported that more than 20 New York City subway stations exceeded pre-pandemic ridership in December 2022. The recovery, strongest in outer boroughs and Upper Manhattan, highlights the reliance of working-class, immigrant, and communities of color on transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber said, 'these New Yorkers deserve the same frequent, safe reliable service that they've come to depend on over time.' State Sen. Jessica Ramos, representing the 7 train corridor, demanded state funding for six-minute off-peak service, noting, 'my neighbors are the ones who do work that they can't do from home.' The MTA has made service adjustments—some lines see more weekend trains, but peak service is trimmed, leading to longer waits. As total ridership lags, agency leaders and advocates warn that cuts hit those who need transit most. The fight for reliable, frequent service continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The editorial slams the plan’s $638 million price tag and attacks its supporters. No mention of safety. The fight is about money, not lives on the street.</p><p class=mb3>On December 16, 2022, an editorial targeted State Senator Michael Gianaris (District 12) for supporting a proposal to make all New York City buses free by 2026. The piece, titled 'Sen. Gianaris’ latest ‘bust the MTA’ budget idiocy,' appeared in the New York Post. It claims the plan would add $638 million a year to the MTA’s deficits and criticizes the idea as reckless. Gianaris, along with Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, is called out for joining the push. The editorial’s focus is fiscal: 'making all city buses free by 2026... would add an estimated $638 million a year to the MTA’s multi-billion dollar deficits.' There is no assessment of how this policy would affect vulnerable road users. The debate here is about budgets, not street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan aims to make transit faster, cheaper, and safer for all riders.</p><p class=mb3>On December 14, 2022, Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris introduced the Formula Three Act, a legislative proposal to overhaul MTA funding and fare policy. The plan, part of the larger Fix The MTA Package, would phase in free local and Select Bus Service, increase bus frequency by 20%, freeze fares, and expand permanent bus lane camera enforcement. Funding would rise from $200 million in 2023 to $638 million in 2026, with $488 million yearly for more buses and $300 million annually for frequent subways. Mamdani called the proposal 'urgent and necessary,' stressing that 'seniors, working class New Yorkers, people who use the bus the most are able to do so without fear of being priced out.' Gianaris said, 'incrementalism...is not working.' The lawmakers urge bold action to ensure public transit is accessible, affordable, and excellent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
