Seventeen with injuries so serious they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, two more lives ended, five more left with wounds that will not heal. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Children are not spared. <strong>Fifty-four injured, one seriously, under eighteen.</strong> The old are not spared. <strong>Thirteen injuries for those over seventy-five.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are families waiting for a voice at the door, a phone that will not ring.</p><h3 id=what-hits-hurts-and-kills>What Hits, Hurts, and Kills</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapon.</strong> They killed two, left sixty-seven with moderate injuries, eight with wounds called serious. Trucks and buses killed one, left five more broken. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, hurt four. Bikes killed one, left six with injuries. The street does not care who you are. It only cares that you are in the way.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The city talks of cameras, of lower speed limits, of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can set 20 mph limits.</strong> But the limit is not yet set. The cameras that catch speeders may go dark if Albany does not act. The city says it wants zero deaths. The city waits.</p><p>In Queens CB4, the waiting costs lives. The council can lower the speed limit now. The mayor can push. The state can keep the cameras running. <strong>Every day of delay is another day for a child to bleed in the crosswalk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand the cameras stay on.</strong> Join the groups that fight for the dead and the living.

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a speeding driver in 2013, would let the city lower limits to 20 mph. The matter, described as 'Let New York City lower its own speed limits,' has strong support from the mayor, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, and advocates like Families for Safe Streets. Restler’s action was public advocacy. The Assembly is the final hurdle; the bill is already in the governor’s and Senate’s budgets. Advocates cite a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit change. Families demand action to prevent more deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say low fees fuel car ownership, crowding out transit, bikes, and green space. Experts warn it’s a subsidy for drivers, not a fix for congestion or emissions.</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2023, a Senate proposal surfaced to create a Residential Parking Permit system in New York City. The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The total cost is about $500 million, far less than any rail option. State Senator Jessica Ramos, district 13, praised the decision, saying, 'My neighbors who live around LaGuardia deserve transit that is for them, not whatever that boondoggle was.'

The incident sparked a petition—over 26,000 signatures—calling for traffic lights to replace stop signs at three crossings. Gianaris pledged to 'make sure we fix Newtown Road where this happened, and to honor her father's request that there be traffic lights there.' The Department of Transportation upgraded crosswalk markings but has not committed to a traffic light, citing a low crash history. Residents and the victim’s family say the intersection remains dangerous, with drivers ignoring stop signs. Gianaris’s support highlights official recognition of the need for stronger protections for pedestrians, especially children, at this site.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
