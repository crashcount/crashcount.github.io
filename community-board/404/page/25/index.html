The visit drew Council Member Shekar Krishnan, who lobbied Adams to convert the street into a permanent, car-free linear park. Krishnan said, 'I advocated for a linear park and how transformative it would be for our city.' Despite Adams’ past support—he once signed a petition for the park—he made no commitments during the visit. Funding for the conversion and for Citi Bike expansion was left out of the Department of Transportation budget. DOT and City Hall offered no clear answers on future plans or funding. The future of 34th Avenue’s open street remains uncertain, leaving vulnerable road users waiting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Injuries to walkers and cyclists nearly vanished. In two years, reported crashes dropped 77 percent. Injuries dropped 89 percent. Advocates and city leaders now push for permanent car bans and parks. Data leaves no doubt.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy, highlighted in a Streetsblog NYC report dated January 11, 2022, focuses on the 34th Avenue open street. The Department of Transportation and Council Member Shekar Krishnan back a permanent car-free linear park. Mayor Adams has signed the petition. The article states: 'When cars are banished from roadways, total crashes drop dramatically and injuries to pedestrians and cyclists almost entirely disappear.' Luz Maria Mercado and Transportation Alternatives support expanding open streets citywide. DOT spokesman Seth Stein says, 'by reclaiming space from cars we make our streets safer.' The data is stark: from 2019 to 2021, crashes during open street hours fell from 26 to 6, injuries from 19 to 2. The evidence is clear—removing cars saves lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
