They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a voice that will never answer.</p><p><strong>Just this June</strong>, a 70-year-old man was killed by a bus on Woodhaven Boulevard. He was not at an intersection. He did not make it home. The city’s data does not record his name, only his age and the way he died, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In April last year, a 78-year-old woman was struck and killed by a moped while crossing Grand Avenue.

The city moves on.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have spoken.

Michael Gianaris shrugs off GOP outrage. The fight centers on drivers, but the city’s streets remain deadly for those on foot and bike. The toll’s impact on safety goes unmentioned.</p><p class=mb3>On December 3, 2023, partisan lines hardened over New York’s congestion pricing law. The $15 toll, set to hit drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street, became a political weapon. State Sen. Michael Gianaris, mentioned in the debate, dismissed Republican attacks as ineffective. The measure, approved in 2019 by Democrats, aims to raise $1 billion for mass transit and reduce traffic. GOP figures like Nicole Malliotakis and Michael Lawler call it a 'burdensome tax' and 'outrageous cash grab.' Mayor Eric Adams seeks exemptions for medical trips. The bill’s matter title frames it as a major election issue: 'NY GOP eager to pin $15 congestion tax on Democrats in 2024 elections.' No safety analyst has assessed its impact on vulnerable road users. The debate centers on drivers and politics, not on the lives at risk in city crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He promises green space and bike lanes. Renderings show paths, but crossing the Grand Central Parkway stays deadly. Locals want safer streets, not slots. Lawmakers push for community input. The fight for access continues.</p><p class=mb3>Billionaire Mets owner Steve Cohen has proposed a major redevelopment of the Citi Field parking lot, including a Hard Rock casino, public park, plaza, bike lanes, and a renovated train station. The plan, called 'Metropolitan Park,' was unveiled on November 7, 2023. Assembly Member Jeffrey Aubrion introduced a bill to enable construction by 'alienating' parkland, but State Sen. Jessica Ramos, the local representative, remains skeptical. Ramos said, 'I didn't think a casino is necessary to redevelop the parking lot or create a safer pathway from 34th Street to the baseball stadium,' and stressed the need for community input: 'It's important that my neighbors look carefully at the proposal and we'll continue together with our process.' Public visioning sessions showed residents want better bike and transit connections, not gambling. The proposal highlights new bike lanes on Roosevelt Avenue and Boat Basin Place, but fails to address the hazardous crossing at Grand Central Parkway for cyclists and pedestrians. Details on funding and implementation remain unclear.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
