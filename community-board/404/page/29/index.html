They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a voice that will never answer.</p><p><strong>Just this June</strong>, a 70-year-old man was killed by a bus on Woodhaven Boulevard. He was not at an intersection. He did not make it home. The city’s data does not record his name, only his age and the way he died, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In April last year, a 78-year-old woman was struck and killed by a moped while crossing Grand Avenue.

The toll mounts.</p><p class=mb3>On August 17, 2022, State Senator Michael Gianaris called for urgent pedestrian safety improvements after a deadly hit-and-run in Queens. The incident, which killed 74-year-old Be Tran at Myrtle and Seneca Avenues, triggered public outcry. Gianaris criticized the city’s process, saying, 'They have to wait until that happens to get the score high enough to realize that an intersection needs protection.' He joined activists from the Ridgewood Tenants Union and Transportation Alternatives, demanding new signals and better street design. Gianaris said he contacted the Department of Transportation a year earlier with no result. The city claims over 20 traffic control approvals in Ridgewood, but residents and advocates say it’s not enough. The call comes as pedestrian deaths and injuries continue to climb citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
