Seventeen with injuries so serious they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, two more lives ended, five more left with wounds that will not heal. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Children are not spared. <strong>Fifty-four injured, one seriously, under eighteen.</strong> The old are not spared. <strong>Thirteen injuries for those over seventy-five.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are families waiting for a voice at the door, a phone that will not ring.</p><h3 id=what-hits-hurts-and-kills>What Hits, Hurts, and Kills</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapon.</strong> They killed two, left sixty-seven with moderate injuries, eight with wounds called serious. Trucks and buses killed one, left five more broken. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, hurt four. Bikes killed one, left six with injuries. The street does not care who you are. It only cares that you are in the way.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The city talks of cameras, of lower speed limits, of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can set 20 mph limits.</strong> But the limit is not yet set. The cameras that catch speeders may go dark if Albany does not act. The city says it wants zero deaths. The city waits.</p><p>In Queens CB4, the waiting costs lives. The council can lower the speed limit now. The mayor can push. The state can keep the cameras running. <strong>Every day of delay is another day for a child to bleed in the crosswalk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand the cameras stay on.</strong> Join the groups that fight for the dead and the living.

The pause threatens subway and bus service. Advocates demand any replacement funds boost operations, not highways. Riders need frequent, affordable transit—not more gridlock and pollution.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published October 1, 2024, addresses Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing and seek alternative funding for the MTA’s $15-billion capital plan. The article states: “If the governor wants to do the MTA and riders a favor, she should use the money she finds to instead boost MTA operations.” Author Samuel Santaella criticizes Hochul’s move, arguing it jeopardizes service for working-class New Yorkers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris are cited as proponents of fare-free buses, while Riders Alliance pushes for six-minute service. The piece urges Hochul to reject highway expansions and instead invest in frequent, affordable transit. The editorial frames this as a fight for clean air, equity, and safety for all New Yorkers who rely on public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Parents begged for help. The city stalled. Jessica Ramos backs a bill for a guard at every school corner. She calls for daylighting, scrambles, and less congestion. The city’s response: not enough. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On September 27, 2024, State Senator Jessica Ramos, representing Queens District 13, called for urgent action after two students were killed in traffic near P.S. 127. The matter, titled 'Queens parents struggle to get crossing guards after 2 students killed in traffic,' highlights a dire shortage: only 1,500 crossing guards citywide, down from 2,600 in 2019. Ramos supports a bill mandating a crossing guard at every school corner and urges investment in pedestrian scrambles, daylighting, and congestion reduction. She said, 'You would think that this is one of the most basic ways to protect the safety of our children. And yet that seems like an insurmountable task.' Ramos’s advocacy comes as parents face bureaucratic stonewalling and city officials offer piecemeal fixes. The city’s measures—stop signs, bollards, and cement blocks—fall short. Ramos demands full funding and systemic change to protect children on their way to school.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
