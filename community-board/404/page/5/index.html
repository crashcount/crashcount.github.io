The city talks of cameras, of lower speed limits, of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can set 20 mph limits.</strong> But the limit is not yet set. The cameras that catch speeders may go dark if Albany does not act. The city says it wants zero deaths. The city waits.</p><p>In Queens CB4, the waiting costs lives. The council can lower the speed limit now. The mayor can push.

The report does not specify any driver contributing factors or errors, nor does it attribute any fault to the pedestrian.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1142-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced December 19, 2024. The bill is titled, "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing child with autism warning plaques on streets." Council Member Kevin C. Riley is the primary sponsor, joined by Ariola, Joseph, Moya, Won, Banks, Narcisse, Paladino, and Marmorato. Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children. The city continues to rely on signage, not street redesign, to address systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
