Seventeen with injuries so serious they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, two more lives ended, five more left with wounds that will not heal. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Children are not spared. <strong>Fifty-four injured, one seriously, under eighteen.</strong> The old are not spared. <strong>Thirteen injuries for those over seventy-five.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are families waiting for a voice at the door, a phone that will not ring.</p><h3 id=what-hits-hurts-and-kills>What Hits, Hurts, and Kills</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapon.</strong> They killed two, left sixty-seven with moderate injuries, eight with wounds called serious. Trucks and buses killed one, left five more broken. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, hurt four. Bikes killed one, left six with injuries. The street does not care who you are. It only cares that you are in the way.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The city talks of cameras, of lower speed limits, of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can set 20 mph limits.</strong> But the limit is not yet set. The cameras that catch speeders may go dark if Albany does not act. The city says it wants zero deaths. The city waits.</p><p>In Queens CB4, the waiting costs lives. The council can lower the speed limit now. The mayor can push. The state can keep the cameras running. <strong>Every day of delay is another day for a child to bleed in the crosswalk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand the cameras stay on.</strong> Join the groups that fight for the dead and the living.

The white Toyota sedan hit an underpass near 225th Street around 3:50 a.m. Both occupants were found outside the wreck when police arrived.

The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive.

The measure, now in committee, targets riders not already covered by helmet laws. The city’s car carnage continues. Lawmakers focus on headgear, not street danger.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1173-2025 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after introduction on January 23, 2025. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of New York, in relation to requiring bicyclists to wear protective headgear,' would require every cyclist not already mandated by other laws to wear a helmet. Violators face civil penalties up to $50. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Council Members Holden, Vernikov, Narcisse, Moya, Schulman, Louis, Hanks, Brannan, and Zhuang. The bill does not address the root causes of cyclist injuries: reckless drivers, speeding cars, and deadly streets. Instead, it shifts responsibility onto those most at risk, leaving the city’s dangerous roads unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
