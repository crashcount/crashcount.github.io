They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a voice that will never answer.</p><p><strong>Just this June</strong>, a 70-year-old man was killed by a bus on Woodhaven Boulevard. He was not at an intersection. He did not make it home. The city’s data does not record his name, only his age and the way he died, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In April last year, a 78-year-old woman was struck and killed by a moped while crossing Grand Avenue.

Stringer demanded 'massive expansion of protected bike lanes.' Myrie backed S1047, a bill for 50-percent e-bike rebates. Ramos called for safe bike lanes and clear signage for all riders. Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, featured Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Whitney Tilson. Stringer pledged to move the city away from car dependence and build infrastructure for biking and transit. Myrie called for removing parking mandates to boost housing and speed up buses. Ramos supported repurposing parking for safer streets and green space. Lander pushed for eliminating parking minimums citywide and dynamic curbside management. Mamdani criticized the vast space given to cars. Only Tilson promised to preserve free street parking. The candidates’ stances show a clear divide: most want to reclaim streets for people, not vehicles. The debate signals a shift toward policies that could reduce car dominance and improve safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s fate now rests with the next mayor, as Adams’s plan delays long-term decisions. The City Council, led by Parks Committee Chair Shekar Krishnan, urges Adams to secure the program’s future, warning, "future mayors don’t inherit a decimated program." Comptroller Brad Lander and several Democratic mayoral candidates support expansion. Ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a leading candidate, offers only a case-by-case review. Advocates and organizers say the current funding is inadequate, calling it a "token show of support" and demanding $48 million over three years.
