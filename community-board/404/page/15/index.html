Seventeen with injuries so serious they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, two more lives ended, five more left with wounds that will not heal. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Children are not spared. <strong>Fifty-four injured, one seriously, under eighteen.</strong> The old are not spared. <strong>Thirteen injuries for those over seventy-five.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are families waiting for a voice at the door, a phone that will not ring.</p><h3 id=what-hits-hurts-and-kills>What Hits, Hurts, and Kills</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapon.</strong> They killed two, left sixty-seven with moderate injuries, eight with wounds called serious. Trucks and buses killed one, left five more broken. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, hurt four. Bikes killed one, left six with injuries. The street does not care who you are. It only cares that you are in the way.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The city talks of cameras, of lower speed limits, of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can set 20 mph limits.</strong> But the limit is not yet set. The cameras that catch speeders may go dark if Albany does not act. The city says it wants zero deaths. The city waits.</p><p>In Queens CB4, the waiting costs lives. The council can lower the speed limit now. The mayor can push. The state can keep the cameras running. <strong>Every day of delay is another day for a child to bleed in the crosswalk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand the cameras stay on.</strong> Join the groups that fight for the dead and the living.

Council Member Alexa Aviles demanded rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and resources for workers. State Sen. Jessica Ramos blamed app companies for shifting costs onto underpaid deliveristas. Advocacy leaders like Carl Mahaney rejected crackdowns, calling for dedicated space instead. Jon Orcutt criticized City Hall’s blindspot on traffic rules. The debate centered on expanding bike lanes, building charging infrastructure, holding tech companies accountable, and buyback programs for unsafe batteries.

The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C. Carroll, and Sarahana Shrestha. The bill cracks down on repeat offenders, forcing them to install technology that blocks speeding.

The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The city’s crosswalks remain unchanged. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
