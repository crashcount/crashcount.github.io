The city talks of cameras, of lower speed limits, of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can set 20 mph limits.</strong> But the limit is not yet set. The cameras that catch speeders may go dark if Albany does not act. The city says it wants zero deaths. The city waits.</p><p>In Queens CB4, the waiting costs lives. The council can lower the speed limit now. The mayor can push.

The meeting followed a deadly year: a 75-year-old man killed by an e-bike, two injured in a dirt bike crash. Residents described near-misses and constant danger on the 34th Avenue open street. The matter, titled 'On Jackson Heights’ open street, NYC’s ‘moped crisis’ is in full throttle,' drew city officials, including DOT and Mayor Adams, who backed enforcement and moped registration. Krishnan slammed DOT’s reliance on signage, pushing instead for a dedicated micromobility lane. Delivery worker advocates opposed criminalization, demanding labor protections and safe infrastructure. Despite new signs and vehicle seizures, mopeds still speed through.

At a 'Moped Crisis' town hall, Krishnan called the area a 'moped highway' and said, 'The biggest problem that we have is poor design by the DOT.' He demanded a redesign that separates speeding vehicles from people and creates safe corridors for mopeds away from recreational spaces. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas echoed the call for engineering solutions, stating, 'We must design the roads to ensure that mopeds are not getting on [Paseo Park], and are not driving recklessly.' DOT staff highlighted enforcement efforts, but Krishnan and others insisted that design, not enforcement, must come first.

Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, state lawmakers, led by Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, responded to Governor Hochul’s sudden suspension of Manhattan’s congestion pricing plan. The Legislature rejected Hochul’s push for a payroll tax hike, then considered a vague $1 billion IOU for the MTA, with no funding source. Gianaris told reporters the proposal would simply promise a billion dollars for the next year’s budget, but offered no details. The bill has not been introduced or assigned to committee. Betsy Plum of the Riders Alliance warned, 'The proposal on the table will not fix the subway. A billion dollar IOU is not nearly enough money nor is it nearly secure enough to build trust and rebuild our critical infrastructure.' With no new revenue, the MTA’s ability to fund repairs and upgrades remains in doubt. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders—face continued danger as safe, reliable alternatives to driving are left unfunded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposed measure, still without a bill number or final language, would guarantee $1 billion annually for the MTA over 15 years. State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris explained, “It’s very simply something that just says there will be a billion dollars for the MTA in the following year’s budget, but without any specifics as to what that means.” Gianaris and others are working with Hochul and the MTA to keep capital projects alive. The bill’s fate is unclear, with some lawmakers already planning to vote no. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

The city waits for the governor’s pen.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill S 8607, titled 'Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Kingston,' passed the Senate on June 6, 2024, and the Assembly on June 7, 2024. The bill sits in committee, awaiting further action. Senator Michelle Hinchey (District 41) sponsored the measure. The bill summary states: 'Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Kingston; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2029.' Votes in both chambers showed strong support, with some opposition. The program targets reckless driving near schools, aiming to protect children and other vulnerable road users from speeding cars. The demonstration will run until the end of 2029, testing the impact of automated enforcement in Kingston.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They say MTA left Queens behind. Riders in transit deserts face long, costly trips. Lawmakers call the exclusion unacceptable. They want fair service before new fees begin.</p><p class=mb3>On May 16, 2024, ten Queens lawmakers, including Julia Salazar (District 18), urged the MTA to expand express bus service to Queens before the $15 Manhattan congestion toll starts. The group wrote to MTA chairman Janno Lieber, stating, "Express buses play a vital role in Queens’ public transit network and only stand to become even more pivotal in the near and distant future." They criticized the MTA for boosting express bus service in Brooklyn and Staten Island but not Queens, calling the exclusion "unacceptable." The lawmakers stressed that many southeast and northeast Queens residents lack subway access and rely on express buses to reach Midtown. They argued the 10 percent LIRR discount is no substitute for robust bus service. Salazar and her colleagues support congestion pricing but insist its success depends on expanded, equitable transit for all vulnerable riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
