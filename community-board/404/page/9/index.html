They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a voice that will never answer.</p><p><strong>Just this June</strong>, a 70-year-old man was killed by a bus on Woodhaven Boulevard. He was not at an intersection. He did not make it home. The city’s data does not record his name, only his age and the way he died, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In April last year, a 78-year-old woman was struck and killed by a moped while crossing Grand Avenue.

She will not be the last.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> Cars and trucks are the main killers—<strong>at least 454 injuries and 2 deaths</strong>.

The city moves on.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have spoken.

The driver was making a left turn when the collision occurred, impacting the pedestrian with the vehicle’s center front end. The pedestrian sustained abrasions to his knee, lower leg, and foot and remained conscious after the crash. The report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor to the crash, repeated twice, emphasizing the driver’s failure to notice the pedestrian. No pedestrian fault or contributing factors were noted. The driver was licensed and operating a 2022 Honda sedan.
