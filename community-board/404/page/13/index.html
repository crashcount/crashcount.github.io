Seventeen with injuries so serious they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, two more lives ended, five more left with wounds that will not heal. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Children are not spared. <strong>Fifty-four injured, one seriously, under eighteen.</strong> The old are not spared. <strong>Thirteen injuries for those over seventy-five.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are families waiting for a voice at the door, a phone that will not ring.</p><h3 id=what-hits-hurts-and-kills>What Hits, Hurts, and Kills</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapon.</strong> They killed two, left sixty-seven with moderate injuries, eight with wounds called serious. Trucks and buses killed one, left five more broken. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, hurt four. Bikes killed one, left six with injuries. The street does not care who you are. It only cares that you are in the way.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The city talks of cameras, of lower speed limits, of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can set 20 mph limits.</strong> But the limit is not yet set. The cameras that catch speeders may go dark if Albany does not act. The city says it wants zero deaths. The city waits.</p><p>In Queens CB4, the waiting costs lives. The council can lower the speed limit now. The mayor can push. The state can keep the cameras running. <strong>Every day of delay is another day for a child to bleed in the crosswalk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand the cameras stay on.</strong> Join the groups that fight for the dead and the living.

The group called for expanded lifeguard hours, more staff, and new public pools. The Adams administration rejected these measures, relying instead on NYPD drones and Parks Enforcement Patrols. The matter, described as 'Body found in fifth apparent drowning off NYC beach as pols call for more lifeguard hours,' highlights the deadly gap in city safety policy. Brannan, along with Council Member Shekar Krishnan and Borough Presidents Donovan Richards and Antonio Reynoso, urged the city to extend the beach season, increase lifeguard shifts, and offer universal swimming lessons. The city has only 870 lifeguards, far short of the 1,500 needed. Vulnerable swimmers remain at risk while officials debate.

Lawmakers say this closes loopholes, shifts blame from workers, and aims to cut rising crashes. Streets see more mopeds, more injuries, more tension.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2024, Governor Hochul signed a package of eight bills into law, including new moped and e-bike safety regulations. The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Action lags.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2024, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan (District 25) convened a town hall in Jackson Heights to address what he called a 'moped crisis.' The meeting followed a deadly year: a 75-year-old man killed by an e-bike, two injured in a dirt bike crash. Residents described near-misses and constant danger on the 34th Avenue open street. The matter, titled 'On Jackson Heights’ open street, NYC’s ‘moped crisis’ is in full throttle,' drew city officials, including DOT and Mayor Adams, who backed enforcement and moped registration. Krishnan slammed DOT’s reliance on signage, pushing instead for a dedicated micromobility lane. Delivery worker advocates opposed criminalization, demanding labor protections and safe infrastructure. Despite new signs and vehicle seizures, mopeds still speed through. The call for urgent, systemic change grows louder.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
