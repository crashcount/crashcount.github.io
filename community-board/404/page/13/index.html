The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors, both attributed to the sedan driver.

Lawmakers say this closes loopholes, shifts blame from workers, and aims to cut rising crashes. Streets see more mopeds, more injuries, more tension.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2024, Governor Hochul signed a package of eight bills into law, including new moped and e-bike safety regulations. The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bicyclist, a 23-year-old male, sustained head abrasions and was conscious after the collision. The report lists no specific contributing factors for the driver or bicyclist, but the sedan’s left turn maneuver directly caused the collision. The bicyclist was not ejected and was riding without safety equipment. The driver’s left turn into the path of the bicyclist created a hazardous situation resulting in injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The meeting followed a deadly year: a 75-year-old man killed by an e-bike, two injured in a dirt bike crash. Residents described near-misses and constant danger on the 34th Avenue open street. The matter, titled 'On Jackson Heights’ open street, NYC’s ‘moped crisis’ is in full throttle,' drew city officials, including DOT and Mayor Adams, who backed enforcement and moped registration. Krishnan slammed DOT’s reliance on signage, pushing instead for a dedicated micromobility lane. Delivery worker advocates opposed criminalization, demanding labor protections and safe infrastructure. Despite new signs and vehicle seizures, mopeds still speed through. The call for urgent, systemic change grows louder.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At a 'Moped Crisis' town hall, Krishnan called the area a 'moped highway' and said, 'The biggest problem that we have is poor design by the DOT.' He demanded a redesign that separates speeding vehicles from people and creates safe corridors for mopeds away from recreational spaces. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas echoed the call for engineering solutions, stating, 'We must design the roads to ensure that mopeds are not getting on [Paseo Park], and are not driving recklessly.' DOT staff highlighted enforcement efforts, but Krishnan and others insisted that design, not enforcement, must come first. DOT claims a drop in pedestrian crashes, but the current layout leaves pedestrians and cyclists exposed to danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
