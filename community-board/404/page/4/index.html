Seventeen with injuries so serious they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, two more lives ended, five more left with wounds that will not heal. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Children are not spared. <strong>Fifty-four injured, one seriously, under eighteen.</strong> The old are not spared. <strong>Thirteen injuries for those over seventy-five.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are families waiting for a voice at the door, a phone that will not ring.</p><h3 id=what-hits-hurts-and-kills>What Hits, Hurts, and Kills</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapon.</strong> They killed two, left sixty-seven with moderate injuries, eight with wounds called serious. Trucks and buses killed one, left five more broken. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, hurt four. Bikes killed one, left six with injuries. The street does not care who you are. It only cares that you are in the way.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The city talks of cameras, of lower speed limits, of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can set 20 mph limits.</strong> But the limit is not yet set. The cameras that catch speeders may go dark if Albany does not act. The city says it wants zero deaths. The city waits.</p><p>In Queens CB4, the waiting costs lives. The council can lower the speed limit now. The mayor can push. The state can keep the cameras running. <strong>Every day of delay is another day for a child to bleed in the crosswalk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand the cameras stay on.</strong> Join the groups that fight for the dead and the living.

The measure, discussed in the council and supported by the NYC Department of Transportation, aims to ticket drivers who double park or block critical spaces. The bill summary states: 'Double parking and curb violations aren’t just a nuisance – they’re a public safety hazard.' Raga and DOT officials argue that manual enforcement cannot keep up with rising car numbers, leaving pedestrians and cyclists at risk. Raga led the push, highlighting blocked hydrants and crosswalks as threats. DOT said automated enforcement 'helps keep streets clear, reduces congestion, and protects New Yorkers.' Delivery drivers voiced concern about work impacts, but the bill’s focus remains on clearing space for vulnerable road users. The proposal awaits further council action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assemblymember Steven Raga leads the push for a $35 million pilot, aiming to install 150 cameras targeting double parking and illegal stops. The bill, not yet assigned a committee or number, seeks to automate enforcement where manual efforts fall short. Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead. The Department of Transportation supports the expansion, stating, 'Automated enforcement has proven to change driver behavior and make our streets safer for everyone.' The debate centers on whether automation or police presence best protects pedestrians and cyclists from blocked lanes and traffic hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment.
