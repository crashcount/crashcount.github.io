Seventeen with injuries so serious they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, two more lives ended, five more left with wounds that will not heal. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Children are not spared. <strong>Fifty-four injured, one seriously, under eighteen.</strong> The old are not spared. <strong>Thirteen injuries for those over seventy-five.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are families waiting for a voice at the door, a phone that will not ring.</p><h3 id=what-hits-hurts-and-kills>What Hits, Hurts, and Kills</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapon.</strong> They killed two, left sixty-seven with moderate injuries, eight with wounds called serious. Trucks and buses killed one, left five more broken. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, hurt four. Bikes killed one, left six with injuries. The street does not care who you are. It only cares that you are in the way.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The city talks of cameras, of lower speed limits, of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can set 20 mph limits.</strong> But the limit is not yet set. The cameras that catch speeders may go dark if Albany does not act. The city says it wants zero deaths. The city waits.</p><p>In Queens CB4, the waiting costs lives. The council can lower the speed limit now. The mayor can push. The state can keep the cameras running. <strong>Every day of delay is another day for a child to bleed in the crosswalk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand the cameras stay on.</strong> Join the groups that fight for the dead and the living.

The toll’s impact on safety goes unmentioned.</p><p class=mb3>On December 3, 2023, partisan lines hardened over New York’s congestion pricing law. The $15 toll, set to hit drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street, became a political weapon. State Sen. Michael Gianaris, mentioned in the debate, dismissed Republican attacks as ineffective. The measure, approved in 2019 by Democrats, aims to raise $1 billion for mass transit and reduce traffic. GOP figures like Nicole Malliotakis and Michael Lawler call it a 'burdensome tax' and 'outrageous cash grab.' Mayor Eric Adams seeks exemptions for medical trips. The bill’s matter title frames it as a major election issue: 'NY GOP eager to pin $15 congestion tax on Democrats in 2024 elections.' No safety analyst has assessed its impact on vulnerable road users. The debate centers on drivers and politics, not on the lives at risk in city crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He promises green space and bike lanes. Renderings show paths, but crossing the Grand Central Parkway stays deadly. Locals want safer streets, not slots. Lawmakers push for community input. The fight for access continues.</p><p class=mb3>Billionaire Mets owner Steve Cohen has proposed a major redevelopment of the Citi Field parking lot, including a Hard Rock casino, public park, plaza, bike lanes, and a renovated train station. The plan, called 'Metropolitan Park,' was unveiled on November 7, 2023. Assembly Member Jeffrey Aubrion introduced a bill to enable construction by 'alienating' parkland, but State Sen. Jessica Ramos, the local representative, remains skeptical. Ramos said, 'I didn't think a casino is necessary to redevelop the parking lot or create a safer pathway from 34th Street to the baseball stadium,' and stressed the need for community input: 'It's important that my neighbors look carefully at the proposal and we'll continue together with our process.' Public visioning sessions showed residents want better bike and transit connections, not gambling. The proposal highlights new bike lanes on Roosevelt Avenue and Boat Basin Place, but fails to address the hazardous crossing at Grand Central Parkway for cyclists and pedestrians. Details on funding and implementation remain unclear.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move aims to cut deadly conflict between cars and kids. Filed at session’s end, the resolution targets peak arrival and dismissal. Sponsors push Albany to act. Streets remain risky.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0792-2023 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 28, 2023, and closed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction. The council’s action highlights the ongoing danger children face on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They argue the vans are vital for Asian communities. Without exemption, fares rise. Commutes get harder. The MTA has not taken a side.</p><p class=mb3>On September 24, 2023, Council Member Christopher Marte joined eight other elected officials in urging the MTA to exempt dollar vans from the upcoming congestion pricing plan. The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers. Assembly Member Grace Lee said, 'They should be exempt from tolls under the congestion pricing plan.' The MTA has not taken a position on the exemption.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT vows to return with a safety plan.</p><p class=mb3>On September 14, 2023, the Department of Transportation held a public street safety workshop in Astoria, Queens, following a surge in traffic violence. The event, covered on September 18, 2023, drew over 200 residents and was organized by Western Queens elected officials. The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal. No formal bill number or committee was cited; the event focused on immediate community engagement and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
