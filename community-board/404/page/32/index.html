They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a voice that will never answer.</p><p><strong>Just this June</strong>, a 70-year-old man was killed by a bus on Woodhaven Boulevard. He was not at an intersection. He did not make it home. The city’s data does not record his name, only his age and the way he died, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In April last year, a 78-year-old woman was struck and killed by a moped while crossing Grand Avenue.

Parks Commissioner Susan Donoghue called the 34th Avenue open street 'absolutely amazing,' but said she cannot unilaterally convert it into a linear park. She stressed the need for interagency cooperation, especially with the Department of Transportation. Council Member Shekar Krishnan, a supporter of the park conversion, said, 'We are so excited to work on transforming it into a linear park for a community that needs it so badly.' Krishnan also called for the Parks budget to be raised to 1 percent of the city budget. Donoghue made no firm commitment, repeating the administration’s focus on collaboration. Budget talks with the mayor continue. No direct safety assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
