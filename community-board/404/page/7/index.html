They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a voice that will never answer.</p><p><strong>Just this June</strong>, a 70-year-old man was killed by a bus on Woodhaven Boulevard. He was not at an intersection. He did not make it home. The city’s data does not record his name, only his age and the way he died, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In April last year, a 78-year-old woman was struck and killed by a moped while crossing Grand Avenue.

The question was sharp. Congestion pricing cuts traffic. What comes after? Candidates must answer. Streets stay deadly. Pedestrians and cyclists wait for action. The city’s future hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2025, Streetsblog NYC launched a mayoral policy debate, pressing candidates on congestion pricing. The event was not a council bill, but a public challenge. Streetsblog asked: 'Now that congestion pricing is operating in New York City, what should the city government do to build on its success in reducing Manhattan traffic?' Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Whitney Tilson responded, each supporting congestion pricing and further transit investment. Streetsblog’s demand was clear—protect vulnerable road users. The safety analyst notes that congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and opens the door for street redesigns that put vulnerable users first. The debate underscores urgency: congestion pricing helps, but more must be done to make streets safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She says the mayor should pick the NYC Transit boss. The push follows years of state failures. Riders face delays, confusion, and a system that ignores their needs.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2025, State Senator Jessica Ramos, representing District 13, announced her support for New York City taking control of its subway system. The current system is run by the state through the MTA. Ramos, a mayoral candidate, said, "I would love for the mayor of the City of New York to be able to appoint the New York City Transit president or to have a greater say in what happens in the system." The announcement came as part of a broader mayoral campaign debate, with other candidates like Brad Lander proposing a city-run authority called 'Big Apple Transit.' The push for city control follows years of service failures and frustration among riders. Ramos’s stance signals a demand for local accountability and a transit system that answers to the people who use it every day. No formal bill number or committee action is attached to this policy announcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Rosen pursued William McField, a 55-year-old motorcyclist, after a minor collision. On Woodhaven Boulevard, Rosen struck McField from behind, ran him over, and continued driving, dragging the motorcycle until it caught fire. Rosen then hit another car before stopping at a lamp post. McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes." The case highlights the lethal risk of aggressive driving and the need for stronger enforcement against road violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The poll, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found deep worry among women, seniors, and Bronx residents. The matter summary reads: '77% of NYC voters consider pedestrian safety a serious issue.' Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death.

The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips. The report adds fuel to the debate over city funding for free bus service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city debates the next step.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2025, a policy analysis highlighted the impact of fare-free buses in New York City. The study, covered by Streetsblog, found that eliminating fares would speed up bus trips by 12 percent and increase annual ridership by 169 million—up 20 percent. The report states: "Fare-free buses would juice bus speeds and ridership while also bringing economic benefits to bus riders themselves." State Senator Michael Gianaris, representing District 12, is mentioned as a supporter. The analysis, led by Charles Komanoff, shows that removing fares slashes dwell times and makes service faster and more reliable. While the shift from cars to buses is modest, the benefits for bus riders are clear: less waiting, more access, and safer streets. The debate over funding and implementation continues in the council.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
