They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a voice that will never answer.</p><p><strong>Just this June</strong>, a 70-year-old man was killed by a bus on Woodhaven Boulevard. He was not at an intersection. He did not make it home. The city’s data does not record his name, only his age and the way he died, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In April last year, a 78-year-old woman was struck and killed by a moped while crossing Grand Avenue.

Scott Stringer calls for 'dedicated bus lanes, more enforcement, more shelters, better curbs, more transit signal priority, all-door boarding, and more frequent off-peak services.' Ramos blasts DOT for building only 23 of 150 mandated bus miles. Myrie pledges to exceed the city’s 30-mile annual target. Lander wants immediate all-door boarding and new busways.

Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Whitney Tilson responded, each supporting congestion pricing and further transit investment.

The current system is run by the state through the MTA. Ramos, a mayoral candidate, said, "I would love for the mayor of the City of New York to be able to appoint the New York City Transit president or to have a greater say in what happens in the system." The announcement came as part of a broader mayoral campaign debate, with other candidates like Brad Lander proposing a city-run authority called 'Big Apple Transit.' The push for city control follows years of service failures and frustration among riders. Ramos’s stance signals a demand for local accountability and a transit system that answers to the people who use it every day.
