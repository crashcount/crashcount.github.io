They are bodies on the pavement, families left waiting for a voice that will never answer.</p><p><strong>Just this June</strong>, a 70-year-old man was killed by a bus on Woodhaven Boulevard. He was not at an intersection. He did not make it home. The city’s data does not record his name, only his age and the way he died, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In April last year, a 78-year-old woman was struck and killed by a moped while crossing Grand Avenue.
