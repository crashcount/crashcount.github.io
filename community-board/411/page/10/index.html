One was a child. One was over 65. One was in the prime of life. Four more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In total, 643 people were hurt in 1,106 crashes in just twelve months. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><p>The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars. A 75-year-old woman was killed crossing 47th Avenue. The cause: driver inattention.

In the last three years, SUVs and cars took two lives and left dozens bleeding. Trucks and vans added to the toll. Bikes and mopeds did not kill anyone here, but they are not immune elsewhere. The street is a field of risk, and the largest machines win.</p><h3 id=the-response-words-laws-and-waiting>The Response: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>City Hall says the right things. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/13/senior-pedestrian-moped-rider-killed-in-separate-nyc-crashes-in-24-hours/>said Mayor Adams</a>.

The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not yet lowered. The law sits. The streets wait. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each delay is another risk. Each day of inaction is another family’s nightmare.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

Council Members Robert F. Holden, Justin L. Brannan, James F. Gennaro (primary sponsor), Farah N. Louis, Vickie Paladino, and David M. Carr back the bill.

Council Member Oswald Feliz leads as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Bottcher, Gennaro, Marte, Restler, Ung, and Paladino.
