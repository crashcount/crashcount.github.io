Twenty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Queens CB11 since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or habit. They only climb.</p><p>Just last month, a 74-year-old man was killed crossing at Northern Boulevard and 217th Street. The driver, behind the wheel of a 2017 SUV, was unlicensed. The man died at the intersection. There is no comfort in the details. There is only the fact of his absence. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On December 24th, a 56-year-old man was crushed and killed as a pedestrian on the Clearview Expressway. The crash was blamed on a driver following too closely, on a slippery road.

One was under 18. The streets do not forgive. SUVs and sedans do most of the damage—four deaths by cars, none by bikes. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, fathers, children.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>State Senator John Liu has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on bills to curb repeat speeders, requiring speed-limiting devices for those with a pattern of violations. He co-sponsored the bill, and he voted yes in committee. This is a step. But the deaths keep coming. Council Member Linda Lee, Assembly Member Ed Braunstein, and others have supported extending school speed zones. It is not enough.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez</a> as the city expanded car-free school streets. The city is moving, but not fast enough. The blood dries before the paint does.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders.

The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers. Assembly Member Grace Lee said, 'They should be exempt from tolls under the congestion pricing plan.' The MTA has not taken a position on the exemption.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
