The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Doug Gordon, writing in Streetsblog NYC, systematically rebuts Paladino’s claims, stating, “Everything Paladino proposes here is unserious, doesn’t exist in any city that has successfully integrated cycling into its transportation system and has been thoroughly debunked going back years.” Gordon cites polling and Department of Transportation data to show broad support for protected bike lanes and the effectiveness of speed cameras. He challenges Paladino’s push for cyclist licensing and increased law enforcement, urging her to listen to transportation experts and everyday New Yorkers.

The message: don’t drink and drive.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2023, Queens State Senator John Liu, representing District 16, publicly supported a bill in the State Legislature to lower the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for drivers from 0.08 to 0.05. The bill’s summary states, 'The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.' Liu, as the bill’s primary sponsor, emphasized that anyone found with a BAC over 0.05 would be charged with DWI. City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez joined the push, warning, 'Whether they are at 0.06 or 0.12 or 0.20, the consequences can be deadly.' Drunk driving caused 307 deaths in New York State in 2019, nearly a third of all fatal crashes. Utah’s adoption of a 0.05 BAC limit led to a 20% drop in fatal crashes in its first year. The bill is part of a broader effort to protect pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She opposes congestion pricing, speed cameras, and the expansion of bike lanes and open streets. Paladino supports speed bumps, raised crossings, and increased NYPD traffic enforcement. She calls for licensing, registration, and insurance for cyclists. Paladino also urges more investment in public transit and a full MTA audit.

Advocates like Alisa McMorris of Mothers Against Drunk Driving called for stronger messaging: 'We want people to make choices before they leave their home.'

Simon and Liu back the measure; city DOT and NYPD leaders joined them. DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' In 2021, 42 people died in drunk driving crashes, up 60 percent from previous years. Officials promise enforcement and education, but their messaging targets drinking, not the act of driving.
