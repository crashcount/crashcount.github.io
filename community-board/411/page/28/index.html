In the Senate, S 4045 would require repeat violators to install intelligent speed assistance. Senator <a href=/senate-district/16/>John Liu</a> co‑sponsored and voted yes in committee. Senator Toby Stavisky also voted yes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a></li></ul><p>At City Hall, a different bill would go the other way. Council Member Vickie Paladino introduced Int 1362‑2025 to erase protected bike and bus lane targets from the Streets Master Plan.
