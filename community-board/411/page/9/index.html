Mayor Adams stalls. Council Members Hudson and Joseph back the plan. Riders wait. Buses crawl. Working-class New Yorkers bear the brunt. The city delays. Streets stay dangerous. Justice deferred.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2024, a coalition of transit advocates and labor unions renewed calls for a Flatbush Avenue bus lane. The campaign, not tied to a specific council bill, has drawn support from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Rita Joseph. The matter, described as a 'no-brainer solution,' highlights slow bus speeds—often under 5 mph—and the urgent need for safer, faster transit. Jolyse Race of Riders Alliance stressed the economic justice at stake, noting bus riders earn half as much as car owners. Mayor Eric Adams has withheld support, citing community engagement and raising concerns about gentrification. The Department of Transportation's plans have stalled under his administration. Healthcare workers and union leaders spoke of missed shifts and unreliable service. Advocates now plan to survey bus riders to show support. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the campaign centers the needs of vulnerable bus riders and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan slashes insurance demands and trains new groups. Advocates say high costs and paperwork choke car-free events. The move could revive lost corridors and let more New Yorkers reclaim the road.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2024, Chief Public Realm Officer Ya-Ting Liu released a report proposing major reforms to New York City's open streets program. The plan, highlighted in the report 'Realm of Possibility,' aims to 'lift some of the bureaucratic and cost hurdles faced by the largely volunteer open streets groups.' Key elements include lowering or waiving liability insurance for small events, standardizing maintenance agreements, and launching a 'Public Space Academy' to train organizers. Jim Burke, organizer for 34th Avenue, called for removing barriers to make the program equitable. Gib Veconi of Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council and Jackson Chabot of Open Plans both praised the reforms, citing burdensome permit processes and high costs as threats to open streets. The proposal responds to advocates' warnings that city policies have stifled car-free spaces, risking the loss of vital corridors for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'

Valdivia warned, 'today it was announced, without MTA Board consultation, the cancellation of projects such as the Second Avenue Subway Phase II, our accessibility program... and a fully zero-emission bus fleet.' Joshi declared, 'It needs to happen now.' Garodnick cited a 'significant hole' in the MTA budget. Liu called congestion pricing 'the only policy' for transit and traffic. The New York City Independent Budget Office also warned of economic harm and delayed improvements.

Council Members Eric Dinowitz (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, and Robert F. Holden back the measure. They argue that capped fines are too low—companies absorb them, streets clog with trucks, and residents pay the price. The Council wants authority to set fines that actually deter illegal parking.
