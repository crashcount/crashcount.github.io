Twenty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Queens CB11 since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or habit. They only climb.</p><p>Just last month, a 74-year-old man was killed crossing at Northern Boulevard and 217th Street. The driver, behind the wheel of a 2017 SUV, was unlicensed. The man died at the intersection. There is no comfort in the details. There is only the fact of his absence. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On December 24th, a 56-year-old man was crushed and killed as a pedestrian on the Clearview Expressway. The crash was blamed on a driver following too closely, on a slippery road.

One was under 18. The streets do not forgive. SUVs and sedans do most of the damage—four deaths by cars, none by bikes. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, fathers, children.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>State Senator John Liu has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on bills to curb repeat speeders, requiring speed-limiting devices for those with a pattern of violations. He co-sponsored the bill, and he voted yes in committee. This is a step. But the deaths keep coming. Council Member Linda Lee, Assembly Member Ed Braunstein, and others have supported extending school speed zones. It is not enough.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez</a> as the city expanded car-free school streets. The city is moving, but not fast enough. The blood dries before the paint does.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders.

The narrative states, 'A 31-year-old man stood in the roadway. Two SUVs struck him, one after the other. His body broke beneath the steel. No intersection. No chance.' The crash occurred away from any intersection, with the pedestrian listed as 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Not at Intersection' and engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway.' The first SUV, a 2023 Nissan, was 'Changing Lanes' before its right front bumper struck the man. The second SUV, a 2018 Jaguar, was described as 'Parked' with impact to its center back end. The police report lists both driver contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The report does not attribute any contributing factors to the pedestrian's behavior. The sequence and violence of the impacts underscore the vulnerability of people on foot in high-speed corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The city adds more car-free zones for kids. Streets once deadly will now be safer for walking, play, and learning. The move targets neighborhoods hit hardest by crashes.</p><p class=mb3>On August 29, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a record 71 school streets will close to cars this fall. The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
