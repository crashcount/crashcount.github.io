In the Senate, S 4045 would require repeat violators to install intelligent speed assistance. Senator <a href=/senate-district/16/>John Liu</a> co‑sponsored and voted yes in committee. Senator Toby Stavisky also voted yes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a></li></ul><p>At City Hall, a different bill would go the other way. Council Member Vickie Paladino introduced Int 1362‑2025 to erase protected bike and bus lane targets from the Streets Master Plan.

If it works, Central Park could be next.</p><p class=mb3>On March 8, 2023, city officials announced a major redesign of Prospect Park’s East Drive. The project, not tied to a specific council bill, begins March 12 and is billed as an 18-month pilot. The main loop’s eastern stretch will be repaved and repainted, giving cyclists a 16-to-18-foot shared lane with authorized vehicles, flanked by two pedestrian lanes up to 14 feet wide. The city rejected a two-bike-lane alternative, citing pedestrian access needs. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie praised the upgrade, calling Prospect Park a treasure. Chief Public Realm Officer Ya-Ting Liu said, 'Re-examining how we design the roads in our park system is a perfect example of how we’re advancing the Mayor’s vision for quality public spaces throughout the city.' Officials stress the park is closed to private vehicles. The redesign aims to set a new standard for park safety and access across New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State lawmakers pushed back. Hochul wants the city to cover more. The fight over who funds transit leaves riders in limbo. No new money means service cuts or fare hikes loom.</p><p class=mb3>On February 16, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams traveled to Albany to oppose Governor Hochul’s proposal for New York City to contribute an extra $500 million annually to the MTA. Adams argued, “MTA is a statewide obligation. We’re doing our share.” State lawmakers, including Assembly Member Ed Braunstein and State Senator Liz Krueger, countered that the city should help. Hochul’s budget would shift more costs—like Access-A-Ride and student Metrocards—to the city. Progressive lawmakers suggested taxing the wealthy and freezing fares. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins warned, “To increase fares would be detrimental.” The debate continues as the legislature drafts its own budget. No direct safety analysis was provided, but funding gaps threaten transit service, putting vulnerable riders at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
