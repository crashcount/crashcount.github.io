One was a child. One was over 65. One was in the prime of life. Four more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In total, 643 people were hurt in 1,106 crashes in just twelve months. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><p>The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars. A 75-year-old woman was killed crossing 47th Avenue. The cause: driver inattention.

In the last three years, SUVs and cars took two lives and left dozens bleeding. Trucks and vans added to the toll. Bikes and mopeds did not kill anyone here, but they are not immune elsewhere. The street is a field of risk, and the largest machines win.</p><h3 id=the-response-words-laws-and-waiting>The Response: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>City Hall says the right things. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/13/senior-pedestrian-moped-rider-killed-in-separate-nyc-crashes-in-24-hours/>said Mayor Adams</a>.

The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not yet lowered. The law sits. The streets wait. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each delay is another risk. Each day of inaction is another family’s nightmare.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

Bottcher, Lincoln Restler, and others, amends the city code to require the Department of Transportation to report on vehicles with license plates unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems. The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The reports must be public and sent to the Mayor and Council Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s title: 'A Local Law in relation to parking for tractor trailers and other commercial trucks.' It requires the city to identify at least one feasible off-street parking location for tractor trailers in each borough by the end of 2023, and to establish those sites by December 31, 2025. No location can be on a residential street. Council Member Kamillah Hanks sponsored the bill, joined by Brannan, Riley, Dinowitz, Ung, Brooks-Powers, and others. The law aims to clear residential streets of oversized trucks, shifting their presence to designated lots. The council’s action targets the chronic hazard of trucks parked where people walk, bike, and live.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They argue the vans are vital for Asian communities. Without exemption, fares rise. Commutes get harder. The MTA has not taken a side.</p><p class=mb3>On September 24, 2023, Council Member Christopher Marte joined eight other elected officials in urging the MTA to exempt dollar vans from the upcoming congestion pricing plan. The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers. Assembly Member Grace Lee said, 'They should be exempt from tolls under the congestion pricing plan.' The MTA has not taken a position on the exemption.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
