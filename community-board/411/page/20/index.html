Twenty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Queens CB11 since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or habit. They only climb.</p><p>Just last month, a 74-year-old man was killed crossing at Northern Boulevard and 217th Street. The driver, behind the wheel of a 2017 SUV, was unlicensed. The man died at the intersection. There is no comfort in the details. There is only the fact of his absence. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On December 24th, a 56-year-old man was crushed and killed as a pedestrian on the Clearview Expressway. The crash was blamed on a driver following too closely, on a slippery road.

One was under 18. The streets do not forgive. SUVs and sedans do most of the damage—four deaths by cars, none by bikes. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, fathers, children.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>State Senator John Liu has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on bills to curb repeat speeders, requiring speed-limiting devices for those with a pattern of violations. He co-sponsored the bill, and he voted yes in committee. This is a step. But the deaths keep coming. Council Member Linda Lee, Assembly Member Ed Braunstein, and others have supported extending school speed zones. It is not enough.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez</a> as the city expanded car-free school streets. The city is moving, but not fast enough. The blood dries before the paint does.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders.

The bill passed both the state Senate and Assembly unanimously. The matter summary called for a study to extend the greenway, which runs parallel to the hazardous Union Turnpike. State Senator John Liu sponsored the bill and vowed to keep pushing for the project, saying, 'I’m confident we’ll get there.' Hochul’s veto cited budget concerns and the risk of 'duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy.' Advocates like Joby Jacob called the veto a blow to years of organizing, noting that people are forced to walk dirt paths where sidewalks should be. The veto blocks progress on a safer route for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled "City Traffic Helps Make Bus Service Unbearable, Expensive And Difficult To Improve," highlights how traffic congestion, double-parking, and outdated routes cripple bus efficiency. State Sen. John Liu urges more service in neighborhoods where buses can move. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says, "With better service, the path to more service is a much clearer one." ABLE cameras have improved bus speeds by 5 percent on enforced routes. Despite promises, Mayor Eric Adams has not delivered on expanding bus lanes. The MTA and advocates call for more funding and better service.

They argue the vans are vital for Asian communities. Without exemption, fares rise. Commutes get harder. The MTA has not taken a side.</p><p class=mb3>On September 24, 2023, Council Member Christopher Marte joined eight other elected officials in urging the MTA to exempt dollar vans from the upcoming congestion pricing plan. The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers. Assembly Member Grace Lee said, 'They should be exempt from tolls under the congestion pricing plan.' The MTA has not taken a position on the exemption.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
