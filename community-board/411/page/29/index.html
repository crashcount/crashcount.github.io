Police said the passenger ran from the scene. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/queens/driver-killed-passenger-flees-scene-after-queens-highway-crash>Patch</a> and city crash records mark the time and place. The city’s data logs unsafe speed in the fatal file. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>They were one of <strong>12 people killed</strong> in crashes in Queens CB11 since 2022, with 2,289 injured in 4,163 crashes. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-does-not-let-up>The pattern does not let up</h3><p>This year through Aug 31, crashes rose to <strong>951</strong>, up <strong>29.4%</strong> from 735 at this point last year. Reported injuries climbed from 467 to <strong>527</strong>. Deaths went from 0 to <strong>3</strong>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Deaths hit at all hours. The log shows lives lost at 2 AM, 3 AM, 5 AM—and again in the evening and night. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=highways-cut-through-people-pay>Highways cut through; people pay</h3><p>The deadliest spots here are the highways that slice the district. The Cross Island Parkway leads the list, with the Long Island Expressway and the Clearview Expressway close behind. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>One crash file says it plain: a left turn SUV struck a person on Northern Boulevard at 217th Street on Jun 11, 2025. A 74-year-old pedestrian died. The driver was unlicensed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On Jul 31, 2025, a 55-year-old woman on an e‑bike was killed at Hollis Court Boulevard and 50th Avenue.

We need a default 20 MPH and traffic‑calming to match. See our call to action <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</li><li>Albany can force the worst speeders to slow down. In the Senate, S 4045 would require repeat violators to install intelligent speed assistance. Senator <a href=/senate-district/16/>John Liu</a> co‑sponsored and voted yes in committee. Senator Toby Stavisky also voted yes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a></li></ul><p>At City Hall, a different bill would go the other way. Council Member Vickie Paladino introduced Int 1362‑2025 to erase protected bike and bus lane targets from the Streets Master Plan. As the official summary says, “<strong>This bill would remove the bus lane and bike lane quotas from the Streets Master Plan.</strong>” <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a></p><p>Queens CB11 is represented by Council Member <a href=/council-district/23/>Linda Lee</a>, Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/26/>Ed Braunstein</a>, and Senator <a href=/senate-district/16/>John Liu</a>. Braunstein backed the school‑zone speed camera extension this June.

Turning SUVs killed and injured people there. Hollis Court and 50th Avenue need a protected bike crossing and leading pedestrian/bike intervals. Along the Cross Island Parkway ramps, slow entries and better crossings can keep people alive.</p><p>The BMW on the Cross Island. The e‑bike on Hollis Court. The man at Northern. The list grows. The fixes wait.</p><p>Act now. Tell your lawmakers to slow the cars and stop the repeat speeders.
