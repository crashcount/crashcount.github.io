One was a child. One was over 65. One was in the prime of life. Four more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In total, 643 people were hurt in 1,106 crashes in just twelve months. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><p>The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars. A 75-year-old woman was killed crossing 47th Avenue. The cause: driver inattention.

The street is a field of risk, and the largest machines win.</p><h3 id=the-response-words-laws-and-waiting>The Response: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>City Hall says the right things. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/13/senior-pedestrian-moped-rider-killed-in-separate-nyc-crashes-in-24-hours/>said Mayor Adams</a>.

The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not yet lowered. The law sits. The streets wait. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each delay is another risk.

The matter, titled "Masters of Deflection: Congestion Pricing Foes Stoke Fear of Subway Crime," highlights how some council members and political groups use concerns about subway crime to oppose congestion pricing. Councilwoman Vickie Paladino voiced strong opposition, while advocates like Sara Lind and Ben Furnas countered that such arguments ignore real solutions and endanger transit funding. The article notes, 'Data shows the subway is statistically safer than city streets for both pedestrians and drivers.' Despite visible homelessness and high-profile crimes, most riders continue to use the subway. The debate exposes how fear is weaponized to block policies that could reduce traffic violence and improve safety for vulnerable road users.

The incident occurred off the roadway, with the pedestrian described as 'not in roadway' and 'not at intersection.' The police report states, 'Two flatbeds passed. One did not see. The right front bumper struck his head.' The victim suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The primary contributing factor cited in the police report is 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' No driver errors beyond inattention are listed. The report does not cite any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the truck driver's failure to notice the man lying off the road, resulting in a fatal collision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The analysis, covered by Streetsblog NYC, finds that open streets—car-free corridors—have about half the vacant storefronts of car-filled streets. The report states: 'vibrant public spaces are key to the success of local businesses.' City officials like Ya-Ting Liu, chief public realm officer, and volunteers such as Alex Morano and Brent Bovenzi, praised the program's impact. Bovenzi noted, 'the program is shrinking because too much of the burden falls upon volunteer labor.' The Open Streets program, now permanent, covers over 130 locations but relies heavily on volunteers. Advocates urge the city to invest more, as the data shows people-centric design drives economic recovery and safer, more vibrant neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
