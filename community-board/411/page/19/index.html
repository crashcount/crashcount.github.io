In the Senate, S 4045 would require repeat violators to install intelligent speed assistance. Senator <a href=/senate-district/16/>John Liu</a> co‑sponsored and voted yes in committee. Senator Toby Stavisky also voted yes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a></li></ul><p>At City Hall, a different bill would go the other way. Council Member Vickie Paladino introduced Int 1362‑2025 to erase protected bike and bus lane targets from the Streets Master Plan.

The bill passed both the state Senate and Assembly unanimously. The matter summary called for a study to extend the greenway, which runs parallel to the hazardous Union Turnpike. State Senator John Liu sponsored the bill and vowed to keep pushing for the project, saying, 'I’m confident we’ll get there.' Hochul’s veto cited budget concerns and the risk of 'duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy.' Advocates like Joby Jacob called the veto a blow to years of organizing, noting that people are forced to walk dirt paths where sidewalks should be.

The article, titled "City Traffic Helps Make Bus Service Unbearable, Expensive And Difficult To Improve," highlights how traffic congestion, double-parking, and outdated routes cripple bus efficiency. State Sen. John Liu urges more service in neighborhoods where buses can move. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says, "With better service, the path to more service is a much clearer one." ABLE cameras have improved bus speeds by 5 percent on enforced routes. Despite promises, Mayor Eric Adams has not delivered on expanding bus lanes. The MTA and advocates call for more funding and better service.
