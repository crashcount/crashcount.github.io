One was a child. One was over 65. One was in the prime of life. Four more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In total, 643 people were hurt in 1,106 crashes in just twelve months. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><p>The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars. A 75-year-old woman was killed crossing 47th Avenue. The cause: driver inattention.

In the last three years, SUVs and cars took two lives and left dozens bleeding. Trucks and vans added to the toll. Bikes and mopeds did not kill anyone here, but they are not immune elsewhere. The street is a field of risk, and the largest machines win.</p><h3 id=the-response-words-laws-and-waiting>The Response: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>City Hall says the right things. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/13/senior-pedestrian-moped-rider-killed-in-separate-nyc-crashes-in-24-hours/>said Mayor Adams</a>.

The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not yet lowered. The law sits. The streets wait. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each delay is another risk. Each day of inaction is another family’s nightmare.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

Prosecutors said Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and struck Justin Diaz, 23, who had the right-of-way. Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly double the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The article states, 'Pena was driving nearly 60 mph above the speed limit after a night of drinking at a bar.' Surveillance footage confirmed the sequence.

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license. The case highlights the lethal risk of unlicensed driving and the dangers of stopped vehicles on high-speed roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
