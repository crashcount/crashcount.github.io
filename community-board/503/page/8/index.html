A sedan hit him. He died where he fell. A 29-year-old driver, unlicensed, lost control on Drumgoole Road West. He was ejected and killed. A 69-year-old man died behind the wheel on Joline Avenue. A 33-year-old motorcyclist lost his life on the West Shore Expressway. These are not numbers. These are lives ended in the span of a year and a half. <strong>In the last 12 months, two people died and four suffered serious injuries on Staten Island CB3 streets.</strong> Children were not spared—68 injured, one seriously, in the past year alone. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data shows the toll</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-of-harm>The Pattern of Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed, maimed, and scarred. Sedans, SUVs, and trucks caused the bulk of pedestrian injuries and deaths. No one is immune. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home. The numbers do not lie: 13 dead, 14 seriously hurt, 1,349 injured since 2022. The carnage is steady, unbroken.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Words, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. But the pace is slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed in Albany, giving the city power to lower speed limits.</strong> The city can act now. It has not. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in doubt. When the law lapses, the cameras go dark. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise. When those sworn to protect drive drunk and crash, the truth is plain. &ldquo;I was driving. I was coming from the holiday party, I had three or four drinks. My life is over,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/16/nypd-officer-charged-with-dwi-three-placed-on-desk-duty-following-crash-after-staten-island-precinct-holiday-party/>admitted NYPD Officer Diana Todaro</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the road.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand action, not words. The dead cannot speak. You must. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Thousands of jobs vanish. Local companies lose out. Lawmakers in affected districts stay silent or cheer. Trains and buses face deep cuts. Riders, workers, and streets pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, Governor Hochul’s official pause on congestion pricing triggered a $12 billion loss in MTA contracts, according to a Reinvent Albany report. The move slashes funding for the 2020-24 MTA capital plan, which was to be partly paid by congestion pricing. The report highlights that many companies losing contracts are in districts represented by lawmakers who either support the pause or have stayed silent. Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick called congestion pricing 'simply another tax' and demanded repeal. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow praised the pause, saying it allows time to address 'communities' concerns.' Frank Russo, president of Ozone Park Lumber, warned, 'You can't just say, 'We're not going to buy supplies and equipment.'' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany said, 'Congestion pricing is an economic booster.' The pause means less money for transit, fewer jobs, and more risk for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, reliable public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
