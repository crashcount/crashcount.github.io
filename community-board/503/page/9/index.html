A sedan hit him. He died where he fell. A 29-year-old driver, unlicensed, lost control on Drumgoole Road West. He was ejected and killed. A 69-year-old man died behind the wheel on Joline Avenue. A 33-year-old motorcyclist lost his life on the West Shore Expressway. These are not numbers. These are lives ended in the span of a year and a half. <strong>In the last 12 months, two people died and four suffered serious injuries on Staten Island CB3 streets.</strong> Children were not spared—68 injured, one seriously, in the past year alone. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data shows the toll</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-of-harm>The Pattern of Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed, maimed, and scarred. Sedans, SUVs, and trucks caused the bulk of pedestrian injuries and deaths. No one is immune. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home. The numbers do not lie: 13 dead, 14 seriously hurt, 1,349 injured since 2022. The carnage is steady, unbroken.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Words, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. But the pace is slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed in Albany, giving the city power to lower speed limits.</strong> The city can act now. It has not. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in doubt. When the law lapses, the cameras go dark. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise. When those sworn to protect drive drunk and crash, the truth is plain. &ldquo;I was driving. I was coming from the holiday party, I had three or four drinks. My life is over,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/16/nypd-officer-charged-with-dwi-three-placed-on-desk-duty-following-crash-after-staten-island-precinct-holiday-party/>admitted NYPD Officer Diana Todaro</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the road.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand action, not words. The dead cannot speak. You must. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash ejected two 15-year-old boys from the scooter, leaving them with contusions to their knees, lower legs, and feet. The report lists "Traffic Control Disregarded" as a contributing factor, highlighting a driver’s failure to obey signals or signs. Both vehicles sustained front-end damage. The scooter driver was unlicensed, but the report centers the crash on the disregard for traffic control. The teens were conscious but hurt. The system’s safeguards broke down at the intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash involved animal action, contributing to the collision and injury severity.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 2021 Hyundai sedan traveling west on Drumgoole Road West struck two parked sedans—a 2020 Toyota and an Audi—both also facing west. The point of impact was the right front bumper of the moving sedan against the left rear and center back end of the parked vehicles. The report cites "Animals Action" as a contributing factor to the crash. A 29-year-old male occupant in the right rear passenger seat sustained head abrasions and was injured but not ejected. The sedan’s airbags deployed, and the passenger was restrained with a lap belt and harness. No driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding are listed, but the involvement of animal action indicates an external hazard precipitated the collision. The report does not attribute any contributing factors to the injured passenger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
