Lanza (District 24), seeks to repeal congestion pricing. The bill, introduced on February 11, 2025, is at the sponsorship stage. The measure’s title is blunt: 'Repeals congestion pricing.' Lanza’s move would scrap a system designed to cut car traffic and crashes. No safety analyst has weighed in, but repealing congestion pricing means more cars, more risk, and more danger for people on foot and bike. The bill’s progress threatens hard-won protections for New York’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lawmakers, joined by Senators Steven Rhoads and Bill Weber, criticized Lieber for 'losing the trust of commuters' and downplaying subway crime. They condemned the new $9 congestion pricing toll for Midtown, with Weber calling it 'tone deaf' and demanding repeal. The event summary reads: 'GOP pols push MTA boss to resign after brushing off transit crime as New York braces for even more taxes, fees.' The lawmakers oppose further taxes and fees to close the MTA’s $33 billion gap. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.
