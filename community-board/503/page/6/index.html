A sedan hit him. He died where he fell. A 29-year-old driver, unlicensed, lost control on Drumgoole Road West. He was ejected and killed. A 69-year-old man died behind the wheel on Joline Avenue. A 33-year-old motorcyclist lost his life on the West Shore Expressway. These are not numbers. These are lives ended in the span of a year and a half. <strong>In the last 12 months, two people died and four suffered serious injuries on Staten Island CB3 streets.</strong> Children were not spared—68 injured, one seriously, in the past year alone. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data shows the toll</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-of-harm>The Pattern of Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed, maimed, and scarred. Sedans, SUVs, and trucks caused the bulk of pedestrian injuries and deaths. No one is immune. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home. The numbers do not lie: 13 dead, 14 seriously hurt, 1,349 injured since 2022. The carnage is steady, unbroken.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Words, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. But the pace is slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed in Albany, giving the city power to lower speed limits.</strong> The city can act now. It has not. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in doubt. When the law lapses, the cameras go dark. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise. When those sworn to protect drive drunk and crash, the truth is plain. &ldquo;I was driving. I was coming from the holiday party, I had three or four drinks. My life is over,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/16/nypd-officer-charged-with-dwi-three-placed-on-desk-duty-following-crash-after-staten-island-precinct-holiday-party/>admitted NYPD Officer Diana Todaro</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the road.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand action, not words. The dead cannot speak. You must. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push.
