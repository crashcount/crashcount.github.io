A sedan hit him. He died where he fell. A 29-year-old driver, unlicensed, lost control on Drumgoole Road West. He was ejected and killed. A 69-year-old man died behind the wheel on Joline Avenue. A 33-year-old motorcyclist lost his life on the West Shore Expressway. These are not numbers. These are lives ended in the span of a year and a half. <strong>In the last 12 months, two people died and four suffered serious injuries on Staten Island CB3 streets.</strong> Children were not spared—68 injured, one seriously, in the past year alone. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data shows the toll</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-of-harm>The Pattern of Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed, maimed, and scarred. Sedans, SUVs, and trucks caused the bulk of pedestrian injuries and deaths. No one is immune. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home. The numbers do not lie: 13 dead, 14 seriously hurt, 1,349 injured since 2022. The carnage is steady, unbroken.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Words, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. But the pace is slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed in Albany, giving the city power to lower speed limits.</strong> The city can act now. It has not. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in doubt. When the law lapses, the cameras go dark. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise. When those sworn to protect drive drunk and crash, the truth is plain. &ldquo;I was driving. I was coming from the holiday party, I had three or four drinks. My life is over,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/16/nypd-officer-charged-with-dwi-three-placed-on-desk-duty-following-crash-after-staten-island-precinct-holiday-party/>admitted NYPD Officer Diana Todaro</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the road.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand action, not words. The dead cannot speak. You must. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

We believe that under these circumstances it is very warranted."" -- Andrew Lanza</p><p class=mb3>On January 8, 2025, Republican state legislators, including Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick (District 9), held a press conference demanding the resignation of Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair Janno Lieber. The lawmakers, joined by Senators Steven Rhoads and Bill Weber, criticized Lieber for 'losing the trust of commuters' and downplaying subway crime. They condemned the new $9 congestion pricing toll for Midtown, with Weber calling it 'tone deaf' and demanding repeal. The event summary reads: 'GOP pols push MTA boss to resign after brushing off transit crime as New York braces for even more taxes, fees.' The lawmakers oppose further taxes and fees to close the MTA’s $33 billion gap. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The debate leaves the city’s most exposed—pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders—uncertain and unprotected.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the man stepped into the street outside the crosswalk and was struck head-on by a southbound Buick sedan with Florida plates. The report states he died at the scene, his body broken as darkness fell. Police explicitly list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash, placing responsibility on the driver’s failure to notice the pedestrian. The vehicle’s point of impact was the center front end, confirming a direct collision. The report notes the pedestrian was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' but only after citing driver inattention. No additional victim behaviors are listed as contributing factors. The fatal crash underscores the deadly consequences of driver distraction on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
