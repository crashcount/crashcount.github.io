Assembly Members Michael Tannousis (primary), Mike Reilly, Samuel Pirozzolo, Michael Novakhov, Lester Chang, and Alec Brook-Krasny sponsor the bill.

The bill, introduced February 16, 2024, is in committee. It states: 'Permits a violation captured by a speed camera to be dismissed upon the application of the person alleged to be liable for such violation if any information that is required to be inserted in the notice of liability is omitted from such notice of liability, misdescribed or illegible.' No votes have been recorded. The bill focuses on procedural fairness for drivers, not on the safety of people outside the car.
