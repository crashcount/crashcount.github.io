The point of impact was the left rear quarter panel of one SUV, which was parked before the crash. No other driver errors or victim behaviors were noted. The focus remains on the hazardous lane markings that contributed to this serious injury crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, heard by city officials, centered on whether companies serving students with disabilities should avoid fines for running engines. Benedetto argued, "I believe DJ Ambulette should be ... given a variance to let them have their buses idle to properly maintain their temperature on their buses." DJ Transportation, a campaign donor, owes over $65,000 in unpaid fines and has not committed to electrifying its fleet. Benedetto denied any influence from donations. The Department of Environmental Protection and advocates rejected claims that idling is needed for temperature control, citing community health risks. Critics condemned the use of disabled clients as justification for continued pollution.

Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato.

The 20-year-old male driver crawled out conscious but with severe lacerations to his arm. The report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as the primary contributing factor for both vehicles. No driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding are mentioned. The narrative states, 'Pedestrian confusion sparked it,' without further detail on pedestrian actions. Both vehicles were going straight ahead before impact. The focus remains on the violent consequences of the crash and the systemic dangers, with no victim behavior cited beyond the pedestrian confusion noted by police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
