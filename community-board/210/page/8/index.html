The measure, discussed in the article 'NYC residents slapped with congestion pricing ‘surcharge’ by fed-up companies paying new toll: ‘Hochul inflation’,' has sparked backlash. Queens Councilman Robert F. Holden, representing District 30, condemned the move, stating, 'It’s no surprise that businesses will pass the Congestion Scam Tax on to consumers.' Companies like CompuVoip and Dream Events & Decor now add surcharges for customers in the zone. Holden’s criticism joins that of Bronx Councilwoman Kristy Marmorato and others, who warn of higher costs and increased gridlock. Emergency unions claim response times will suffer.

The toll stirs anger, hope, and a fight over who pays and who breathes.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2025, congestion pricing (no bill number cited) will begin in Manhattan after a federal judge allowed the toll to proceed. The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, set to fund $15 billion in subway and rail improvements, drew fierce opposition from unions and Councilwoman Kristy Marmorato, who called it a 'cash grab' that would 'increase all costs in our daily lives.' The union for FDNY EMTs argued the toll would burden low-wage workers, but data shows 90% of commuters already use public transit. City officials, including mayoral spokesperson Liz Garcia, insisted emergency response would not suffer. The measure's summary notes that reducing car traffic will speed up emergency vehicles and protect passengers. The uproar highlights the tension between entrenched driving privileges and the urgent need to make streets safer for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
