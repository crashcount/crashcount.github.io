The number of the wounded is higher—<strong>1,510 injured in 2,621 crashes</strong>. Each number is a life changed. Each crash is a story that ends in blood or fear.</p><p>Just days ago, a 71-year-old woman died in Co-op City. A 79-year-old driver hit two cars and a pole. Seven others were hurt. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. The street was quiet after. The cause is still under investigation. No arrests. No answers. Only loss.</p><h2 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm.</strong> They killed three people and left 137 with minor injuries, 47 with moderate, and six with serious wounds. Trucks and buses killed one, injured 13 more. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt seven. Bikes, two. The dead do not care what hit them. The living remember.</p><h2 id=local-leaders-steps-forward-steps-back>Local Leaders: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Some leaders act. State Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, forcing repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech. Assembly Member Michael Benedetto voted to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a>, keeping cameras near schools. These are steps, not solutions.</p><p>But Council Member Kristy Marmorato has fought to keep parking mandates and called congestion pricing a &ldquo;cash grab.&rdquo; She stands with drivers, not the dead. The streets stay wide for cars, narrow for children.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-action-not-excuses>The Call: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash that kills or maims could be stopped. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the end of parking mandates that choke the streets with cars. Demand that repeat speeders lose their right to endanger your family. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be carved into stone.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
