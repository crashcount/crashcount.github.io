Blood on the pavement, sirens in the morning. In the last twelve months, one person died and 466 were injured in crashes across Bronx CB10. Five of those injuries were severe. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope.</p><p>Pedestrians and bystanders pay the price. In April, a 32-year-old baggage handler tried to stop a thief from stealing his car. The thief sped off, dragging the man until his body hit the street. He lost his leg. He may never walk again. &ldquo;This has absolutely happened before,&rdquo; a neighbor told the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/26/bronx-carjacking-victim-leg-amputated-dragged-half-mile/>Daily News</a>. The Bronx bleeds, and the city shrugs.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p>The violence is not random. SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In the last three years, SUVs killed two pedestrians and seriously injured six more. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and bikes caused no deaths here, but the threat is always present. The faces change, the pain repeats.</p><p>The Bronx saw a 4% rise in car thefts this year, even as the rest of the city improved. The NYPD called the borough &ldquo;the absolute best place&rdquo; to steal a car, blaming a soft touch from prosecutors. The DA’s office pushed back: &ldquo;There is a difference between what the police charge at arrest and what we can prove in court&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/24/us-news/man-dragged-along-bronx-street-trying-to-stop-car-thief-video/>New York Post</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speeds, and more cameras. But the carnage continues. The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The clock ticks. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next? Demand More</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every delay is a choice. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets where a man can walk home without fear. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The collision occurred as the taxi was traveling straight ahead and hit the pedestrian head-on, causing severe bleeding from her head. The report notes the cab’s front end was crumpled and its tinted windows obscured the driver’s face. According to the police report, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and 'Tinted Windows' were listed as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal and was not at an intersection, as documented in the report, but the presence of tinted windows is also cited as a factor. The focus remains on the driver’s visibility and the systemic risks posed by vehicle design and street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
