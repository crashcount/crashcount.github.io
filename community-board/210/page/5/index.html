Same ending.</p><p>On the Bronx River Parkway before dawn, a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass a Volkswagen. He hit it, then struck two bikes. Both riders were thrown and died. Police charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, then released him without bail as the case moved forward, according to multiple reports. The families asked why he walked free. “Two people were killed. He was drunk,” a sister said. The defense said, “My client is prepared to contest these charges.” These are the words left behind. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>, <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>amNY</a>, and the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Daily News</a> reported the crash and charges.</p><p>In this community board, four pedestrians have been killed since 2022. Two more people died as car occupants. The pain is spread across parkways and local streets. The numbers are dry. The pavement is not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Bruckner. Hutch. Tremont. Names you know.</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><p>Crashes pile up where speed rules. The worst hot spots here are the <a href=#>Bruckner Expressway</a> and the <a href=#>Hutchinson River Parkway</a>. Together they show repeated death and injury since 2022. East Tremont Avenue adds dozens more injuries. Parkways close. Families wait. The road reopens. The risk stays. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Small‑area analysis</a></p><p>Injuries spike late. From 8 p.m. to after midnight, the hurt keeps coming, with deaths at 20:00 and 23:00 hours. Morning isn’t safe either: 8, 10, and 11 a.m. all show deaths. Violence does not keep hours. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Small‑area analysis</a></p><p>The bodies are mostly people outside cars. Since 2022 here: pedestrians, four dead and 236 hurt; cyclists, 66 hurt. Heavy vehicles hit hard. Trucks and buses are tied to two pedestrian deaths; SUVs to two more. A left‑turning pickup killed a woman at Seddon and St. Raymond. A distracted SUV driver killed a man on Westchester Avenue at 4:37 a.m. These are not accidents. They are impacts. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The pattern doesn’t blink.</p><p>Crashes in this board jumped 48% year‑over‑year through late July. Injuries jumped 47%. Deaths in the year‑to‑date slice read zero, but the full period tells the truth: seven killed since 2022, including four people on foot. The afternoon peak cuts, too: 4 p.m. brings the most injuries. Pain at breakfast, lunch, and midnight. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Period stats</a></p><p>Causes repeat like bad habits. Failure to yield and distraction show up again and again. “Other” factors blanket hundreds of injuries. “Unsafe speed” appears, small on paper, large on asphalt. You feel it on Tremont. You feel it on the Bruckner. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Small‑area analysis</a></p><p>Three steps. Fewer funerals.</p><ul><li>Daylight every turn on East Tremont and around Co‑op City. Harden the corners. Give people the walk first with leading intervals. Trucks should not be able to swing wide into a crowd.</li><li>Target trucks and SUVs at the board’s repeat hot spots in the late‑night hours when deaths rise. Enforce failure‑to‑yield and speeding where the injuries pile up.</li><li>Fix the parkway exits where local streets meet highway speed. Slow the ramps. Mark crossings that drivers cannot ignore.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany renewed 24‑hour speed cameras near schools through 2030. Your Assembly Member and Senator voted yes. The tools exist. Use them where people keep getting hurt. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Senate vote</a></p><p>The Senate also advanced a bill to force the worst repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Senator Fernández voted yes in committee. Point the device at the small share of drivers who do the most harm. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a></p><p>City Hall now has the power to lower speeds. A citywide 20 mph default would save lives. The city has not done it yet. Don’t wait for the next ambulance. <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Progress on bike lanes, bus lanes, and signals must go public. No more hiding delays or cost overruns. The city must show its work.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 1105-2024, now enacted, came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced November 13, 2024, it passed Council on April 10, 2025, and became law May 10, 2025. The bill's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...in relation to tracking progress made towards the requirements of the streets master plan.' Council Member Julie Won led sponsorship, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Ayala, and others. The law demands DOT post annual and monthly updates on every project tied to the master plan—listing details, timelines, funding, and setbacks. This law brings sunlight to street safety work, making the city answer for every mile and missed deadline.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
