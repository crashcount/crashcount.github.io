Introduced February 28, 2024, it calls for an advisory board on school crossing guard deployment. The board would include the NYPD, Department of Transportation, and Department of Education. According to the bill summary: 'Such advisory board would be responsible for submitting biannual reports, relating to recommended deployment of school crossing guards, to the Mayor, the City Council Speaker and the Police Commissioner.' Council Member Kamillah Hanks leads as primary sponsor, joined by Stevens, Schulman, Salaam, Won, Cabán, Riley, Farías, Restler, Williams, Narcisse, Banks, Louis, Brooks-Powers, Marmorato, and the Bronx Borough President. The bill demands city agencies work together, but it does not guarantee more guards or safer crossings. The danger for children at city intersections remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Four new Metro-North stations promise faster, safer commutes. Councilmembers Marmorato and Farias back the plan. The public weighs in. The city moves closer to breaking car dependence in transit deserts.</p><p class=mb3>On January 5, 2024, the City Council held a public input session on the plan to open four new Metro-North stations in East Bronx. The proposal, nearing the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) certification, aims to serve Co-op City, Morris Park, Parkchester/Van Nest, and Hunts Point. The session, supported by Councilmember Kristy Marmorato (District 13) and Councilmember Amanda Farias, highlighted the need for faster, more reliable transit. Marmorato said, 'the Metro-North will provide an alternative for drivers dealing with congestion pricing, and for those who might be reluctant to take the subway.' Farias called it part of a 'better transit future.' The Department of City Planning updated residents, reflecting ongoing community feedback. The plan has bipartisan support and promises to reshape transit for neighborhoods long underserved by safe, fast options.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
