Since 2022, six people have died in crashes. Twenty-seven more suffered serious injuries. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the asphalt, families left with empty chairs. In the last twelve months alone, one person died and six were seriously hurt. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just days ago, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a light pole in Co-op City. His 71-year-old passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died at Jacobi Medical Center. Seven others were hurt. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. The street was quiet except for the sirens.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and trucks did the most harm. Since 2022, they killed three people and injured 197 more. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt seven. Bikes injured two. The weight of steel does not care who is in its path. The old, the young, the careful, the distracted—all are at risk.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-work-left-undone>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Work Left Undone</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. State Senator Nathalia Fernández <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to require speed-limiting devices</a> for repeat speeders, a move meant to stop the worst offenders. Assembly Member Michael Benedetto voted to extend school speed zones, protecting children at the curb. But Council Member Kristy Marmorato has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/07/bronx-metro-north-rezoning-parking-mandates>fought to keep parking mandates and called congestion pricing a &ldquo;cash grab&rdquo;</a>, putting drivers first and leaving the rest exposed.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The cost is measured in blood.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a policy choice. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The committee rejected the Adams administration's push to eliminate parking requirements, instead voting to retain mandates and lower building heights. Marmorato argued, "We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities," and prioritized drivers over reducing car dependency. The proposal, part of the Mayor's 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' plan, aimed to boost affordable housing and transit-oriented development. Marmorato's stance, echoed in multiple statements, keeps parking at the center and limits safer, walkable streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the move preserves car dominance and its dangers for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Despite no city parking mandates, car storage dominates debate. Transit access takes a back seat. Vulnerable road users face more cars, more risk.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2024, the City Council held a hearing on proposed rezonings around new Metro-North stations in the Bronx. The matter, titled 'Transit-Oriented Bronx Developments Will Have Ample Parking, Developers Tell Council,' focused on whether to require parking in new residential and commercial projects. Council Members Amanda Faris, Kevin C. Riley, Rafael Salamanca, and Kristy Marmorato all pressed for developers to include parking, despite the city's move to waive mandates. Riley called parking 'a huge issue.' Developers, including Baker Development, promised up to 200 spaces per project. Bronx City Planning Director Paul Philips said, 'We certainly expect developers to provide parking.' The debate ignored the danger more parking brings: more cars, more conflict, more risk for people walking and biking. No safety analyst weighed in, but the outcome is clear—transit-oriented in name, car-centric in practice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
