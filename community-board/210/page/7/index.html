Council Member Marmorato and Borough President Richards defend these rules, blocking safer, more vibrant neighborhoods. Ending mandates means more housing, cleaner air, and safer streets for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion, published September 3, 2024, in Streetsblog NYC, calls out Council Member Kristy Marmorato and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards for defending parking mandates. Richards opposes lifting mandates in Queens, citing poor transit. Marmorato lobbied to restore mandates in a Bronx rezoning near new Metro North stations, arguing, 'We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities.' The editorial rebukes this logic, stating, 'We should not cling to parking mandates when we know they encourage car ownership, make streets less vibrant, increase rents, and pollute our air.' The piece urges officials to break the cycle of car-first policy, invest in transit, and end mandates that block affordable housing and safer streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the editorial centers the harm parking mandates inflict on vulnerable road users and the city’s livability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Four cars hit him in sequence. He died there, body broken under headlights and steel. The road offered no signal, no pause, only relentless speed and impact.</p><p class=mb3>A 66-year-old pedestrian was killed on Hutchinson River Parkway after being struck by four vehicles in succession, according to the police report. The incident occurred at night, with the man crossing the dark roadway outside a crosswalk. The report states, 'Four cars struck him. One after another. Crush injuries. Whole body. No signal. No time. He died there, under headlights, beneath steel and speed.' All vehicles involved were traveling straight ahead, with points of impact listed as undercarriage, right front bumper, center front end, and left front quarter panel. Police data lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both the crash and the pedestrian, offering no further detail on driver actions. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The sequence of impacts and the lack of a crossing signal highlight the systemic danger faced by pedestrians on high-speed parkways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The point of impact was the taxi's left front bumper and the moped's center front end. The 21-year-old moped rider, unlicensed and not wearing a helmet, was ejected and sustained a severe head injury with significant bleeding. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors to the crash. The taxi driver was licensed and operating the vehicle during the turn. The moped rider's unlicensed status and lack of helmet are noted but secondary to the primary driver errors. This collision underscores the dangers posed by distracted driving and unsafe speeds, especially to vulnerable road users in the Bronx.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The committee rejected the Adams administration's push to eliminate parking requirements, instead voting to retain mandates and lower building heights. Marmorato argued, "We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities," and prioritized drivers over reducing car dependency. The proposal, part of the Mayor's 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' plan, aimed to boost affordable housing and transit-oriented development. Marmorato's stance, echoed in multiple statements, keeps parking at the center and limits safer, walkable streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the move preserves car dominance and its dangers for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Despite no city parking mandates, car storage dominates debate. Transit access takes a back seat. Vulnerable road users face more cars, more risk.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2024, the City Council held a hearing on proposed rezonings around new Metro-North stations in the Bronx. The matter, titled 'Transit-Oriented Bronx Developments Will Have Ample Parking, Developers Tell Council,' focused on whether to require parking in new residential and commercial projects. Council Members Amanda Faris, Kevin C. Riley, Rafael Salamanca, and Kristy Marmorato all pressed for developers to include parking, despite the city's move to waive mandates. Riley called parking 'a huge issue.' Developers, including Baker Development, promised up to 200 spaces per project. Bronx City Planning Director Paul Philips said, 'We certainly expect developers to provide parking.' The debate ignored the danger more parking brings: more cars, more conflict, more risk for people walking and biking. No safety analyst weighed in, but the outcome is clear—transit-oriented in name, car-centric in practice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
