The committee rejected the Adams administration's push to eliminate parking requirements, instead voting to retain mandates and lower building heights. Marmorato argued, "We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities," and prioritized drivers over reducing car dependency. The proposal, part of the Mayor's 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' plan, aimed to boost affordable housing and transit-oriented development. Marmorato's stance, echoed in multiple statements, keeps parking at the center and limits safer, walkable streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the move preserves car dominance and its dangers for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Despite no city parking mandates, car storage dominates debate. Transit access takes a back seat. Vulnerable road users face more cars, more risk.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2024, the City Council held a hearing on proposed rezonings around new Metro-North stations in the Bronx. The matter, titled 'Transit-Oriented Bronx Developments Will Have Ample Parking, Developers Tell Council,' focused on whether to require parking in new residential and commercial projects. Council Members Amanda Faris, Kevin C. Riley, Rafael Salamanca, and Kristy Marmorato all pressed for developers to include parking, despite the city's move to waive mandates. Riley called parking 'a huge issue.' Developers, including Baker Development, promised up to 200 spaces per project. Bronx City Planning Director Paul Philips said, 'We certainly expect developers to provide parking.' The debate ignored the danger more parking brings: more cars, more conflict, more risk for people walking and biking. No safety analyst weighed in, but the outcome is clear—transit-oriented in name, car-centric in practice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, heard by city officials, centered on whether companies serving students with disabilities should avoid fines for running engines. Benedetto argued, "I believe DJ Ambulette should be ... given a variance to let them have their buses idle to properly maintain their temperature on their buses." DJ Transportation, a campaign donor, owes over $65,000 in unpaid fines and has not committed to electrifying its fleet. Benedetto denied any influence from donations. The Department of Environmental Protection and advocates rejected claims that idling is needed for temperature control, citing community health risks. Critics condemned the use of disabled clients as justification for continued pollution.
