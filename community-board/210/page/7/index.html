Transit and vulnerable road users lose ground.</p><p class=mb3>On August 7, 2024, the City Council's Land Use Committee, led by Kristy Marmorato, amended a rezoning plan (no bill number provided) for areas near two new Metro-North stations. The committee rejected the Adams administration's push to eliminate parking requirements, instead voting to retain mandates and lower building heights. Marmorato argued, "We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities," and prioritized drivers over reducing car dependency. The proposal, part of the Mayor's 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' plan, aimed to boost affordable housing and transit-oriented development. Marmorato's stance, echoed in multiple statements, keeps parking at the center and limits safer, walkable streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the move preserves car dominance and its dangers for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report cites improper or inadequate lane markings as a contributing factor for both vehicles. Additionally, alcohol involvement was noted for the driver and front passenger of one SUV. All occupants, including the drivers and passengers, were injured with complaints of whiplash, abrasions, and injuries to the entire body or lower limbs. All occupants were restrained with lap belts and harnesses and none were ejected. The collision highlights systemic dangers related to lane marking deficiencies and impaired driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Despite no city parking mandates, car storage dominates debate. Transit access takes a back seat. Vulnerable road users face more cars, more risk.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2024, the City Council held a hearing on proposed rezonings around new Metro-North stations in the Bronx. The matter, titled 'Transit-Oriented Bronx Developments Will Have Ample Parking, Developers Tell Council,' focused on whether to require parking in new residential and commercial projects. Council Members Amanda Faris, Kevin C. Riley, Rafael Salamanca, and Kristy Marmorato all pressed for developers to include parking, despite the city's move to waive mandates. Riley called parking 'a huge issue.' Developers, including Baker Development, promised up to 200 spaces per project. Bronx City Planning Director Paul Philips said, 'We certainly expect developers to provide parking.' The debate ignored the danger more parking brings: more cars, more conflict, more risk for people walking and biking. No safety analyst weighed in, but the outcome is clear—transit-oriented in name, car-centric in practice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets may change.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill S 9718, titled "Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles," advanced through the Senate with committee votes on May 28 and June 3, 2024. The bill, sponsored by Sean Ryan (District 61) and co-sponsored by Liz Krueger, Monica Martinez, Jack M. Martins, Anthony H. Palumbo, and Julia Salazar, passed both votes despite opposition. The measure calls for redesigning streets to protect all users, not just drivers. The vote was not unanimous—several senators voted no, but the majority carried it through. The bill’s focus is clear: safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles. No safety analyst note was provided, but the intent is to cut danger at the curb and crosswalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Industry wins.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2024, Bronx Assembly Member Michael Benedetto testified in support of exempting DJ Transportation from New York City’s anti-idling law. The matter, heard by city officials, centered on whether companies serving students with disabilities should avoid fines for running engines. Benedetto argued, "I believe DJ Ambulette should be ... given a variance to let them have their buses idle to properly maintain their temperature on their buses." DJ Transportation, a campaign donor, owes over $65,000 in unpaid fines and has not committed to electrifying its fleet. Benedetto denied any influence from donations. The Department of Environmental Protection and advocates rejected claims that idling is needed for temperature control, citing community health risks. Critics condemned the use of disabled clients as justification for continued pollution. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision occurred as the taxi was traveling straight ahead and hit the pedestrian head-on, causing severe bleeding from her head. The report notes the cab’s front end was crumpled and its tinted windows obscured the driver’s face. According to the police report, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and 'Tinted Windows' were listed as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal and was not at an intersection, as documented in the report, but the presence of tinted windows is also cited as a factor. The focus remains on the driver’s visibility and the systemic risks posed by vehicle design and street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
