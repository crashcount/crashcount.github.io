Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way. The bill targets that risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The e-scooter rider was not ejected and remained conscious after the collision. The report also notes pedestrian/bicyclist confusion but emphasizes the aggressive driving behavior of the SUV driver.

Four new Metro-North stations promise faster, safer commutes. Councilmembers Marmorato and Farias back the plan. The public weighs in. The city moves closer to breaking car dependence in transit deserts.</p><p class=mb3>On January 5, 2024, the City Council held a public input session on the plan to open four new Metro-North stations in East Bronx. The proposal, nearing the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) certification, aims to serve Co-op City, Morris Park, Parkchester/Van Nest, and Hunts Point. The session, supported by Councilmember Kristy Marmorato (District 13) and Councilmember Amanda Farias, highlighted the need for faster, more reliable transit. Marmorato said, 'the Metro-North will provide an alternative for drivers dealing with congestion pricing, and for those who might be reluctant to take the subway.' Farias called it part of a 'better transit future.' The Department of City Planning updated residents, reflecting ongoing community feedback. The plan has bipartisan support and promises to reshape transit for neighborhoods long underserved by safe, fast options.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
