The state may build a connecting road across the Bronx River to keep traffic moving during bridge repairs. Critics, including environmental and transit groups, say this would widen the expressway, bringing more traffic and pollution. The officials' letter asks the state to 'fully consider' options without the new road. DOT spokesman Rolando Infante said no decision has been made. The $900 million project includes capping sections with parks and green space.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
