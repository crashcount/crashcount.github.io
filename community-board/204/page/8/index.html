An SUV turned into a driveway, struck her, and kept going. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. The driver vanished. Police are still searching. The news was blunt: <strong>&ldquo;A 44-year-old woman was fatally mowed down by a reckless driver&mldr; before zooming off&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/us-news/44-year-old-woman-killed-in-nyc-hit-and-run-by-reckless-driver-turning-into-driveway/>reported the New York Post</a>.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last 12 months, <strong>690 people were injured and 1 killed</strong> in traffic crashes in Bronx CB4. Four suffered serious injuries. Most were walking. Most never saw it coming.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>From 2022 to now, <strong>over 2,100 people have been hurt and 10 killed</strong> in this district. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The killers are cars, SUVs, trucks, and the drivers who flee. <strong>SUVs alone caused 3 deaths and 3 serious injuries to pedestrians</strong>. Sedans killed another. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families left waiting for someone who will not come home.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Local politicians have taken some steps. <strong>Senator Serrano <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on a bill to require speed limiters for repeat speeders</a></strong>. It is a start. But the streets do not wait for committee votes. The woman who died last week did not get a vote. The driver who killed her did not face a speed limiter.</p><p>The police say, <strong>&ldquo;Police are still searching for the runaway driver. No arrests have been made&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/us-news/44-year-old-woman-killed-in-nyc-hit-and-run-by-reckless-driver-turning-into-driveway/>according to the New York Post</a>.

This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, another family risks the knock at the door. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets that put people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Steel scraped concrete. Debris rained down. No one was hurt. The wall broke. The rules broke first.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on January 17, 2025, that a BxM1 MTA bus nearly plunged from the Henry Hudson Parkway overpass after the driver swerved to avoid an illegally double-parked car. The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
