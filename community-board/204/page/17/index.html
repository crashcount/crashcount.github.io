Prosecutors charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He refused a chemical test, according to the complaint. A sister stood outside court and said, “Two people were killed.

Daylight corners. Harden the turns. Give leading pedestrian intervals. Protect bike and moped space where riders are getting hit. Push truck routes off local streets at night.

Lower the default speed limit. Pair it with the speed‑limiter bill for repeat offenders. Keep the cameras on.
