Prosecutors charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He refused a chemical test, according to the complaint. A sister stood outside court and said, “Two people were killed.

Daylight corners. Harden the turns. Give leading pedestrian intervals. Protect bike and moped space where riders are getting hit. Push truck routes off local streets at night.

Lower the default speed limit. Pair it with the speed‑limiter bill for repeat offenders. Keep the cameras on.

The injured passenger was not using any safety equipment. The drivers of the vehicles were licensed, with the taxi driver being male and the others female. This collision highlights the risks posed by unsafe lane changes in fast-moving traffic, as documented by the police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
