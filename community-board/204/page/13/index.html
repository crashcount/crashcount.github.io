Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck two motorcycles. Both riders—Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21—died at the hospital. Prosecutors charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He refused a chemical test, according to the complaint. A sister stood outside court and said, “Two people were killed.

The worst hours are 1 a.m., 4–5 a.m., and 9 a.m., with deaths logged at those times. Injuries surge late evening too. The midnight hour alone shows 91 injuries and five serious injuries. This does not stop. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Heavy roads cut through this board. The Major Deegan, the Cross Bronx, Jerome, Webster.

Pedestrians bear it: 417 injured, four killed over the period. Bicyclists: 138 hurt. Riders on mopeds and the like: 66 hurt, one killed.

The Senate bill S 4045 would force repeat violators to install speed‑limiting tech. Local Senators Jose Serrano and Luis Sepúlveda voted yes in committee; both co‑sponsored. This targets drivers who rack up points or a string of camera tickets. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States: S 4045</a></p><p>Albany also extended 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030.

Daylight corners. Harden the turns. Give leading pedestrian intervals. Protect bike and moped space where riders are getting hit. Push truck routes off local streets at night. Target repeat hotspots after midnight. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Citywide steps belong here too. Lower the default speed limit. Pair it with the speed‑limiter bill for repeat offenders. Keep the cameras on.
