Over 2,100 have been hurt. Nineteen were left with injuries so grave they may never heal. In the last year alone, 677 people were injured and one was killed. Children are not spared—sixty-four under 18 were hurt in the past twelve months. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a driver in a Mustang mounted the sidewalk at East 149th and Courtlandt, plowing into six people.</strong> The driver ran. The victims went to Lincoln Hospital. Police called it a botched turn. The city called it minor injuries. But a body on the sidewalk is never minor. The Daily News <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>reported the search for the driver</a>.</p><p>Last fall, a woman ran over a man at a gas station, dragged him 950 feet, and left him dead in a bike lane. She looked under her car, saw him pinned, and drove away. Bronx DA Darcel Clark <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/23/bronx-hit-run-driver-arrested-2-years-after-dragging-pedestrian-950-feet-to-death-da/>called her actions egregious and inhumane</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-and-who-acts>Who Pays and Who Acts</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> Four deaths, 254 minor injuries, 96 moderate injuries, and five serious injuries came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses hurt 17. Motorcycles and mopeds, 17 more. Bikes, 14. The street does not care who you are. It only cares who is bigger.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-next-fight>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Next Fight</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Jose Serrano and Assembly Member Amanda Septimo both co-sponsored and voted for the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Do not wait for another body on the sidewalk. The street belongs to all of us. Make them prove it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
