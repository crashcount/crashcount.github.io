An SUV turned into a driveway, struck her, and kept going. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. The driver vanished. Police are still searching. The news was blunt: <strong>&ldquo;A 44-year-old woman was fatally mowed down by a reckless driver&mldr; before zooming off&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/us-news/44-year-old-woman-killed-in-nyc-hit-and-run-by-reckless-driver-turning-into-driveway/>reported the New York Post</a>.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last 12 months, <strong>690 people were injured and 1 killed</strong> in traffic crashes in Bronx CB4. Four suffered serious injuries. Most were walking. Most never saw it coming.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>From 2022 to now, <strong>over 2,100 people have been hurt and 10 killed</strong> in this district. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The killers are cars, SUVs, trucks, and the drivers who flee. <strong>SUVs alone caused 3 deaths and 3 serious injuries to pedestrians</strong>. Sedans killed another. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families left waiting for someone who will not come home.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Local politicians have taken some steps. <strong>Senator Serrano <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on a bill to require speed limiters for repeat speeders</a></strong>. It is a start. But the streets do not wait for committee votes. The woman who died last week did not get a vote. The driver who killed her did not face a speed limiter.</p><p>The police say, <strong>&ldquo;Police are still searching for the runaway driver. No arrests have been made&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/us-news/44-year-old-woman-killed-in-nyc-hit-and-run-by-reckless-driver-turning-into-driveway/>according to the New York Post</a>.

This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, another family risks the knock at the door. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets that put people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No safety analyst note is available, but the intent is clear—systemic change for vulnerable road users.
