The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to require every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter, and other legal motorized vehicle to be registered with the Department of Transportation and display a visible license plate. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.' Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections. The streets stayed dangerous. The cars kept their edge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
