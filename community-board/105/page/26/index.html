Nineteen seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in Manhattan CB5. The numbers do not flinch. They do not pause for breath. In this small patch of Manhattan, the street keeps taking.</p><p>Just last week, a 65-year-old man rode his e-bike down Second Avenue. A 21-year-old, driving a Nissan Rogue, hit him and fled. The man was left with severe head trauma. Paramedics found him unconscious and started CPR in the street. The driver was arrested two hours later, charged with leaving the scene and driving without a license.

Council Member Christopher Marte <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/manhattan-bridge-crash-driver-faces-murder-rap-marte-blasts-dot-for-neglect-KB4883851>called out the city’s neglect</a>: “It is time for the city to take action.”</p><h3 id=the-pattern-vulnerable-lives-repeat-offenders>The Pattern: Vulnerable Lives, Repeat Offenders</h3><p><strong>Most of the dead are not drivers.</strong> They are walkers, cyclists, elders. In the last year, three people over 65 were killed. Two more over 75. One was crossing with the signal. Another was on a bike. One was just sitting.</p><p>The killers are often repeat offenders. A small group of drivers rack up tickets and keep driving. The city has the power to stop them.

State Senator Liz Krueger <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to require speed-limiting devices for repeat speeders</a>. Assembly Member Tony Simone <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills to expand camera enforcement and hold vehicle owners liable</a>.</p><p>But the carnage continues. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst keep driving. The street stays hungry.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real penalties for repeat offenders. Demand streets that do not kill.

The bill would increase the penalty to $100 for a second offense within a year and require towing after three violations in 12 months. Assembly Member Tony Simone submitted a state bill to double fines after the tenth violation, up to five times the current cap. The matter targets 'the worst repeat offenders of parking tickets.' Manhattan safe streets activist Jehiah Czebotar analyzed city data, finding that 77 percent of street-sweeping tickets go to repeat offenders, with 37 percent to drivers who got at least six tickets. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired last year, leaving a gap in enforcement. Lawmakers say fines must deter, not just be a cost of doing business.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
