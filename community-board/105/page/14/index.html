Twenty-two seriously hurt.</strong> In the past year, Manhattan CB5 has seen 1,200 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. A 34-year-old man was killed crossing 7th Avenue and West 36th Street. The driver was distracted. The man is gone. The street is the same. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it. In the last twelve months, three people over 65 died. Two more over 75. One was crossing with the light. One was not in the road. The cars kept moving.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h2><p>City leaders talk about safety. They pass laws. They hold meetings. But the streets do not change fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany lets the law expire and then debates bringing it back. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p>On 34th Street, the city wants a busway. Some cheer. Some worry about cars clogging side streets. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to prioritize pedestrians and transit users, and not the minority of residents who use their personal cars to get around,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/34th-street-busway-proposal-gets-public-feedback-pro-con-DA4714360>said Charles Todd</a>. Others call for more studies. More waiting. &ldquo;He argued that even if cars largely &lsquo;disappear&rsquo; from 34th Street, they could then &lsquo;impact&rsquo; the surrounding neighborhood, rather than &lsquo;bus riders or bike riders.&rsquo; He called for a &rsquo;traffic study&rsquo; and an &lsquo;action plan.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/34th-street-busway-proposal-gets-public-feedback-pro-con-DA4714360>said Richard Hart</a>.</p><h2 id=the-blunt-edge-of-policy>The Blunt Edge of Policy</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars killed six. Trucks and buses killed two.</strong> Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but they did not kill. The city redesigns intersections. It adds bike lanes. Still, the deaths keep coming. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, the old, the young—pay the price for every delay, every watered-down law, every inch given back to traffic.</p><h2 id=act-no-more-waiting>Act: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets for people, not just for cars.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another name lost.
