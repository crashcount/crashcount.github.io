Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in Manhattan CB5. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Each body broken on the street is a life cut short, a family left waiting for a voice that will not answer.</p><p>Just this spring, a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>34-year-old man was killed crossing 7th Avenue</a>. The driver kept going straight. The pedestrian never got up. The cause: driver inattention. The city calls it a crash. The family calls it a loss that does not heal.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-break>Patterns That Do Not Break</h3><p><strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> In the last year, CB5 saw 1,504 crashes, 822 injuries, and 20 serious injuries. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. Three people over 65 killed. Two more over 75. No one is spared. Cars, SUVs, trucks, taxis—they all take their share. <strong>SUVs alone killed six pedestrians</strong> in this district since 2022. Buses and trucks add to the toll. The city’s data does not show mercy.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Some leaders have acted. Assembly Member Tony Simone <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored a bill</a> to expand speed camera enforcement. State Senator Liz Krueger <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. But the streets remain deadly. Council Member Keith Powers called for using idle congestion pricing cameras for enforcement, saying, &ldquo;[The state] certainly should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>nypost.com</a>).</p><p>Residents are not fooled by promises. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Nita</a>. The city’s pace is slow. The street does not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who delay, by systems that favor speed over safety. The dead cannot call for change. The living must do it for them.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets where a walk does not end in blood.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
