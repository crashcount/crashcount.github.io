A 30-year-old female pedestrian, not at an intersection, was left with contusions and bruises to her hip and leg. Two passengers, ages 24 and 27, sustained whiplash and head injuries. The report does not cite any pedestrian actions as factors. Systemic failures—faulty brakes, ignored signals—set the stage for harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Unsafe speed and defective pavement contributed to the crash.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 2005 Kawasaki motorcycle was traveling southbound on 5th Avenue near East 50th Street when it crashed due to 'Pavement Defective' conditions combined with 'Unsafe Speed.' The motorcycle had two occupants: a 22-year-old male driver and a 17-year-old female passenger. Both were wearing helmets, as noted under 'safety equipment,' but sustained injuries including abrasions and trauma to the knee, lower leg, foot, and elbow areas. The report explicitly cites 'Pavement Defective' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors, highlighting driver error in speed choice and hazardous road conditions. Neither occupant was ejected, and both remained conscious. The crash caused damage to the motorcycle's center front end. This incident underscores the peril of defective pavement and excessive speed for motorcyclists in Manhattan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
