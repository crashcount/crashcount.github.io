In the last twelve months, seven people died on the streets of Manhattan CB5. Twenty more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch.

The ramp reopened. The pain lingers.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Local leaders have moved. Council Member Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. They co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><p>Council Member Powers called for <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>using idle congestion pricing cameras</a> for speed and red-light enforcement. The machines sit unused. The streets stay the same.</p><p>&ldquo;By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>said Bottcher</a>. The lane is open. The city is not yet safe.</p><h3 id=the-disaster-is-slow-but-it-is-here>The Disaster Is Slow, But It Is Here</h3><p>Every death is preventable. The city knows what works: slower speeds, daylighted corners, protected lanes. The laws are written. The votes are cast. But the blood dries slow on the crosswalks.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every crosswalk be clear. Demand action before the next name is carved into stone.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Adams argued, “MTA is a statewide obligation. We’re doing our share.” State lawmakers, including Assembly Member Ed Braunstein and State Senator Liz Krueger, countered that the city should help. Hochul’s budget would shift more costs—like Access-A-Ride and student Metrocards—to the city. Progressive lawmakers suggested taxing the wealthy and freezing fares. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins warned, “To increase fares would be detrimental.” The debate continues as the legislature drafts its own budget. No direct safety analysis was provided, but funding gaps threaten transit service, putting vulnerable riders at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
