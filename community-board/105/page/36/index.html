Since 2022, <strong>16 people are dead</strong> here. Eight were walking. Four were riding bikes. The rest were inside the machines. The city kept moving.</p><ul><li>Source: NYC Open Data rollups for this area.</li></ul><h3 id=sixth-avenue-bleeds>Sixth Avenue bleeds</h3><p>A left‑turning SUV hit an 83‑year‑old woman at W 58th and Sixth. She died. It was 10:22 p.m. The record shows a licensed driver, a left turn, and a head injury. The woman had the signal, per the data field. The details are plain, final (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4792095</a>).</p><p>On West 36th and Seventh, at 11:31 p.m., a Toyota SUV going straight struck a 34‑year‑old man in the intersection. The dataset lists &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction.&rdquo; He died there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4728673</a>).</p><p>The area’s worst corridors are written in the logs: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue of the Americas</a> leads the board with 1 death and 101 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>W 51st Street</a> shows three deaths.</p><h3 id=bikes-buses-bodies>Bikes, buses, bodies</h3><p>Two 67‑year‑old e‑bike riders died together at Fifth and West 51st at 3:05 p.m. The record shows head injuries and death. An SUV was parked. The bikes were going straight. There is no why in the file. Only time, place, and two lives gone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4796322</a>).</p><p>At East 51st and Fifth, a southbound bus hit a 39‑year‑old man. The entry says “Not in Roadway.” He died. The bus shows right‑front bumper damage. A parked boom lift sits in the notes like a dumb witness (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4788709</a>).</p><p>Here, bikes take hits, again and again: 612 bicyclist injuries and 18 serious injuries since 2022. Pedestrians: 783 injuries, 32 serious, and 8 deaths. Trucks and buses leave heavier marks: 70 pedestrian injuries tied to large vehicles, with one death in this tally. The numbers are bare and heavy (NYC Open Data rollup).</p><h3 id=when-the-harm-hits-hardest>When the harm hits hardest</h3><p>Pain spikes mid‑afternoon into evening. Three deaths around 3 p.m. One at 4 p.m. Another at 5 p.m. Nights are not quiet. Deaths at 10 a.m., noon, 1 a.m., 6 a.m., 8 a.m., 9 p.m., 10 p.m., 11 p.m. The hours mark the body count (hourly distribution, NYC Open Data).</p><p>The top listed factors read like a shrug: “other” leads with 13 deaths. “Vulnerable road user error” is tagged on two deaths. “Driver inattention/distraction” appears on injuries. “Unsafe speed” barely registers in the local coding, but speed still kills; when it shows up, people break (small‑area factors, NYC Open Data).</p><h3 id=promises-uptown-funerals-midtown>Promises uptown, funerals midtown</h3><p>On Canal Street, the city moved only after two more deaths. A stolen car flew off the bridge at 109 mph and killed Kevin Cruickshank and May Kwok at Bowery and Canal. “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” said the transportation chief (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>, <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>). Advocates warned most of the corridor stays deadly (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>). The pattern is the policy.</p><p>Fourteen blocks north, in CB5, people keep dying at everyday speeds, at ordinary turns, under green lights. The file does not explain. It only counts.</p><h3 id=fix-the-worst-corners-now>Fix the worst corners now</h3><p>Start with the killers we can name. Harden left turns at Sixth Avenue. Give longer LPIs at W 51st. Daylight corners on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue of the Americas</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>W 51st Street</a>. Build truck‑safe turns and bus cameras where buses hit. These are standard tools. They work when installed. Install them here.</p><h3 id=citywide-brakes>Citywide brakes</h3><p>Albany gave New York the tool to lower speeds. The city can use it. A 20 mph default slows the blow. Fewer funerals follow. The case is simple. The ask is old. The lives are new each time. Act now (see our <a href=/take_action/>action guide</a>).</p><p>Repeat speeders keep killing. The Legislature moved a bill to fit speed limiters to the worst drivers. It passed key Senate votes with support from Sen. Krueger. The bill targets drivers with patterns of tickets and points (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a>).</p><p>Lower speeds. Lock the throttle on the repeat offenders. Do it before the next timestamp.</p><h3 id=one-call>One call</h3><p>This district has 16 dead since 2022. Names reduced to rows. Files don’t mourn. People do. Make the call. Ask for slower streets and real limits that hold.</p><p>Take one step today: demand action to slow cars and stop repeat speeders.

The bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, has support from 33 Council members. It follows a deadly Chinatown fire on June 21, 2023, that killed four people. The bill is in committee, with Powers urging Mayor Adams and the FDNY to support it, stating, 'There is a clear consensus that a battery swap program will save lives.' Mayor Adams questioned the program's cost and called for federal, state, and Council funding. FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh backed the need for safe batteries for delivery workers. The Council's push comes as battery fires rise, endangering workers and residents. The bill has broad coalition support, but City Hall has not fully committed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.
