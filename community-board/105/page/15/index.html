But the streets do not change fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany lets the law expire and then debates bringing it back. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p>On 34th Street, the city wants a busway. Some cheer. Some worry about cars clogging side streets. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to prioritize pedestrians and transit users, and not the minority of residents who use their personal cars to get around,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/34th-street-busway-proposal-gets-public-feedback-pro-con-DA4714360>said Charles Todd</a>. Others call for more studies. More waiting. &ldquo;He argued that even if cars largely &lsquo;disappear&rsquo; from 34th Street, they could then &lsquo;impact&rsquo; the surrounding neighborhood, rather than &lsquo;bus riders or bike riders.&rsquo; He called for a &rsquo;traffic study&rsquo; and an &lsquo;action plan.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/34th-street-busway-proposal-gets-public-feedback-pro-con-DA4714360>said Richard Hart</a>.</p><h2 id=the-blunt-edge-of-policy>The Blunt Edge of Policy</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars killed six. Trucks and buses killed two.</strong> Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but they did not kill. The city redesigns intersections. It adds bike lanes. Still, the deaths keep coming. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, the old, the young—pay the price for every delay, every watered-down law, every inch given back to traffic.</p><h2 id=act-no-more-waiting>Act: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets for people, not just for cars.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another name lost. Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible."
