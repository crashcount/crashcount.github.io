In the last twelve months, seven people died on the streets of Manhattan CB5. Twenty more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch.

The ramp reopened. The pain lingers.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Local leaders have moved. Council Member Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. They co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><p>Council Member Powers called for <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>using idle congestion pricing cameras</a> for speed and red-light enforcement. The machines sit unused. The streets stay the same.</p><p>&ldquo;By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>said Bottcher</a>. The lane is open. The city is not yet safe.</p><h3 id=the-disaster-is-slow-but-it-is-here>The Disaster Is Slow, But It Is Here</h3><p>Every death is preventable. The city knows what works: slower speeds, daylighted corners, protected lanes. The laws are written. The votes are cast. But the blood dries slow on the crosswalks.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every crosswalk be clear. Demand action before the next name is carved into stone.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the planting of vegetation on new medians separating bicycle lanes from motorized vehicle traffic.” Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads as primary sponsor, joined by Bottcher, Ossé, Brannan, Hanif, and Brooks-Powers. Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to build new medians between bike lanes and car lanes that can support trees and other vegetation, subject to feasibility. Parks and Recreation must plant or allow planting in these medians.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The chase ended near Dyckman Street when the car slammed into a building and caught fire. The officers 'approached the burning SUV but then left without helping the driver or calling for an ambulance.' They did not report the crash. Both have been suspended while the Force Investigation Division and Attorney General review their actions. The incident follows a February NYPD policy change barring pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' NYPD data shows one in four pursuits last year led to crashes or injuries. The crash exposes the risks of high-speed chases and gaps in police accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pedestrians lose space.</p><p class=mb3>In March 2025, New York City’s Council and Mayor Adams clashed over outdoor dining rules. The 2023 Council bill banned street-side dining from December to March, restoring thousands of spaces to private car storage. The bill’s summary notes, 'outdoor dining is shrinking back to wealthier neighborhoods.' Mayor Adams signed the regulations. Assembly Member Tony Simone called the process 'overburdensome.' Advocates like Sara Lind and Christine Berthet slammed the rules as inequitable and harmful to pedestrians, saying sidewalk cafes now crowd walking space while car parking is prioritized. The Department of Transportation and Council trade blame for the system’s failures. Small businesses face high fees and complex applications, locking out many restaurants. Pedestrian advocates warn the new law pushes more tables into sidewalk space, squeezing walkers and prioritizing cars over people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
