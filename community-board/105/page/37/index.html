But the streets do not change fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany lets the law expire and then debates bringing it back. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p>On 34th Street, the city wants a busway. Some cheer. Some worry about cars clogging side streets. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to prioritize pedestrians and transit users, and not the minority of residents who use their personal cars to get around,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/34th-street-busway-proposal-gets-public-feedback-pro-con-DA4714360>said Charles Todd</a>. Others call for more studies. More waiting. &ldquo;He argued that even if cars largely &lsquo;disappear&rsquo; from 34th Street, they could then &lsquo;impact&rsquo; the surrounding neighborhood, rather than &lsquo;bus riders or bike riders.&rsquo; He called for a &rsquo;traffic study&rsquo; and an &lsquo;action plan.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/34th-street-busway-proposal-gets-public-feedback-pro-con-DA4714360>said Richard Hart</a>.</p><h2 id=the-blunt-edge-of-policy>The Blunt Edge of Policy</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars killed six.

Seven lanes for cars have left little for walkers, cyclists, or bus riders. Since 2019: one pedestrian killed, 198 injured. Advocates demand fewer car lanes, protected bike paths, and wider sidewalks. Change is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On October 12, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) will unveil its Third Avenue redesign proposal to a Manhattan panel. The plan marks the Adams administration's first major street project. The current avenue, with seven northbound car lanes, has seen 703 crashes, one pedestrian death, and 198 injuries since 2019. The matter summary calls for 'reallocation of street space, prioritizing cycling, walking, and public transit over cars.' Advocates like Kate Fillin-Yeh (NACTO) and Paul Krikler (Community Board 8) urge protected bike lanes, busways, and wider sidewalks. Krikler says, 'We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely.' Transportation Alternatives and Community Board 6 echo these demands. The redesign aims to shift space from cars to people, following models like Paris's Rue de Rivoli. The panel's response will shape the future of vulnerable road user safety on Third Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.' Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections.

Senator Liz Krueger says tax revenue will fund enforcement. Vulnerable road users face new risks.</p><p class=mb3>On October 9, 2022, New York State, under Governor Hochul, accelerated cannabis legalization and opened retail shops. The Marijuana Regulation & Taxation Act passed in March 2021. The state now faces a gap: 'there are concerns of increased incidences of driving while impaired after cannabis use,' the Department of Health said. Senator Liz Krueger, a key architect, stated, 'Revenue from our legalized system will be used to pay these ongoing costs.' The Department of Health seeks new technology to detect cannabis impairment, as no standard test exists. Nearly 400 officers are trained as drug recognition experts, with thousands more in training. Critics warn DWI issues should have been solved before legalization. As enforcement lags, vulnerable road users face greater danger from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board, covering Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen, voted 46-0 to send recommendations to Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch and Council member Erik Bottcher. The matter calls for buildings to 'take greater responsibility for the garbage their residents create.' CB4 leaders Jeffrey LeFrancois, Christine Berthet, and Dale Corvino led the charge. Key recommendations include rodent-proof containers, waste compacting, interior trash storage, and moving trash off sidewalks into curb lane corrals. Council member Bottcher supported the effort, stating, 'The status quo isn’t working.' The Department of Sanitation echoed these goals. The resolution targets the city’s notorious sidewalk trash piles, which block and endanger pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, supported by Transportation Alternatives, aims to expose the scale of drivers evading automated enforcement. Bottcher said, 'drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity.' The legislation mandates DOT to post monthly data online and submit annual reports to the mayor and City Council Speaker. Bottcher sponsored the bill, emphasizing the need for public information and accountability. Advocates argue that open data is crucial for safety and enforcement.

The matter, discussed at a Citizens Union breakfast, centered on the future of the Open Restaurants program. Adams said, "Outdoor dining, in my perspective, should be sidewalk. The street extensions were designed to be temporary." The City Council is currently developing legislation to allow restaurants to use parking lanes, but Adams’s comments signal resistance. Council Member Erik Bottcher countered, calling the use of road space for dining "an overall positive development." Adams’s stance ignores the reality that most city sidewalks are too narrow for sidewalk-only dining, squeezing pedestrians and limiting restaurant survival. Advocates and groups like Transportation Alternatives and Open Plans criticized her position, urging the Council to reclaim public space from cars and support vibrant, safe streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition.

The resolution followed the death of 28-year-old cyclist Carling Mott, killed by a truck driver on E. 85th Street. The matter, described as a push to 'bring safe bike routes to the neighborhood,' saw support from councilmembers Keith Powers and Julie Menin, who called on DOT to revisit the 85th Street lane and improve safety infrastructure. Advocates and residents backed the plan, demanding action to prevent more deaths. DOT is reviewing the location for possible upgrades. The board's vote renews a fight stalled since 2016 by political opposition.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
