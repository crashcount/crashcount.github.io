Two bills would force companies to provide safe batteries and fireproof charging. FDNY and city officials backed the push. Delivery workers face grave risk. Action is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2023, the City Council held a hearing on e-bike battery safety. The focus: Intro. 949 and Intro. 950. These bills, sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers, would require the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Sanitation, and FDNY to run a buyback program for safe lithium-ion batteries and mandate companies provide fireproof charging containers. The matter title calls on delivery app companies to 'step up' and protect workers from deadly battery fires. Powers declared, 'We're failing as policy makers if we're not protecting folks from that.' Assistant Commissioner Carlos Ortiz and FDNY Code Counsel Julian Bazel testified in support. Both bills have majority Council backing. The Adams administration supports the spirit of the buyback. Delivery workers, mostly low-income immigrants, face high costs for safe batteries and deadly risk from unsafe ones. In 2023 alone, 63 lithium-ion fires caused 52 injuries and five deaths. The Council’s action targets this systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort comes as New York City faces a surge in deadly fires caused by uncertified lithium-ion batteries used by delivery workers. The initiative, supported by Mayor Adams and Council Member Keith Powers, aims to get safer, certified batteries into the hands of low-income delivery workers. Powers introduced legislation for a citywide buy-back program, stressing, 'we have to make sure that alongside shutting down the market for unsafe batteries, we remember that there are people affected by this.' Uber will also donate $100,000 to the FDNY Foundation for e-bike safety education. The city’s recent plan to combat battery fires highlights the need for private companies to take responsibility.

City Hall resists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 4, 2023, the City Council, led by Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, issued its budget response to the mayor’s $103-billion plan. The Council’s $2.7-billion proposal calls for a near-doubling of Fair Fares funding, $3 million for a battery swap and fire outreach program for delivery workers, and $45.1 million more for road paving. The Council also demands increased investment in street safety infrastructure, especially in communities of color facing high crash rates. Brooks-Powers said, 'New Yorkers deserve access to high-quality services and investments in infrastructure citywide.' Council Member Keith Powers called the battery swap program a 'down payment.' The Council’s push aims to restore cuts and address deadly street conditions. City Hall, citing fiscal pressures, remains cautious but open to negotiation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
