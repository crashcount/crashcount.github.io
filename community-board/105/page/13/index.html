In the last twelve months, seven people died on the streets of Manhattan CB5. Twenty more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch.

The ramp reopened. The pain lingers.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Local leaders have moved. Council Member Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. They co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><p>Council Member Powers called for <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>using idle congestion pricing cameras</a> for speed and red-light enforcement. The machines sit unused. The streets stay the same.</p><p>&ldquo;By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>said Bottcher</a>. The lane is open. The city is not yet safe.</p><h3 id=the-disaster-is-slow-but-it-is-here>The Disaster Is Slow, But It Is Here</h3><p>Every death is preventable. The city knows what works: slower speeds, daylighted corners, protected lanes. The laws are written. The votes are cast. But the blood dries slow on the crosswalks.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every crosswalk be clear. Demand action before the next name is carved into stone.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, held during the third annual Fifth Avenue Holiday Open Street, made the avenue car-free between 48th and 57th Streets. The $150 million plan, as described by Madelyn Wils, will reduce traffic lanes from five to three and widen sidewalks between Bryant Park and Central Park. Powers and other officials voiced strong support for prioritizing pedestrians, echoing Levine’s call to 'do better here' and make Fifth Avenue a true pedestrian destination. The redesign aims to reclaim space for people, not cars, and signals a shift toward safer, more vibrant streets for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is under council review as of December 10, 2024. The measure seeks to overhaul regulations that force NYCHA to keep up over 400 sidewalk sheds—spanning 25 miles—often long after repairs finish. The matter summary states, 'reforming parts of the city’s broader shedding regulations that are a poor fit for NYCHA and a nuisance citywide.' Powers and co-sponsor Erik Bottcher aim to reduce shed length, extend inspection cycles, and allow more art and color on scaffolds. Jamie Rubin, NYCHA board head, supports the bill, noting that current rules rob residents of sunlight, safety, and outdoor space. The bill promises to remove unnecessary sheds, reclaim millions in wasted funds, and improve daily life for public housing residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bicyclist, a 22-year-old male, was partially ejected and sustained injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot, resulting in a severity level 3 injury and shock.

The sedan’s point of impact was the center front end, causing damage to the left front bumper. The bicyclist was not wearing safety equipment. The bicyclist’s own confusion or error is noted but the primary fault lies with the driver’s failure to maintain attention and control.

The Fifth Avenue Association blamed security around Trump Tower. The matter summary reads: 'City scales back hugely popular Fifth Ave. Holiday Open Street despite sales boosts.' Council Member Keith Powers called the move 'surprising' and urged a full return next year. Advocates called it 'frustrating and disappointing.' Mayor Adams had previously praised the program, which boosted sales by $3 million in 2023. The Department of Transportation now touts sidewalk expansion, but the new redesign drops a planned bike lane and may slow buses. Pedestrians and cyclists lose space. The city’s retreat keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
