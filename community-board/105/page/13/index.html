A woman crosses with her child. A cyclist waits for the light. In Manhattan CB5, the street does not forgive. <strong>Fourteen people have died here since 2022.</strong> Over 2,100 have been hurt. Fifty-six were left with wounds that do not heal—broken bones, broken minds, lives split in two. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>Last year, a 34-year-old man was killed in the crosswalk at 7th Avenue and West 36th Street. The driver kept going straight. The pedestrian did not go home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a DOT worker was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near miss on Broadway and Cedar.</strong> The city called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>“abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving”</a>. The worker bled on the sidewalk. The rider fled. No one was arrested.</p><h2 id=hazards-on-every-corner>Hazards on Every Corner</h2><p>The danger is not only in speed. It is in what we allow. <strong>A van crashed in Midtown. Police found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline inside.</strong> A food cart broke loose and struck a parked car with a woman and child inside. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>Firefighters forced entry</a> and pulled out the fuel. The air stank of gas. The city was lucky.</p><h2 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Tony Simone and State Senator Liz Krueger have both voted to extend school speed zones and back bills to curb repeat speeders. Krueger <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on a bill to force speed limiters on the worst drivers. But the city drags its feet. <strong>The 20 mph citywide limit is still not law.</strong></p><p>Council Member Keith Powers called for using idle congestion pricing cameras to catch speeders and reckless drivers, but the equipment sits unused. The streets stay the same. The bodies pile up.</p><blockquote><p>“Our thoughts are with our employee and their loved ones, and we hope they make a quick recovery. We will be coordinating with NYPD to bring the perpetrator to justice.” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>DOT spokesperson</a></p></blockquote><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets that do not kill. The next life lost could be yours, or someone you love.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The review, published December 23, 2024, highlights congestion pricing delays, e-vehicle crackdowns, and increased subway enforcement. The matter notes, 'parents in [Powers'] Manhattan district felt slighted that their kids were left out of the free transportation program.' Powers pressed for fair access, saying, 'we're still hearing from families whose children aren't receiving an OMNY card like their classmates.' Council Member Robert Holden pushed for e-bike licensing, drawing fire from advocates. The review documents a year of policy shifts, enforcement surges, and ongoing fights over who gets safe, affordable transit. Vulnerable riders—students, cyclists, pedestrians—remained at the mercy of city decisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

The article states, “A wrong-way driver fleeing from police struck a bicyclist in Greenwich Village during a chase.” The suspect, pursued on foot by officers, entered a black sedan and hit the cyclist before escaping.

The bill is under council review as of December 10, 2024. The measure seeks to overhaul regulations that force NYCHA to keep up over 400 sidewalk sheds—spanning 25 miles—often long after repairs finish. The matter summary states, 'reforming parts of the city’s broader shedding regulations that are a poor fit for NYCHA and a nuisance citywide.' Powers and co-sponsor Erik Bottcher aim to reduce shed length, extend inspection cycles, and allow more art and color on scaffolds. Jamie Rubin, NYCHA board head, supports the bill, noting that current rules rob residents of sunlight, safety, and outdoor space. The bill promises to remove unnecessary sheds, reclaim millions in wasted funds, and improve daily life for public housing residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
