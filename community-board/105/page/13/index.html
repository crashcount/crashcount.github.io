A woman crosses with her child. A cyclist waits for the light. In Manhattan CB5, the street does not forgive. <strong>Fourteen people have died here since 2022.</strong> Over 2,100 have been hurt. Fifty-six were left with wounds that do not heal—broken bones, broken minds, lives split in two. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>Last year, a 34-year-old man was killed in the crosswalk at 7th Avenue and West 36th Street. The driver kept going straight. The pedestrian did not go home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a DOT worker was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near miss on Broadway and Cedar.</strong> The city called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>“abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving”</a>. The worker bled on the sidewalk. The rider fled. No one was arrested.</p><h2 id=hazards-on-every-corner>Hazards on Every Corner</h2><p>The danger is not only in speed. It is in what we allow. <strong>A van crashed in Midtown. Police found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline inside.</strong> A food cart broke loose and struck a parked car with a woman and child inside. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>Firefighters forced entry</a> and pulled out the fuel. The air stank of gas. The city was lucky.</p><h2 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Tony Simone and State Senator Liz Krueger have both voted to extend school speed zones and back bills to curb repeat speeders. Krueger <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on a bill to force speed limiters on the worst drivers. But the city drags its feet. <strong>The 20 mph citywide limit is still not law.</strong></p><p>Council Member Keith Powers called for using idle congestion pricing cameras to catch speeders and reckless drivers, but the equipment sits unused. The streets stay the same. The bodies pile up.</p><blockquote><p>“Our thoughts are with our employee and their loved ones, and we hope they make a quick recovery. We will be coordinating with NYPD to bring the perpetrator to justice.” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>DOT spokesperson</a></p></blockquote><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets that do not kill. The next life lost could be yours, or someone you love.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, held during the third annual Fifth Avenue Holiday Open Street, made the avenue car-free between 48th and 57th Streets. The $150 million plan, as described by Madelyn Wils, will reduce traffic lanes from five to three and widen sidewalks between Bryant Park and Central Park. Powers and other officials voiced strong support for prioritizing pedestrians, echoing Levine’s call to 'do better here' and make Fifth Avenue a true pedestrian destination. The redesign aims to reclaim space for people, not cars, and signals a shift toward safer, more vibrant streets for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is under council review as of December 10, 2024. The measure seeks to overhaul regulations that force NYCHA to keep up over 400 sidewalk sheds—spanning 25 miles—often long after repairs finish. The matter summary states, 'reforming parts of the city’s broader shedding regulations that are a poor fit for NYCHA and a nuisance citywide.' Powers and co-sponsor Erik Bottcher aim to reduce shed length, extend inspection cycles, and allow more art and color on scaffolds. Jamie Rubin, NYCHA board head, supports the bill, noting that current rules rob residents of sunlight, safety, and outdoor space. The bill promises to remove unnecessary sheds, reclaim millions in wasted funds, and improve daily life for public housing residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cars return. Pedestrians lose ground. Advocates and lawmakers protest. Sales soared last year. Now, the city cites security. Sidewalks may widen, but bike lanes vanish. Buses slow. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>""This is something we should be doing every year across the month of the December, it’s such an easy win for the area in Midtown,"" -- Keith Powers</p><p class=mb3>On December 4, 2024, the Adams administration cut the Fifth Avenue holiday Open Street program in Midtown from three Sundays to just one, shrinking the car-free zone to December 8 between 48th and 55th streets. The Fifth Avenue Association blamed security around Trump Tower. The matter summary reads: 'City scales back hugely popular Fifth Ave. Holiday Open Street despite sales boosts.' Council Member Keith Powers called the move 'surprising' and urged a full return next year. Advocates called it 'frustrating and disappointing.' Mayor Adams had previously praised the program, which boosted sales by $3 million in 2023. The Department of Transportation now touts sidewalk expansion, but the new redesign drops a planned bike lane and may slow buses. Pedestrians and cyclists lose space. The city’s retreat keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
