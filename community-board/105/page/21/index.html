But the streets do not change fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany lets the law expire and then debates bringing it back. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p>On 34th Street, the city wants a busway. Some cheer. Some worry about cars clogging side streets. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to prioritize pedestrians and transit users, and not the minority of residents who use their personal cars to get around,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/34th-street-busway-proposal-gets-public-feedback-pro-con-DA4714360>said Charles Todd</a>. Others call for more studies. More waiting. &ldquo;He argued that even if cars largely &lsquo;disappear&rsquo; from 34th Street, they could then &lsquo;impact&rsquo; the surrounding neighborhood, rather than &lsquo;bus riders or bike riders.&rsquo; He called for a &rsquo;traffic study&rsquo; and an &lsquo;action plan.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/34th-street-busway-proposal-gets-public-feedback-pro-con-DA4714360>said Richard Hart</a>.</p><h2 id=the-blunt-edge-of-policy>The Blunt Edge of Policy</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars killed six. Trucks and buses killed two.</strong> Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but they did not kill. The city redesigns intersections. It adds bike lanes. Still, the deaths keep coming. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, the old, the young—pay the price for every delay, every watered-down law, every inch given back to traffic.</p><h2 id=act-no-more-waiting>Act: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets for people, not just for cars.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another name lost.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting certain commercial establishments from parking vehicles on city streets,' cracks down on auto body shops, mechanics, car rental businesses, and gas stations that use public streets for business parking. Civil penalties range from $250 to $400 per day, with impoundment for repeat violations. The bill excludes car dealerships and carsharing organizations. Council Members Nantasha M. Williams (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Erik D. Bottcher, and Vickie Paladino back the measure. The law aims to reclaim curb space, but the threat to pedestrians and cyclists from double-parked and idling vehicles persists.

The matter summary states: 'Fossil fuel-emitting cruise ships would have to walk the plank and abandon New York City ports unless they plug into clean shore power for energy.' Avilés, at the hearing, said, 'The Red Hook community has not seen economic benefit from this or any other cruise deal—we have seen a negative benefit, and that is traffic, unwieldy, businesses closing because workers can’t get there, honking, car crashes.' The bill also demands traffic mitigation plans for cruise departures. Residents and advocates say the city’s cruise terminals bring only pollution, congestion, and risk to vulnerable road users.

Diesel fumes choke Red Hook. Traffic snarls streets. Locals see no benefit, only harm. The city stalls. Cruise lines profit. Vulnerable New Yorkers breathe dirty air and dodge danger.</p><p class=mb3>Intro. 4 of 2024, sponsored by Councilmember Alexa Avilés (District 38), was introduced on February 18, 2024, and discussed in an oversight hearing. The bill, titled 'Plug it in! NYC lawmakers want diesel-powered cruise ships to connect to shore power or leave,' would force cruise ships at Red Hook and Hell’s Kitchen terminals to connect to the electric grid or be barred from docking. Avilés said, 'The Red Hook community has not seen economic benefit from this or any other cruise deal—we have seen a negative benefit, and that is traffic, unwieldy, businesses closing because workers can’t get there, honking, car crashes.' The bill targets both air pollution and the surge of car and truck traffic that endangers pedestrians and cyclists. Despite a 2017 shore power upgrade in Brooklyn, most ships still idle, spewing diesel. The Economic Development Corporation promises improvements, but locals and Avilés say the city moves too slow, putting residents at risk while cruise companies rake in profits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A sedan traveling south was making a left turn when it struck a bicyclist going straight west. The bicyclist, a 22-year-old female, was ejected from her bike and sustained injuries to her knee, lower leg, and foot, including contusions and bruises. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor to the collision. The sedan showed no damage, while the bike sustained damage to its center front end. The driver’s failure to maintain attention while turning directly led to the impact.
