But the streets do not change fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany lets the law expire and then debates bringing it back. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p>On 34th Street, the city wants a busway. Some cheer. Some worry about cars clogging side streets. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to prioritize pedestrians and transit users, and not the minority of residents who use their personal cars to get around,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/34th-street-busway-proposal-gets-public-feedback-pro-con-DA4714360>said Charles Todd</a>. Others call for more studies. More waiting. &ldquo;He argued that even if cars largely &lsquo;disappear&rsquo; from 34th Street, they could then &lsquo;impact&rsquo; the surrounding neighborhood, rather than &lsquo;bus riders or bike riders.&rsquo; He called for a &rsquo;traffic study&rsquo; and an &lsquo;action plan.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/34th-street-busway-proposal-gets-public-feedback-pro-con-DA4714360>said Richard Hart</a>.</p><h2 id=the-blunt-edge-of-policy>The Blunt Edge of Policy</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars killed six. Trucks and buses killed two.</strong> Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but they did not kill. The city redesigns intersections. It adds bike lanes. Still, the deaths keep coming. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, the old, the young—pay the price for every delay, every watered-down law, every inch given back to traffic.</p><h2 id=act-no-more-waiting>Act: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets for people, not just for cars.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another name lost. Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law lets the city catch drivers who pass stopped buses. Streets near schools stay dangerous. Advocates push for action. City Hall stalls. Children remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. The City Council passed a law allowing a school bus stop-arm camera program. The measure, sponsored by then-Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez and co-sponsored by Keith Powers, empowers the city to install cameras to catch drivers who illegally pass stopped school buses. On September 7, 2022, Mayor Adams’s administration chose not to implement the program, citing ongoing evaluation and a lack of recent deaths from such incidents. Council Member Powers urged the mayor and DOT to use this tool, calling it 'an innovative way to further our goal of promoting street safety.' Activists from StreetsPAC and Transportation Alternatives criticized the delay, noting that streets near schools are especially dangerous for children, particularly in Black and brown neighborhoods. Evidence from other cities shows stop-arm cameras catch hundreds of violations quickly. The law leaves the program to mayoral discretion. City Hall supports speed cameras but has not acted on stop-arm enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, claimed, "the future of New York City is reimagining the use of public space." Mayor Eric Adams said he was open to plazas, bike racks, or curb extensions—anything but more car storage. Despite these statements, the site became street parking. Council Member Keith Powers, representing the district, said, "I would love something more interesting here than parking," and called for renewed discussion on a permanent outdoor dining program. The city’s action contradicts its stated vision. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brad Hoylman, and Assembly Members Dick Gottfried and Linda Rosenthal rallied for the 7 train station at 41st Street and 10th Avenue. The station, once promised as part of the Hudson Yards rezoning, was cut to save money. Bottcher called the cut a 'huge mistake.' Hoylman said it was a 'bait and switch.' Nadler pledged to fight for federal funding. The MTA said it would study the project. The matter: 'Pols and advocates are calling on the MTA to finally build the promised 7 train station at 41st Street and 10th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen.' No formal bill number or committee was cited. The lack of a station keeps riders on foot longer, exposing them to traffic and danger.
