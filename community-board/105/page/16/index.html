The move leaves the MTA’s future in limbo. Board members and city officials push back. Billions for transit hang in the balance. No clear plan replaces lost funds.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul revoked her support for congestion pricing, a policy set to start June 30. The delay, announced without legislative action, sparked backlash. MTA Board member Midori Valdivia vowed, 'I'm going to vote yes to congestion pricing, and that it should start as soon as possible.' Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi echoed, 'It needs to happen now.' Senator Liz Krueger called Hochul's move 'a staggering error.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll and business leader Kathy Wylde criticized the governor’s floated payroll tax hike as unfair to city businesses. The MTA faces a $15 billion shortfall, with no replacement funding in sight. The delay keeps streets clogged and transit underfunded, risking more danger for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers lose safe, reliable transit.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul halted New York’s congestion pricing program, which was set to start June 30. The plan, designed to charge most drivers $15 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street, would have funded $15 billion in MTA capital improvements. The bill’s summary warns: 'No plan B for transit investments should congestion pricing not go through.' Senator Liz Krueger, mentioned in the debate, criticized the lack of alternative funding, saying, 'She is not aware of what she is referring to or where she believes that money will come from.' The delay leaves critical projects—like subway accessibility, new signals, and electric buses—unfunded. Without this money, vulnerable riders face more delays, breakdowns, and unsafe conditions. The City Council and transit advocates express deep disappointment and concern for New York’s future.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders and workers face uncertainty as lawmakers reject new burdens and demand fairer solutions.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, State Sen. Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged. Vulnerable road users are left exposed as transit funding falters.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter at hand: 'Gov. Hochul revoked her support for congestion pricing less than a month before it was supposed to start.'
