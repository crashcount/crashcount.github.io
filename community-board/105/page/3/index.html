Bottcher</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2025, Council Member Robert Holden and animal advocates rallied at City Hall, demanding passage of Ryder's Law to ban horse-drawn carriages in New York City. The bill, sponsored by Holden, has not yet reached a council vote or hearing. The rally followed a 'not guilty' verdict in a high-profile horse abuse case. The matter, described as a push 'to end the horse carriage industry in NYC,' drew support from NYCLASS and others. Holden blasted city oversight as 'inexcusable.' Despite the outcry, a safety analyst notes: ending horse carriages will not significantly improve safety for pedestrians or cyclists, since carriages are a small part of street traffic and their removal does not fix systemic road dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
