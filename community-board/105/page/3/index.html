Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in Manhattan CB5. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Each body broken on the street is a life cut short, a family left waiting for a voice that will not answer.</p><p>Just this spring, a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>34-year-old man was killed crossing 7th Avenue</a>. The driver kept going straight. The pedestrian never got up. The cause: driver inattention. The city calls it a crash. The family calls it a loss that does not heal.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-break>Patterns That Do Not Break</h3><p><strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> In the last year, CB5 saw 1,504 crashes, 822 injuries, and 20 serious injuries. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. Three people over 65 killed. Two more over 75. No one is spared. Cars, SUVs, trucks, taxis—they all take their share. <strong>SUVs alone killed six pedestrians</strong> in this district since 2022. Buses and trucks add to the toll. The city’s data does not show mercy.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Some leaders have acted. Assembly Member Tony Simone <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored a bill</a> to expand speed camera enforcement. State Senator Liz Krueger <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. But the streets remain deadly. Council Member Keith Powers called for using idle congestion pricing cameras for enforcement, saying, &ldquo;[The state] certainly should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>nypost.com</a>).</p><p>Residents are not fooled by promises. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Nita</a>. The city’s pace is slow. The street does not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who delay, by systems that favor speed over safety. The dead cannot call for change. The living must do it for them.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets where a walk does not end in blood.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Video shows the vehicles touching in a V shape. Investigator Nelson Yu, a retired NYPD detective, confronted the woman, demanding identification and handcuffing her after she failed to produce ID. Yu ordered, 'Get out of the car and show some ID,' and later, 'Get in the car! You're not going anywhere!' The woman was placed in the back seat of Yu’s vehicle. The arrest was later voided. The Attorney General’s office stated, 'OAG is investigating this matter internally and will not have further comment at this time.'

In Central Park, pedestrians have the right of way at all times.

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No bill number or committee is listed, but the $2-million program stems from a 2023 bill by Council Member Keith Powers. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'The Adams administration is both cracking down on e-bikes and providing safer e-bikes to workers.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'This is not just about protecting delivery workers. It’s about protecting them, their families, their neighbors, and all New Yorkers from deadly fires.' Delivery worker William Medina praised the program, but called for expansion. The program lets workers trade uncertified bikes or illegal mopeds for certified e-bikes, but covers only a fraction of the city’s 80,000 delivery workers. The safety analyst notes: Cracking down may burden vulnerable users, while safer bikes help; mixed signals mean no clear safety gain. The city’s approach leaves vulnerable road users in limbo.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
