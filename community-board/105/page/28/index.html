In the last twelve months, seven people died on the streets of Manhattan CB5. Twenty more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch.

The ramp reopened. The pain lingers.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Local leaders have moved. Council Member Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. They co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><p>Council Member Powers called for <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>using idle congestion pricing cameras</a> for speed and red-light enforcement. The machines sit unused. The streets stay the same.</p><p>&ldquo;By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>said Bottcher</a>. The lane is open. The city is not yet safe.</p><h3 id=the-disaster-is-slow-but-it-is-here>The Disaster Is Slow, But It Is Here</h3><p>Every death is preventable. The city knows what works: slower speeds, daylighted corners, protected lanes. The laws are written. The votes are cast. But the blood dries slow on the crosswalks.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every crosswalk be clear. Demand action before the next name is carved into stone.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill sought to amend city code by setting penalties for alternate side parking violations at $65 for a first offense and $100 for each subsequent offense within a 12-month period. After three violations in a year, the vehicle would be towed if found in violation again. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing penalties for alternate side parking violations and requiring towing of certain vehicles in violation of alternate side parking rules.' Council Members Erik D. Bottcher (primary sponsor) and Lincoln Restler (co-sponsor) led the effort. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023.

The bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, has support from 33 Council members. It follows a deadly Chinatown fire on June 21, 2023, that killed four people. The bill is in committee, with Powers urging Mayor Adams and the FDNY to support it, stating, 'There is a clear consensus that a battery swap program will save lives.' Mayor Adams questioned the program's cost and called for federal, state, and Council funding. FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh backed the need for safe batteries for delivery workers. The Council's push comes as battery fires rise, endangering workers and residents. The bill has broad coalition support, but City Hall has not fully committed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
