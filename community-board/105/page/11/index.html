An SUV turns left. The man does not make it to the other side. In the last twelve months, seven people have died in Manhattan CB5. Twenty-two more were seriously injured. The numbers do not flinch: 1,190 crashes, 676 injuries. Each one a life changed or ended. The dead are old and young. A woman, 83, crossing with the signal. A cyclist, 67, struck by an SUV. A pedestrian, 34, killed by a distracted driver. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>SUVs killed six. Buses, trucks, taxis, bikes, and sedans left dozens more hurt. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The bike lane is not safe. The city counts the bodies and moves on. Delivery workers and immigrants ride for work and get criminal summonses for minor bike violations. Drivers who kill often walk away. As one cyclist <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/02/mondays-headlines-critical-mass-edition>said</a>, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not actually protecting cyclists [but] putting them in more danger and in more harm.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Local leaders talk about safety. They pass bills. They hold press conferences. Mayor Adams <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>says</a>, &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; But the city drags its feet. Sammy’s Law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit stays high. Speed cameras save lives, but the law to keep them is always about to expire. Police crack down on cyclists and e-bike riders, not on the drivers who kill. As one protester <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/it-seems-unfair-e-bike-riders-protest-nypd-crackdown-and-criminal-summonses>argued</a>, &ldquo;It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next? Demand More</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand the city redesign streets for people, not cars. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to become a number. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Citi Bike rider failed to yield the right-of-way and disregarded traffic control, as cited in both the narrative and the contributing factors. The report notes the bike bore no damage after the collision. The pedestrian’s action—crossing with the signal—is listed in the report, but only after the rider’s failure to yield and disregard for traffic controls.
