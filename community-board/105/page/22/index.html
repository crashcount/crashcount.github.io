Bottcher and Hoylman-Sigal both called out reckless drivers as the real threat. Assembly Member Tony Simone joined, pushing for statewide laws to curb dangerous delivery app practices. Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project highlighted how apps force delivery workers into risky behavior, but noted that new minimum pay rates help slow things down. The campaign focuses on education, not punishment, and centers the voices of workers and vulnerable road users.

Five crashes since January 2023. Two dozen hurt in one. Assemblyman Tony Simone demands hearings. Riders lose trust. MTA claims safety, but investigations mount. Danger rides the rails. Riders wait for answers.</p><p class=mb3>On January 11, 2024, Assemblyman Tony Simone (District 75) responded to a surge in NYC subway derailments—five incidents from January 2023 to January 2024, the most since 2011. Simone called for hearings into MTA safety, saying, 'At this point, I’ve got concerns about the MTA’s ability to build the public trust in their system.' The incidents include a Bronx work train derailment, an F train crash in Brooklyn, and a No. 1 line collision that injured two dozen. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein warned, 'each derailment has repercussions across the entire system.' The MTA, led by Transit President Rich Davey, denies systemic failure but faces probes from the NTSB after recent accidents and a track worker’s death. Simone’s push for oversight comes as congestion pricing nears, raising the stakes for public safety and trust.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
