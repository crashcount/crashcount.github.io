An SUV turns left. The man does not make it to the other side. In the last twelve months, seven people died on the streets of Manhattan CB5. Twenty-two more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Three of the dead were over 65. Two were under 35. The sidewalk does not forgive.</p><p>Cars, SUVs, and trucks did most of the killing. In the last three years, SUVs alone took six lives and left dozens more broken. Buses, taxis, and bikes added to the count. The city records the wounds. It does not record the empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. It talks about safety. It talks about the future. But the present is still full of pain. Mayor Adams <a href=https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/2024/vision-zero-update>says</a>, “One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.” The words are right. The pace is slow.</p><p>The NYPD cracks down on cyclists and delivery workers. They write criminal summonses for riding on sidewalks or having the wrong bike. Commissioner Jessica Tisch <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/cyclists-protest-nypd-criminalization-push-against-bikers-for-traffic-infractions-AD4665020>states</a>, “When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.” The crackdown does not stop the cars. It does not slow the SUVs. It does not protect the old woman in the crosswalk.</p><h3 id=the-fight-for-safer-streets>The Fight for Safer Streets</h3><p>The city has started to act. Fifth Avenue will get wider sidewalks. The mayor <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/transit/2025/05/22/plan-for-pedestrian-friendly-fifth-avenue-redesign-faces-backlash>promises $400 million for people on foot</a>. But the work is not done. The blood is not dry.</p><p>Advocates must not wait. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for the most vulnerable. Every day of delay is another day of loss.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
