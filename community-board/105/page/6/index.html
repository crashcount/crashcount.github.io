Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in Manhattan CB5. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Each body broken on the street is a life cut short, a family left waiting for a voice that will not answer.</p><p>Just this spring, a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>34-year-old man was killed crossing 7th Avenue</a>. The driver kept going straight. The pedestrian never got up. The cause: driver inattention. The city calls it a crash. The family calls it a loss that does not heal.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-break>Patterns That Do Not Break</h3><p><strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> In the last year, CB5 saw 1,504 crashes, 822 injuries, and 20 serious injuries. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. Three people over 65 killed. Two more over 75. No one is spared. Cars, SUVs, trucks, taxis—they all take their share. <strong>SUVs alone killed six pedestrians</strong> in this district since 2022. Buses and trucks add to the toll. The city’s data does not show mercy.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Some leaders have acted. Assembly Member Tony Simone <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored a bill</a> to expand speed camera enforcement. State Senator Liz Krueger <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. But the streets remain deadly. Council Member Keith Powers called for using idle congestion pricing cameras for enforcement, saying, &ldquo;[The state] certainly should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>nypost.com</a>).</p><p>Residents are not fooled by promises. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Nita</a>. The city’s pace is slow. The street does not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who delay, by systems that favor speed over safety. The dead cannot call for change. The living must do it for them.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets where a walk does not end in blood.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates call out the city’s misplaced priorities.</p><p class=mb3>On June 10, 2025, Council Member Keith Powers introduced a bill to lower e-bike speed limits to 15 miles per hour, following Mayor Adams’s call for action. The measure, discussed in the Council but not yet assigned a bill number or committee, comes as Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch launches a crackdown on cyclists. Powers said, "I am interested in all measures that might address keeping our street experience here in the city feeling much safer and slowing down any vehicle or device or instrument that could hurt someone." Despite state authority to lower car speed limits, neither the mayor nor the Council act to curb car speeds citywide. Advocates and some officials slam the focus on e-bikes, pointing to data: cars and trucks cause nearly all pedestrian injuries. The safety analyst notes no direct safety impact for vulnerable users, as no specific policy change is enacted. The city’s priorities remain clear—and deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Sean Ryan (District 61) with co-sponsors Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Samra Brouk, Leroy Comrie, Patricia Fahy, Pete Harckham, Robert Jackson, Liz Krueger, and Christopher Ryan, pushes for roads built for everyone. The Senate voted, with most in favor and a block opposed. The bill's language is blunt: roads must be safe for all, not just drivers. No safety analyst note was provided, but the intent is clear—prioritize vulnerable road users in every street plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, not yet numbered or assigned to committee, follows Mayor Adams's push to address what he calls street 'chaos.' Powers said, 'Biking is a crucial tool to tackle the climate crisis... but we also must address the well-documented concerns about safety.' He proposes a $50 penalty for violations. Critics, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, call the measure 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' warning it escalates the city's 'misguided war on biking.' Safety analyst notes show the policy may discourage cycling, reducing mode shift from cars and undermining safety in numbers. Enforcement has historically targeted Black and brown cyclists, while drivers—responsible for most deaths—face lighter penalties. The bill risks making streets less safe for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, "Forcing horses to pound the pavement with heavy carriages in Midtown, where they compete with motor vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians, is inhumane." Seventeen council members, led by Robert Holden (bill sponsor) and Erik Bottcher (district includes stables), support the ban. Speaker Adrienne Adams has blocked a hearing and vote. The piece highlights recent incidents where bolting horses injured at least four people, including a pedicab driver.

The streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-05-31) reports on a protest in Lower Manhattan against the NYPD’s policy of issuing criminal summonses to e-bike riders for traffic violations like running red lights or riding against traffic. Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers. Policy gaps and unequal penalties expose systemic danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
