On November 8, 2023, the transportation committee of Manhattan’s Community Board 6 voted 8-1 to oppose the measure, calling it 'harmful and unnecessarily punitive.' The matter’s summary: 'require license and registration for all types of e-bikes.' Council Members Keith Powers and Julie Menin support the bill; Carlina Rivera has not signed on. The committee’s resolution states the proposal would negatively impact all cyclists, especially delivery workers, and fails to address illegal mopeds or require point-of-sale registration. Critics argue the bill is regressive, ineffective, and would not improve safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
