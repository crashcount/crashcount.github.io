In the last twelve months, seven people died on the streets of Manhattan CB5. Twenty more were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch.

The ramp reopened. The pain lingers.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Local leaders have moved. Council Member Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. They co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><p>Council Member Powers called for <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>using idle congestion pricing cameras</a> for speed and red-light enforcement. The machines sit unused. The streets stay the same.</p><p>&ldquo;By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>said Bottcher</a>. The lane is open. The city is not yet safe.</p><h3 id=the-disaster-is-slow-but-it-is-here>The Disaster Is Slow, But It Is Here</h3><p>Every death is preventable. The city knows what works: slower speeds, daylighted corners, protected lanes. The laws are written. The votes are cast. But the blood dries slow on the crosswalks.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every crosswalk be clear. Demand action before the next name is carved into stone.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution pushes Albany to let New York City set its own speed limits and demands stronger protections for people hurt or killed by cars.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0090-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 28, 2024, it urges the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), A.1901 (Crash Victims Bill of Rights), and the full SAFE Streets Act package. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ in relation to allowing New York city to establish a lower speed limit, and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gutiérrez, Restler, Ossé, Avilés, Sanchez, Krishnan, Rivera, Cabán, Brewer, Abreu, Marte, Brannan, Schulman, Won, Feliz, Bottcher, Nurse, Hudson, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The SAFE Streets Act targets reckless driving, demands safer street design, and gives crash victims more rights. The resolution’s focus is clear: fewer deaths, more justice, safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks,' orders the Department of Transportation to install at least 100 illuminated, solar-powered traffic control devices at crosswalks each year for five years—a total of 500. The department must also study their impact compared to unlit signs. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, Won, Narcisse, Hanks, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Hudson, Schulman, and Avilés. The bill was laid over by committee on June 25, 2024. No safety analyst note was provided. Vulnerable road users remain exposed while the city delays action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Selvena N.

The bill makes it unlawful to drive with fake or expired plates, including temporary ones. Civil penalties apply, but drivers with expired plates get a 10-day window to fix the issue. The bill aims to close loopholes that let reckless drivers evade detection and accountability.
