They demand public space, not car storage. The city brought cars back after flood wall work. Residents call it a missed chance. They want a waterfront for people.</p><p class=mb3>On August 19, 2024, Manhattan’s Community Board 6 and Council Member Keith Powers pushed to convert the parking lot under the FDR Drive, between E. 18th and E. 23rd streets, into public space. The lot, closed for years during flood wall construction, reopened for parking despite calls for change. The matter summary reads: 'An underused parking lot below the FDR Drive should finally turn into a community space instead of car storage, according to residents and politicians.' Sandy McKee, CB6 chair, said, 'If we took away the cars, it would be a visible connection through to the waterfront.' Powers backed the move, stressing the need for public access. The board sent a resolution to the Economic Development Corporation. The city claims it still needs the space for construction and right-of-way management. No formal bill number or committee is listed. The push echoes similar highway conversions in Toronto and Brooklyn.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Projects for safer, more accessible transit hang in the balance. Albany leaders mostly stay silent.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, State Sen. Jeremy Cooney, new chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, issued a public demand for Governor Hochul to deliver a '100-day plan' to replace the $16.5 billion MTA funding shortfall caused by her cancellation of congestion pricing. In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of funding jeopardizes projects vital to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move aims to stop deadly basement charging and bring safety to delivery workers. A new battery trade-in program will target dangerous lithium-ion batteries and mopeds. Community resistance remains.</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a new initiative to permit private sidewalk e-bike and moped charging stations. The program, previewed at a press conference with Mayor Adams, will open for applications by year’s end after a public hearing on August 21. The matter, described as making it 'easier and faster for property owners to install public battery charging and swapping cabinets,' seeks to replace illegal, hazardous charging hubs with regulated infrastructure. Council Member Keith Powers, who sponsored last year’s battery trade-in law, said, 'No one wants to use—or be anywhere near—batteries that aren't safe to charge.' Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh called current illegal charging 'effectively death traps.' The city will also fund a $2 million battery and moped trade-in program. Delivery worker advocates want the new stations to be free or low-cost. Community board opposition has slowed previous efforts. The mayor remains neutral on state e-bike registration proposals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
