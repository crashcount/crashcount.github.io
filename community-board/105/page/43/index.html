But the streets do not change fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany lets the law expire and then debates bringing it back. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p>On 34th Street, the city wants a busway. Some cheer. Some worry about cars clogging side streets. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to prioritize pedestrians and transit users, and not the minority of residents who use their personal cars to get around,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/34th-street-busway-proposal-gets-public-feedback-pro-con-DA4714360>said Charles Todd</a>. Others call for more studies. More waiting. &ldquo;He argued that even if cars largely &lsquo;disappear&rsquo; from 34th Street, they could then &lsquo;impact&rsquo; the surrounding neighborhood, rather than &lsquo;bus riders or bike riders.&rsquo; He called for a &rsquo;traffic study&rsquo; and an &lsquo;action plan.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/34th-street-busway-proposal-gets-public-feedback-pro-con-DA4714360>said Richard Hart</a>.</p><h2 id=the-blunt-edge-of-policy>The Blunt Edge of Policy</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars killed six. Trucks and buses killed two.</strong> Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but they did not kill. The city redesigns intersections. It adds bike lanes. Still, the deaths keep coming. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, the old, the young—pay the price for every delay, every watered-down law, every inch given back to traffic.</p><h2 id=act-no-more-waiting>Act: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Call your council member.

The new Department of Investigation (DOI) boss, Jocelyn Strauber, hesitated to confirm if placard abuse is a problem, despite a 2019 law requiring DOI and NYPD to investigate and report on the issue. Council Member Erik Bottcher pressed Strauber, citing resident complaints about fake placards and blocked curbs. Bottcher said, 'NYPD traffic enforcement agents are not issuing tickets to many people using counterfeit placards.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the lack of a digital placard system and is drafting new enforcement legislation. Local Law 6 mandates weekly sweeps and monthly reports, but agencies have failed to comply. The Adams administration has not advanced citizen enforcement.

The Department of Investigation (DOI) was to review and report by September 30, 2020. Agencies missed deadlines, citing pandemic and staffing shortages.

The hearing highlighted the matter: 'Standing still zone: Two-year-old parking placard abuse probe stuck in bureaucratic time warp, NYC investigator blames COVID.'

Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance called it 'one of the most important busways in the City.' Despite proven success elsewhere, business interests stalled progress.
