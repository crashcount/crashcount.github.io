Introduced September 26, 2024, it urges the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.5008A/A.803A. The measure would 'establish a bicycle lane safety program in the city of New York to enforce certain restrictions on the use of bicycle lanes and protected bicycle lanes by means of bicycle lane photo devices.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, and Erik D. Bottcher back the resolution. The bill aims to let the city use cameras to catch and fine drivers who block bike lanes. Cyclists remain exposed.

The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, a detail included in the narrative, but only after the primary driver error. The report describes the aftermath in stark terms: 'Her face split open on the steel. Blood pooled on the pavement. The car never moved. She did, and then didn’t.'
