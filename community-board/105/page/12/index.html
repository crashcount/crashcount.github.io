A woman crosses with her child. A cyclist waits for the light. In Manhattan CB5, the street does not forgive. <strong>Fourteen people have died here since 2022.</strong> Over 2,100 have been hurt. Fifty-six were left with wounds that do not heal—broken bones, broken minds, lives split in two. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>Last year, a 34-year-old man was killed in the crosswalk at 7th Avenue and West 36th Street. The driver kept going straight. The pedestrian did not go home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a DOT worker was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near miss on Broadway and Cedar.</strong> The city called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>“abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving”</a>. The worker bled on the sidewalk. The rider fled. No one was arrested.</p><h2 id=hazards-on-every-corner>Hazards on Every Corner</h2><p>The danger is not only in speed. It is in what we allow. <strong>A van crashed in Midtown. Police found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline inside.</strong> A food cart broke loose and struck a parked car with a woman and child inside. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>Firefighters forced entry</a> and pulled out the fuel. The air stank of gas. The city was lucky.</p><h2 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Tony Simone and State Senator Liz Krueger have both voted to extend school speed zones and back bills to curb repeat speeders. Krueger <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on a bill to force speed limiters on the worst drivers. But the city drags its feet. <strong>The 20 mph citywide limit is still not law.</strong></p><p>Council Member Keith Powers called for using idle congestion pricing cameras to catch speeders and reckless drivers, but the equipment sits unused. The streets stay the same. The bodies pile up.</p><blockquote><p>“Our thoughts are with our employee and their loved ones, and we hope they make a quick recovery. We will be coordinating with NYPD to bring the perpetrator to justice.” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>DOT spokesperson</a></p></blockquote><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets that do not kill. The next life lost could be yours, or someone you love.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled "MTA eyes new taxes, fees to plug $33B budget hole — even after NYC’s $9 congestion toll!", landed in the spotlight after the new toll failed to close the gap. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, district 35, formally objected to the unfunded capital plan with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. Their joint letter blocked the plan’s January 1 start, forcing negotiations. Governor Hochul, who backs the $68 billion plan, promised no income tax hikes but left other taxes and fees on the table. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called for transparency. The MTA’s future—and the safety of those who rely on it—hangs in the balance. No direct safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On January 6, 2025, Council Member Tony Simone announced a legislative push to require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years.

The bill summary states: 'My legislation will require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years.' Simone urges the use of congestion pricing revenue for these safety upgrades, arguing, 'No priority is higher on any rider's mind, including mine, than safety on the system.'
