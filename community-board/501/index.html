A car turns left. The man does not make it home. On January 6, a 68-year-old was killed crossing Forest Avenue. The police report lists the cause: &ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo; and &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). No arrest. No second chance.</p><p>On May 17, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, was crossing Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him. &ldquo;Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY</a>). He died at Richmond University Medical Center. The investigation drags on. The street stays the same.</p><p>On June 29, a 16-year-old riding an electric scooter collided with a Hyundai Tucson. He suffered head trauma and died (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>). The driver stayed. The boy did not.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, four people have died and 834 have been injured on these streets. Eleven were seriously hurt.</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, sons, neighbors. In three and a half years, 17 people have died in Staten Island CB1. More than 2,600 have been injured. Most were walking, biking, or riding. Cars and SUVs did the most harm—five deaths, 293 minor injuries, 137 moderate injuries, three serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed three more. Motorcycles and mopeds, bikes, and vans add to the toll.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted to extend school speed zones, improving child pedestrian safety (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Others do not. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill to curb repeat speeders, opposing a measure that would have forced the most dangerous drivers to slow down (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done so citywide. Cameras catch speeders, but some politicians call them a burden. The streets remain deadly.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-action-not-excuses>Call to Action: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call your state senator. Tell them to lower speed limits, expand enforcement, and redesign streets for people, not cars. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with those who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.
