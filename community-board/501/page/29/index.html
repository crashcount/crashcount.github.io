Twenty-eight left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In just over three years, Staten Island CB1 has seen 5,339 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. In the last twelve months alone, four people died. Eleven more suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed in Westerleigh.</strong> The police said he suffered head trauma. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The story repeats itself. &ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>reported The Brooklyn Paper</a>.</p><p>On July 5th, a motorcyclist died on Bay Street. A car made a K-turn. The bike hit the door. The rider was rushed to the hospital. He did not make it. &ldquo;A motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>wrote amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—438 incidents, five deaths. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds, three more. Bikes: seven injuries, no deaths. The street is not neutral. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children crossing the street. Others block progress. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill that would have curbed repeat speeders—drivers who rack up violations and keep killing. The bill would have forced them to slow down. He said no. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act—or do not. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Delivery workers still pay for safety. Sixteen dead, 253 fires this year. City backs the bill. Tech giants resist supplying safe batteries. Workers face high costs. Danger persists on city streets.</p><p class=mb3>On December 11, 2023, a congressional panel advanced the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act, introduced by Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-Bronx). The bill, supported by the city and FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh, requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to create federal safety standards for micromobility batteries. The matter summary states the bill aims to 'protect against the risk of fires.' Torres and advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project pushed for app-based companies to supply certified batteries, but tech giants oppose this. Kavanagh said, 'A strong federal standard for lithium-ion batteries is required to ensure public safety.' Despite new laws, the cost of safe batteries—up to $5,000—still falls on low-paid delivery workers. Sixteen people have died in 253 battery fires this year. The city passed a buyback program for faulty batteries, but it has not started. The burden remains on the most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users wait.</p><p class=mb3>On December 8, 2023, the MTA board approved its congestion pricing plan. The plan, now entering a 60-day public review, sets a $15 daytime toll for drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The matter, titled 'Don’t expect changes to MTA's congestion pricing even after final public review,' underscores the board's resistance to major changes. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'If you change one aspect – the whole thing starts to unravel or fall apart.' Council Member Robert F. Holden was mentioned in the discussion. The board is reconsidering tolls on school buses, but most exemptions are opposed. Lawsuits from New Jersey officials threaten delays. The plan’s fate hangs on legal and public scrutiny, but for now, the structure stands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They demand transit options get a fair shot before bulldozers roll. Critics say the highway will fuel sprawl, worsen air, and ignore climate goals. The Turnpike Authority pushes ahead. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 16, 2023, the Portland City Council unanimously passed a resolution targeting the Gorham Connector highway project. The matter, described as a call to 'stop its work on the highway until rapid transit options have been properly examined,' urges the Maine Turnpike Authority to pause construction. Council members cited climate change and Maine’s emissions goals, demanding transit and land-use reforms come first. The council’s action follows a 2012 study warning that new roads alone won’t fix traffic. Local groups like GrowSmart Maine and businesses such as Smiling Hill Farm oppose the project, fearing it will worsen sprawl and pollution. Despite council opposition and federal funding for transit studies, the Turnpike Authority continues land acquisition and environmental reviews. Vulnerable road users face increased risk if the highway moves forward without transit alternatives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders wait. Promises break. Advocates demand real bus rapid transit: center lanes, fast boarding, tough enforcement. Without action, the city’s buses crawl. Vulnerable riders pay the price in time and danger.</p><p class=mb3>This Streetsblog NYC analysis, published November 13, 2023, examines New York’s failure to deliver true Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). The article, titled 'Want More Rapid Bus Transit? Build Real Bus Rapid Transit,' criticizes Mayor Adams for not following through on campaign pledges to expand bus lanes and implement full BRT. Advocates like Annie Weinstock and JP Patafio argue that dedicated center-running lanes, off-board fare collection, and strict enforcement are needed to speed up buses and protect riders. The piece notes, 'Current bus lanes, like on Utica [Avenue], really it’s almost like a parking lot, because they cover the plates and there’s no enforcement.' The report highlights that without strong leadership and commitment, bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—remain exposed to slow service and street danger. No council bill number or committee is attached; this is a policy analysis and advocacy call to action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
