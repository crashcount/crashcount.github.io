His name was Nacere Ellis. He died from head trauma after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The driver stayed at the scene. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported</a> the NYPD is still investigating.</p><p>A week later, a 13-year-old boy on a moped collided with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. It was 1 a.m. He left the street in critical condition, a head injury sending him to Richmond University Medical Center. The bus driver and passengers walked away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7 wrote</a> nothing about what led up to the crash.

The numbers keep rising. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The dead and injured are not numbers. They are neighbors. In the last 12 months alone, 5 people died and 13 were seriously hurt. Children under 18 made up about one in eight of the injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>5 deaths and 3 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all left their mark. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The silence from local leaders is loud. Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to curb repeat speeders, a measure that could have forced the most dangerous drivers to slow down. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted no</a> even as the bodies piled up. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted <strong>yes</strong> to extend school speed zones, a small step for child safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>He did his part</a>.

The law hits the vulnerable hardest.

Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people first. The dead cannot speak.

The article, titled 'Understanding Car Culture ‘Denialism’ Can Help Safety Advocates Respond,' details how fake experts, logical fallacies, and shifting demands block alternatives to car-centric streets. Council Member Robert Holden is named for pushing e-bike licensing, a move described as 'extremely harmful' for vulnerable road users. The article criticizes engineers and community boards who resist bike lanes and street redesigns. It urges advocates to call out denialist rhetoric and challenge the roots of car-first policies.

Holden (District 30) was spotlighted for proposing legislation to require licensing and registration for all e-bikes. The measure, discussed in an advocacy article, has not advanced to committee or vote. The article states: 'Council Member Robert Holden has proposed legislation to require licensing and registration for all e-bikes. This legislation will be extremely harmful if it becomes law—likely cutting e-bike use, increasing motorcycle and car emissions and traffic, and forfeiting economic benefits associated with micro-mobility.' Holden’s push aligns with car-centric policy, drawing sharp criticism from safety advocates. They argue the bill would endanger vulnerable road users by forcing more people into cars and away from safer, sustainable options. The piece calls for direct confrontation of denialist rhetoric and a shift from car dependency to protect lives on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver of the Volvo, a 78-year-old woman, was killed. She was not wearing a seatbelt and suffered fatal crush injuries. The report lists 'Other Vehicular' as a contributing factor, indicating a driver-related error but does not specify further. The SUV was traveling straight ahead with two occupants; the Volvo was also moving straight before impact. The police narrative describes the crash as a violent collision that left the sedan’s driver dead at the scene. No contributing factors are attributed to the SUV or its occupants.

Riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On February 25, 2024, the City Council, led by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), publicly criticized the Department of Transportation for missing legal mandates on new bus and bike lane construction. The matter, titled 'Spinning wheels: Adams admin misses legal benchmarks for new bus, bike lanes for second year in a row, DOT data shows,' revealed DOT built only 31.9 miles of protected bike lanes and 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes in 2023—far short of the 50 and 30 miles required by the Streets Master Plan. Brooks-Powers stated, 'The Streets Plan is the law, and the Department of Transportation is still failing to fulfill its legal obligations.' She promised to hold DOT accountable at an upcoming budget hearing. The city also lagged on bus stop upgrades, completing just 54 out of 500 required. Cyclist fatalities soared to 30 in 2023, the highest this century. Advocates and council members warn that continued delays and weakened projects put vulnerable road users at greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board’s transportation committee chair called the changes 'long overdue.' The plan, discussed in workshops since spring 2023, would reduce the avenue from three to two moving lanes each way, add parking-protected bike lanes, and install painted pedestrian islands. Board members, including Katie Walsh and Gabino Morales, voiced strong support, with Morales stating, 'This is just a beginning of what we could do to fix our community.' Diana Gonzalez described the avenue as a place where 'they're gonna kill you.' The board will urge DOT to go beyond paint and install hard infrastructure. DOT aims to finalize plans after further traffic analysis, with implementation possible in late 2024.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan will close the current narrow walkway this fall and replace it with an eight-foot-wide path for cyclists and pedestrians by year’s end. The project is part of a broader push to make three MTA bridges accessible to non-drivers. MTA Construction and Development President Jamie Torres-Springer said, 'The MTA has made great progress in planned capital improvements to pedestrian and bike accessibility on bridges.' Local cyclist Allegra LeGrande called the move overdue, noting, 'If they build it they will come.' The project includes a cantilevered ramp for wheelchair access and improved exits. While the path is closed, a shuttle bus may run for six weeks. The overhaul answers years of calls for safe, direct bike connections between the Bronx and Manhattan, and throws down a challenge to city agencies to fix the patchwork of local bike paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One driver, unlicensed and traveling west in a 2004 sedan, contributed to the collision through unsafe speed and unsafe lane changing. The crash involved three vehicles: a sedan from Texas, and two New York-registered vehicles including a 2017 SUV and a 2019 sedan. The impact points included center front end, right front quarter panel, and left front bumper. Four male occupants, aged 24 to 33, suffered whiplash injuries to the neck and head, all conscious and restrained by lap belts and harnesses. The report highlights driver errors—unsafe speed and lane changing—as primary factors, with no contributing victim behaviors noted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Narrow machines cut paths on bridges and avenues. Streets gleamed. But sidewalks stayed buried. Pedestrians faced ice and slush. Officials praised their work. Landlords lagged. The city’s promise stopped at the curb.</p><p class=mb3>On February 13, 2024, city agencies responded to the second major snowstorm of the year. The Departments of Sanitation and Transportation used narrow plows to clear bike lanes, including the East River bridges and key protected paths. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "We put salt on every street, every highway, every bike lane in the city, we've done multiple passes at it." The DOT boasted about clearing the Brooklyn Bridge bike path before sunrise. Citi Bike stayed open. But sidewalks, left to property owners, remained treacherous. Mayor Adams praised road crews while standing by snow-covered pedestrian space. Commissioner Tisch warned, "We want those sidewalks safe tomorrow." The city’s effort favored cyclists and drivers. Pedestrians were left behind, forced to wait for landlords to shovel. The gap in sidewalk clearing remains a systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
