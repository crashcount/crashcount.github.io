The story does not. On June 29, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter was struck by a Hyundai Tucson. He died of head trauma. The police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No comfort. Just another family left with a hole in it.</p><p>A month earlier, a 58-year-old man tried to cross Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him. He died at the hospital. The driver was thrown from the scooter. The police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>&ldquo;upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma.&rdquo;</a> No charges. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-are-names>The Numbers Are Names</h2><p><strong>Since 2022, 2,645 people have been hurt in crashes here.</strong></p><p>Children, elders, workers, neighbors. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. Trucks, motorcycles, bikes, and now e-scooters join in. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are careful. They do not care if you are loved.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted to extend school speed zones, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>improving child pedestrian safety.</a> He has pushed for safer streets, daylighting, and protected bike lanes. But others block the way. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill that would curb repeat speeders. He also opposed reauthorizing speed cameras, proven to save lives.</p><p><strong>Every delay means another family gets the call.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat dangerous drivers. Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Stand with the living. Speak for the dead.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren. Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The study, led by HDR, will look at expanding the bridge’s narrow lanes to meet federal standards and possibly adding more lanes. The matter summary states the goal is to 'relieve congestion and improve traffic flow.' State Senator Andrew Lanza pushed for the study, calling the bridge 'very narrow therefore very dangerous.' Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton acknowledged induced demand and said the study will consider all options, including a shared-use path for cyclists and pedestrians. Former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz opposed widening, urging investment in public transit instead. The study’s outcome could shape the future safety of vulnerable road users crossing between Staten Island and New Jersey.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The complaint, citing false arrest and retaliation, states: "Mr. White now brings this suit seeking redress for the violations of his own rights, as well as seeking changes to Defendant City's policies and practices around responding appropriately, and without retaliation, to civilian complaints about illegal 'ghost cars,' 'ghost plates,' and other traffic misconduct."

DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton and Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, refused to provide current figures, promising data next year. Brooks-Powers called this 'unacceptable.' She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency. Staffing shortages and council opposition to projects were cited as obstacles.

Riders, not drivers, stand to gain.</p><p class=mb3>On September 7, 2023, Philadelphia announced an $18 million program to provide over 22,000 public employees with all-access transit passes on SEPTA. The policy, led by Mayor Jim Kenney, is a pilot to support hiring, retention, sustainability, traffic safety, and equity. Kenney called it 'an opportunity to boost the city’s hiring and retention efforts, and support our goals of sustainability, traffic safety, and equity.' Project manager Sandi Ramos highlighted the program’s savings for workers and its equitable impact. Council Member Charles Allen in D.C. and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu have pushed similar ideas, but funding and jurisdictional issues stall progress elsewhere. The program’s focus is clear: more transit riders, fewer cars, safer streets. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the policy centers vulnerable road users by shifting trips from cars to transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
