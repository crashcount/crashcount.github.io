An e-scooter hit him. He died in the hospital. The driver was thrown from the scooter. No arrests. No answers. Police could not confirm the speed or direction of the e-scooter at the time of the collision (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>AMNY report</a>). The street stayed open. The blood washed away. The danger did not.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> on Staten Island CB1 streets. <strong>Nine more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Seven of the dead or gravely hurt were over 55. Children were not spared: <strong>93 kids were injured</strong> in crashes in the last year. The numbers do not rest. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=streets-that-do-not-forgive>Streets That Do Not Forgive</h2><p>Most deaths came from cars and SUVs. <strong>Sedans killed two. SUVs killed three.</strong> Trucks, buses, and vans took more. Bikes and mopeds left their own scars. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise. A man in a crosswalk on Forest Avenue was hit by an SUV. He died. The driver failed to yield. He never stood a chance (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Police cars crash too. In March, two officers swerved to avoid a U-turn and slammed into a restaurant. &ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>witness account</a>) said a witness. The officers lived. Next time, it could be a child on the sidewalk.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; But the speed limit on most streets is still 25 mph. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower it to 20 mph. They have not done it. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city calls for more enforcement. The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The study, led by HDR, will look at expanding the bridge’s narrow lanes to meet federal standards and possibly adding more lanes. The matter summary states the goal is to 'relieve congestion and improve traffic flow.' State Senator Andrew Lanza pushed for the study, calling the bridge 'very narrow therefore very dangerous.' Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton acknowledged induced demand and said the study will consider all options, including a shared-use path for cyclists and pedestrians. Former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz opposed widening, urging investment in public transit instead. The study’s outcome could shape the future safety of vulnerable road users crossing between Staten Island and New Jersey.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case stems from a November 11, 2022 arrest after White removed a plastic cover from a license plate he believed was obscured to dodge traffic cameras. The complaint, citing false arrest and retaliation, states: "Mr. White now brings this suit seeking redress for the violations of his own rights, as well as seeking changes to Defendant City's policies and practices around responding appropriately, and without retaliation, to civilian complaints about illegal 'ghost cars,' 'ghost plates,' and other traffic misconduct." The suit names Sholem Klein, head of the Rockaway Nassau Safety Patrol, as the complainant who called police. The Brooklyn DA later dropped charges against White. The lawsuit seeks damages and policy reforms to protect civilians who report illegal traffic activity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law requires 150 miles of protected bus lanes and 250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026. In 2022, the city built only 4.4 miles of bus lanes and 26.3 miles of bike lanes, far short of the legal benchmarks. Councilmember Lincoln Restler criticized political interference, saying, 'We're at a point where it's all politics all the time, and we're failing to execute.'

DOT leaders dodged numbers, citing delays and staff shortages. The hearing exposed deep rifts over accountability. Vulnerable road users wait as city agencies stall and argue.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2023, the City Council Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, held an oversight hearing on the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) compliance with the Streets Master Plan under Local Law 195. Brooks-Powers demanded specifics: 'DOT has struggled to meet its legal mandate. In 2021, DOT installed just 4.4 miles of bus lane—well below 20-mile requirement.' DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton and Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, refused to provide current figures, promising data next year. Brooks-Powers called this 'unacceptable.' She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency. Staffing shortages and council opposition to projects were cited as obstacles. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>"Gov. Moore, like his predecessor, can’t honestly sell the toll lane plan on its merits, so he has to fall back on smoke and mirrors. His administration is trying to dress up the project as primarily about public transit. But that’s just a marketing ploy and a distraction." -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On September 11, 2023, Maryland’s Democratic Governor Wes Moore announced plans to continue a $4.032-billion highway expansion along interstates 495 and 270. The project, first championed by Republican Larry Hogan, adds two toll lanes each way, with just three percent of funds for sustainable transit. The official summary claims 'new improvements' and uses language of equity and sustainability. Advocates like Janet Gallant and Ben Crowther call it 'greenwashing' and a 'marketing ploy.' Brian O’Malley points to the climate crisis. Lawsuits challenge the plan, which critics say will worsen health and climate impacts, especially for Black and brown communities. The debate exposes a bipartisan pattern: leaders from both parties keep widening highways, ignoring the toll on vulnerable road users and communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, led by Mayor Jim Kenney, is a pilot to support hiring, retention, sustainability, traffic safety, and equity. Kenney called it 'an opportunity to boost the city’s hiring and retention efforts, and support our goals of sustainability, traffic safety, and equity.' Project manager Sandi Ramos highlighted the program’s savings for workers and its equitable impact. Council Member Charles Allen in D.C. and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu have pushed similar ideas, but funding and jurisdictional issues stall progress elsewhere. The program’s focus is clear: more transit riders, fewer cars, safer streets. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the policy centers vulnerable road users by shifting trips from cars to transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
