Eight seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, Staten Island CB1 has seen 897 crashes, 490 injuries, and 3 deaths. The numbers are not just numbers. They are fathers, sons, neighbors. They are people who never made it home.</p><p>On July 5th, Jeremy Claudio rode his motorcycle down Bay Street. A driver made a K-turn. Claudio hit the door. He died at the hospital. Police said the driver was &ldquo;making a K-turn from the northbound lane&mldr; into its southbound lane when the collision occurred&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>amNY</a>). No arrest. Another family left with nothing but questions.</p><p>In May, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca tried to cross Targee Street. An e-scooter struck him. &ldquo;Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma,&rdquo; police said (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY</a>). He died at Richmond University Medical Center. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks, and now e-scooters.</strong> The killers change, but the pattern does not. In the last three years, cars and SUVs caused most deaths and injuries to pedestrians. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the toll (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>Some leaders act. Some look away. Assembly Member Charles Fall has backed safer street designs and called out city delays. But others, like State Senator Andrew Lanza, voted against reauthorizing the city’s speed camera program—a tool proven to save lives (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The cameras are still here, but only because advocates refused to let up.</p><p><strong>Every delay is a death sentence.</strong> Every excuse is another family’s grief.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras everywhere children walk. Demand streets that put people before cars.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot speak. You can. Act before another name is added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Routes shift. Stops thin out. Riders brace for longer walks. Council Member Brooks-Powers warns of harm to her district. The city lags on bus lanes. Public review looms. Vulnerable riders face uncertainty.</p><p class=mb3>On December 12, 2023, the MTA released its final proposal for the Queens bus network redesign. The plan, shaped by two years of outreach, proposes 121 routes—eight more than before—but cuts and combines stops, aiming for straighter lines and faster trips. The matter summary states the redesign seeks 'improved travel speed and reliability.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, voiced 'serious concerns about the proposal’s impact on her constituents, especially with the looming arrival of congestion pricing.' She called for an 'equitable and balanced' approach. The plan faces backlash over wider stop spacing and fewer stops, which could force longer walks for riders—many of them elderly or disabled. The city has failed to meet its legal mandate for new bus lanes, building only 18 miles this year. The proposal enters public review ahead of a 2025 rollout.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Delivery workers still pay for safety. Sixteen dead, 253 fires this year. City backs the bill. Tech giants resist supplying safe batteries. Workers face high costs. Danger persists on city streets.</p><p class=mb3>On December 11, 2023, a congressional panel advanced the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act, introduced by Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-Bronx). The bill, supported by the city and FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh, requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to create federal safety standards for micromobility batteries. The matter summary states the bill aims to 'protect against the risk of fires.' Torres and advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project pushed for app-based companies to supply certified batteries, but tech giants oppose this. Kavanagh said, 'A strong federal standard for lithium-ion batteries is required to ensure public safety.' Despite new laws, the cost of safe batteries—up to $5,000—still falls on low-paid delivery workers. Sixteen people have died in 253 battery fires this year. The city passed a buyback program for faulty batteries, but it has not started. The burden remains on the most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'If you change one aspect – the whole thing starts to unravel or fall apart.' Council Member Robert F. Holden was mentioned in the discussion.
