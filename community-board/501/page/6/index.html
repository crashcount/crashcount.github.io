An e-scooter hit him. He died in the hospital. The driver was thrown from the scooter. No arrests. No answers. Police could not confirm the speed or direction of the e-scooter at the time of the collision (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>AMNY report</a>). The street stayed open. The blood washed away. The danger did not.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> on Staten Island CB1 streets. <strong>Nine more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Seven of the dead or gravely hurt were over 55. Children were not spared: <strong>93 kids were injured</strong> in crashes in the last year. The numbers do not rest. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=streets-that-do-not-forgive>Streets That Do Not Forgive</h2><p>Most deaths came from cars and SUVs. <strong>Sedans killed two. SUVs killed three.</strong> Trucks, buses, and vans took more. Bikes and mopeds left their own scars. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise. A man in a crosswalk on Forest Avenue was hit by an SUV. He died. The driver failed to yield. He never stood a chance (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Police cars crash too. In March, two officers swerved to avoid a U-turn and slammed into a restaurant. &ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>witness account</a>) said a witness. The officers lived. Next time, it could be a child on the sidewalk.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; But the speed limit on most streets is still 25 mph. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower it to 20 mph. They have not done it. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city calls for more enforcement. The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The program, launched in fall 2023, uses sensors to detect overweight trucks and issue $650 fines. According to the city, overweight truck crossings on the Queens-bound BQE dropped from 7,920 daily to about 3,041 per month—a 60% reduction. The sensors are set to expand to the Staten Island-bound side this year. Restler said, "Weigh-in-Motion technology has successfully eliminated 60% of the overweight truck traffic on the Queens bound BQE." The Department of Transportation and Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez praised the program's impact and called it a potential national model.

Restler said he hopes for similar results on the Staten Island-bound lanes. The bill authorizing the program is set to expire, prompting calls for urgent legislative action. Rodriguez called the technology a 'national model.' Lawmakers want to expand the system to other sites, including the Washington Bridge. The crackdown aims to reduce illegal truck loads, which threaten road safety and infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pedestrians and cyclists lose out.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2025, organizers announced another reduction to the Vanderbilt Avenue Open Street program. The change, reported by Streetsblog NYC, limits car-free hours to Saturdays only from May to September—a 50 percent cut from last year’s already reduced schedule. The program, once a weekend staple from spring to fall, now faces its smallest footprint yet. Alex Morano, a volunteer organizer, called the rollback 'really unfortunate,' stressing the street’s value to the neighborhood. Saskia Haegens, Chair of the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Corporation, urged full city funding, saying the program is 'transformative.' Organizers blame insufficient city support, with less than half the cost covered this year. The Department of Transportation claims $10 million in annual support and promises a permanent redesign, but for now, cars win back space. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, families—lose a vital refuge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter title states: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation that would require the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide free express bus fare to New York City students who take express buses to and from school.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers is the primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Justin L. Brannan, Shahana K. Hanif, Kamillah Hanks, and Tiffany Cabán. The bill highlights the steep $7 express bus fare, which leaves students in transit deserts with few safe, affordable options.

The action followed President Trump’s inauguration. The page, described as 'not political but focused on safety and access for all road users,' offered technical guides for bike lanes and sidewalks. Its deletion, reported by Streetsblog NYC, is seen as part of a broader purge of diversity and environmental initiatives. Heidi Simon, a leading advocate, said, 'It's disheartening to know that there are people in the trenches at the local and state level who relied on these resources to get their jobs done, and their jobs just got made harder.' The loss scatters vital research, making it harder for cities—especially smaller ones—to build safer streets.

Hochul faces pressure to let New York City charge for residential street parking. The plan targets illegal registrations, raises MTA funds, and could cut traffic. Critics say current rules reward fraud and endanger cyclists. Reform means fewer cars, safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 20, 2025, an editorial published by Streetsblog NYC called for Governor Hochul and state leaders to grant New York City the authority to create citywide, resident-only parking zones. The piece, titled 'Gov. Hochul Could Transform Our City with Parking Reform,' argues, 'With permission from the state, New York City could enact a citywide, resident-only parking system. Non-residents needn’t be banned from parking here, just charged for it, with the money going to the MTA.' The editorial highlights rampant illegal vehicle registrations and the dangers they pose, including uninsured cars and increased risk for cyclists. The proposal urges charging both residents and visitors for parking, with higher rates in dense, wealthy areas. The plan aims to reduce congestion, generate MTA revenue, and reclaim curb space for safer uses. No council member is directly named, as this is an opinion piece, but the call is clear: state action is needed to protect vulnerable road users and restore trust in public space management.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets clear, but danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On February 13, 2025, the MTA reported results from its Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) expansion, which began in August 2024. The program, described as 'bus-mounted camera tickets to drivers who double-park along bus routes or park in bus stops,' has issued over 400,000 tickets in five months. The ACE system grew from 623 buses on 14 routes to 1,000 buses on 34 routes by November. MTA spokesperson Laura Cala-Rauch said the program 'is having a big impact on speeding buses and improving the quality of life for New Yorkers.' Data from Jehiah Czebotar shows cameras now issue 76.4% of bus lane and stop tickets—93% by December. Bus speeds rose 5%, crashes involving buses dropped 20%, and emissions fell up to 10%. Persistent violators remain, with some drivers racking up five tickets. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called for escalating fines and legislative changes to target repeat offenders. The ACE program marks a shift toward automated, consistent enforcement, but loopholes for chronic blockers persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
