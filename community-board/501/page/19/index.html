Twenty-eight left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In just over three years, Staten Island CB1 has seen 5,339 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. In the last twelve months alone, four people died. Eleven more suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed in Westerleigh.</strong> The police said he suffered head trauma. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The story repeats itself. &ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>reported The Brooklyn Paper</a>.</p><p>On July 5th, a motorcyclist died on Bay Street. A car made a K-turn. The bike hit the door. The rider was rushed to the hospital. He did not make it. &ldquo;A motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>wrote amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—438 incidents, five deaths. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds, three more. Bikes: seven injuries, no deaths. The street is not neutral. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children crossing the street. Others block progress. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill that would have curbed repeat speeders—drivers who rack up violations and keep killing. The bill would have forced them to slow down. He said no. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act—or do not. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Five killed, 170 injured in five years. Councilwoman Julie Won backs the plan. Truckers and owners protest. DOT pushes forward. Streets stay deadly. Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The controversy centers on a planned bike lane in Queens’ District 26, championed by Councilwoman Julie Won. The city aims to connect the Pulaski and Kosciuszko bridges via Borden, Starr, and Review avenues. The project, requested by local civic groups and the community board, follows five deaths—including two cyclists—and over 170 injuries on these roads in five years. Won stated, 'We need to do everything we can to ensure we don’t lose another life to a preventable death.' Thirty-two business owners petitioned DOT to halt the project, citing truck maneuvering dangers. DOT representative Vincent Barone called the route 'a critical gap' in the bike network and promised 'much-needed safety improvements.' The plan will take up to 15 feet from Review Avenue for a two-way bike path and buffer, leaving 22 feet for traffic. The fight underscores the city’s struggle to protect vulnerable road users in truck-heavy corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price while drivers dodge the toll.</p><p class=mb3>On June 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul unilaterally paused New York’s congestion pricing law, first enacted in 2019 to fund the MTA’s $55 billion capital plan. The move slashed $15 billion from transit budgets, threatening repairs and upgrades. Hochul claimed to act for cost-of-living relief, but polling shows her approval at a record low. Republicans seized credit for the pause, while Democrats saw no political gain. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called it sabotage: 'Governor Kathy Hochul took a gamble when she sabotaged our public transit system for political gain and she lost dearly.' The MTA now faces a $33 billion shortfall for its next plan. No new revenue source is in place. The legislature, as Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany notes, already did its job by passing the law. The pause leaves transit riders stranded, while car traffic and systemic danger persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders lose lifelines. Streets fill with cars. Congestion rises. Pedestrians and cyclists face more danger. New York’s MTA repair plans gutted after congestion pricing dies. Leaders stall. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published September 20, 2024, details a wave of transit funding crises nationwide, with New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) at the center. The article, titled '‘Doom Loop’ Alert: Transit Systems are Suffering — And Too Many Are Cutting Service,' chronicles how pandemic relief funds are running dry, ridership lags, and costs soar. Governor Kathy Hochul killed congestion pricing, stripping the MTA of $1 billion a year. Now, the agency slashes repair programs. Streetsblog quotes transit leaders warning that service cuts mean crowded buses, more cars, and lost productivity. Council members and mayors in cities like Miami and Philadelphia face similar choices. The story makes clear: when transit fails, vulnerable road users—those who walk, bike, or rely on buses—face greater risk. The systemic danger grows as public transportation falters and streets fill with traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Congestion is up. The city lags on bus and bike lanes. Governor Hochul’s pause on congestion pricing leaves streets clogged. Vulnerable road users face rising danger as cars reclaim the city.</p><p class=mb3>A new Streetlight Data report, released September 12, 2024, shows car miles traveled in the New York City metro area rose 14 percent over five years. The report singles out New York: 'where congestion pricing was paused, stands out as the urban core with the biggest increase in both congestion and VMT among the top 25.' Governor Hochul’s decision to halt congestion pricing drew sharp criticism from advocates. Sara Lind, Co-Executive Director of Open Plans, called the move 'disastrous,' warning that abandoning congestion pricing is a 'dereliction of duty' on street safety. The report blames city inaction on bus and bike lanes for worsening gridlock. As driving surges, vulnerable road users face greater risk. The city’s failure to curb car use puts lives on the line.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Anger filled the streets.</p><p class=mb3>On September 8, 2024, a coalition of transit advocates and elected officials, including Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, gathered in Manhattan to protest Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing. The event, described as a 'citywide subway accessibility day of action,' spotlighted the $15 billion shortfall now facing the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan. According to the event summary, 'the cancellation of elevator installations at 23 subway stations' followed the funding cut. Gallagher condemned the decision, declaring, 'We all matter, and we all need elevators, and we all need congestion pricing.' Comptroller Brad Lander called the move 'shameful.' The rally demanded immediate reinstatement of congestion pricing to restore funding for subway accessibility, directly impacting disabled New Yorkers, parents, and seniors.

The Department of Design and Construction managed the seven-year build, but its maintenance agreement with the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative expired in 2018. Since then, city agencies have passed responsibility back and forth. The Parks Department, now tasked with care, cites budget cuts and overworked staff. Mayor Adams slashed $20 million from the Parks budget, worsening the crisis. Katherine Walsh, Community Board 7 Transportation Committee chair, calls the neglect an equity issue, highlighting Sunset Park’s high pollution and health risks. Brian Hedden of the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative urges a citywide fix. The matter title: 'Dead Trees Highlight Multiple City Failures on Sunset Park Greenway.'

The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
