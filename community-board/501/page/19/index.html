A machine ends his life. In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> on Staten Island CB1 roads. <strong>Eight hundred thirty-four were hurt</strong>. Eleven were left with wounds so deep they will not heal. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers, neighbors—no one is spared.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a motorcyclist was killed on Bay Street. Police said he collided with a car making a K-turn. A <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car on Staten Island during the Fourth of July holiday weekend</a>. The driver stayed. The man died. The street kept moving.</p><p>In May, an e-scooter struck a man crossing Targee Street. The impact threw the rider. The pedestrian, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, was pronounced dead at the hospital. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma throughout his body</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h3><p>The dead do not get a vote. The living do. Local leaders have made moves. Assembly Member Charles Fall <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, a step that protects children. Senator Andrew Lanza <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted no on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill that would have forced repeat dangerous drivers to slow down. The bill passed anyway. But the message is clear: <strong>some leaders stand up for safety, others stand in the way</strong>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Most deaths come from cars and trucks. Four killed. Hundreds hurt. Motorcycles and mopeds take lives too. Bikes are not blameless, but their toll is small. The street is a battlefield, and the biggest machines win.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone with power. Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them: <strong>slow the cars, redesign the streets, protect the people who walk and ride</strong>. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Demand action. Demand it now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The biggest gains come in dense city neighborhoods. Diesel buses choke streets with toxic air. Electric buses could clear the air and save lives.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2024, a Carnegie Mellon University study analyzed the impact of electrifying America’s bus fleet. The report, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found that replacing diesel buses with electric models could cut 40 million metric tons of greenhouse gases by 2035. The study summary states, 'America would reap massive public health and emissions-reduction benefits from electrifying its bus fleet.' Researcher Sofia Martinez said, 'We definitely need to be advocates for electrification, and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants in any way we can.' The study urges more federal subsidies to speed up the transition. Even replacing aging diesel buses as they retire would cut 35 million tons of CO2. The report stresses the greatest public health gains would come from electrifying buses in the most densely populated neighborhoods, where diesel pollution hits hardest. The study calls for urgent action to protect city dwellers from toxic air.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council and DOT hold the power. Advocates say language matters. Streets remain deadly. Action lags. Lives hang in balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 8, 2024, Mayor Eric Adams publicly supported lowering speed limits after the passage of 'Sammy’s Law,' which allows New York City to reduce limits to 20 mph on most roads. The law, passed in the state budget, excludes wide, multi-lane roads in the outer boroughs. Adams said, 'I do believe as New Yorkers we need to slow down,' but repeatedly referred to preventable crashes as 'accidents,' a term advocates reject for removing driver responsibility. The City Council must legislate any citywide speed limit change, while the Department of Transportation (DOT) can adjust limits on specific streets after community input. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Speaker Adrienne Adams pledged to 'collaborate and negotiate' with City Hall. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi stressed the need for street redesign and legal reform, noting, 'This is not a problem that goes away on its own.' Despite new authority, the Adams administration has lagged on safe street infrastructure. The city faces its deadliest start to a year in the Vision Zero era, with 60 killed in the first quarter.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
