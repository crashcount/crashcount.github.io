Twenty-eight left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In just over three years, Staten Island CB1 has seen 5,339 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. In the last twelve months alone, four people died. Eleven more suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed in Westerleigh.</strong> The police said he suffered head trauma. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The story repeats itself. &ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>reported The Brooklyn Paper</a>.</p><p>On July 5th, a motorcyclist died on Bay Street. A car made a K-turn. The bike hit the door. The rider was rushed to the hospital. He did not make it. &ldquo;A motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>wrote amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—438 incidents, five deaths. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds, three more. Bikes: seven injuries, no deaths. The street is not neutral. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children crossing the street. Others block progress. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill that would have curbed repeat speeders—drivers who rack up violations and keep killing. The bill would have forced them to slow down. He said no. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act—or do not. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On January 6, 2025, Council Member Tony Simone announced a legislative push to require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years.

The bill summary states: 'My legislation will require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years.' Simone urges the use of congestion pricing revenue for these safety upgrades, arguing, 'No priority is higher on any rider's mind, including mine, than safety on the system.' Simone is the primary sponsor.

The matter, titled "MTA eyes new taxes, fees to plug $33B budget hole — even after NYC’s $9 congestion toll!", landed in the spotlight after the new toll failed to close the gap. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, district 35, formally objected to the unfunded capital plan with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. Their joint letter blocked the plan’s January 1 start, forcing negotiations. Governor Hochul, who backs the $68 billion plan, promised no income tax hikes but left other taxes and fees on the table. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called for transparency. The MTA’s future—and the safety of those who rely on it—hangs in the balance.

Hochul defended her pause, then reversed course after the election. Former Governor Cuomo and Hochul both failed to deliver the toll on time.

The pedestrian was crossing outside a signal or crosswalk when the collision occurred. The vehicle struck the pedestrian with its right front bumper, sustaining damage to that area. The report cites slippery pavement as a contributing factor, indicating hazardous road conditions that likely impaired the driver's ability to maintain control. No driver license issues were noted, but the environmental condition played a role in the crash. The pedestrian suffered injuries to his entire body, experienced shock, and complained of pain or nausea. The report does not list any pedestrian behaviors as contributing factors, focusing instead on the vehicle's interaction with the pedestrian and the slippery road surface.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Stewart-Cousins and Carl Heastie cited a $33 billion funding gap, stating, 'The proposed program currently faces a significant funding deficit... which is a specific concern that needs to be addressed before we can approve the program.' The rejection halts contracts for new train cars and electrical upgrades. The MTA now has ten days to respond. This move follows delays from Governor Hochul’s congestion pricing pause.

USDOT approved a rule for automatic pedestrian emergency braking in new cars. Atlanta passed a right-on-red ban. St. Louis invested $300 million in sustainable transport.

The collision impact was on the left front bumper of one vehicle and the left side doors of the other. Both vehicles sustained damage consistent with the described points of impact. The injured driver was wearing a lap belt and was not ejected from the vehicle. The male driver of the other sedan was licensed and traveling straight ahead at the time of the crash. The report does not list any victim behaviors as contributing factors, focusing on vehicle control failure and driver distraction as the primary causes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The move comes weeks before new congestion tolls hit Manhattan. The matter, titled 'MTA plans fare hike as it OKs $1.27B train car purchase weeks before new congestion toll: ‘Keep the grift alive’,' drew fire from Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who called the fare and toll hikes a 'scam' and accused the MTA of mismanagement. Holden’s comments echo broader council criticism of the MTA’s spending and question the effectiveness of congestion pricing. MTA officials defend the investment, citing improved reliability and safety with the new R211 cars. No independent safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s status is an approved agency action, not a council vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, reported by Streetsblog NYC, centers on New York’s offer of over $100 million for New Jersey Transit, potentially as an annual payment from congestion toll revenue. Hochul said, 'We've made multiple offers to settle this lawsuit. Very generous offers.' New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy refused, risking further strain on NJ Transit, which recently raised fares 15 percent. Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum called Murphy’s stance 'a stubbornness tax' paid by transit riders. Environmental advocates criticized Murphy for blocking improvements to public transportation. The congestion pricing program, set to be the nation’s first, remains tied up in court. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, now entering its last public feedback phase, will be reviewed by the MTA Board in early winter 2025 and implemented by late summer. The proposal includes over $30 million in new funding, 17 new local routes, and increased frequency for 17 lines, but also service reductions on 29 routes. The main highlight is the introduction of 'rush' routes to connect riders to rail faster. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'Every change to a route has an impact on the schedule... and we did it.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards voiced support, stating, 'I'm ready. We're ready.' The process began in 2019 and was shaped by extensive community input.
