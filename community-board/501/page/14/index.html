His name was Nacere Ellis. He died from head trauma after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The driver stayed at the scene. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported</a> the NYPD is still investigating.</p><p>A week later, a 13-year-old boy on a moped collided with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. It was 1 a.m. He left the street in critical condition, a head injury sending him to Richmond University Medical Center. The bus driver and passengers walked away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7 wrote</a> nothing about what led up to the crash.

The numbers keep rising. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The dead and injured are not numbers. They are neighbors. In the last 12 months alone, 5 people died and 13 were seriously hurt. Children under 18 made up about one in eight of the injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>5 deaths and 3 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all left their mark. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The silence from local leaders is loud. Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to curb repeat speeders, a measure that could have forced the most dangerous drivers to slow down. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted no</a> even as the bodies piled up. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted <strong>yes</strong> to extend school speed zones, a small step for child safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>He did his part</a>.

The law hits the vulnerable hardest.

Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people first. The dead cannot speak.

Ra stated, “here she is responsible for BOTH a car trip and a train ride to get to the same place.” The matter, though not a formal bill, highlights political opposition to congestion pricing and official transit promotion. Ra’s comments, echoed by Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, stress the disconnect between officials’ privileges and the daily reality for vulnerable road users.

The piece, titled 'A Brush With Danger Made Me Exhibit A in My Fight for Better Bike Lanes in Brooklyn,' describes the lack of protected bike lanes in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. The author recounts merging into traffic, being closely followed by a driver, and crashing on a wet, greasy iron grid. The car sped away. Passersby helped. The cyclist suffered a broken collarbone. The essay notes, 'Our area of Brooklyn is a major hole in the borough's protected bike lane network.' Council Member Shahana Hanif attended a community meeting on the issue. The call is clear: Brooklyn’s streets favor cars, not people. The absence of protected lanes leaves cyclists exposed and injured. The system’s neglect is the danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Simone urges the use of congestion pricing revenue for these safety upgrades, arguing, 'No priority is higher on any rider's mind, including mine, than safety on the system.'

The new Manhattan congestion toll hits drivers, but it is not enough. Senate leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins objects to the unfunded plan. More taxes and fees loom. Riders wait. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On January 6, 2025, the MTA’s $33 billion budget shortfall dominated debate. The matter, titled "MTA eyes new taxes, fees to plug $33B budget hole — even after NYC’s $9 congestion toll!", landed in the spotlight after the new toll failed to close the gap. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, district 35, formally objected to the unfunded capital plan with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. Their joint letter blocked the plan’s January 1 start, forcing negotiations. Governor Hochul, who backs the $68 billion plan, promised no income tax hikes but left other taxes and fees on the table. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called for transparency. The MTA’s future—and the safety of those who rely on it—hangs in the balance. No direct safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'A speeding sedan slammed an SUV mid-turn. Steel crumpled.' The impact left a 30-year-old male occupant with severe head lacerations; he remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor. The sedan was traveling straight ahead, while the SUV was turning, and the crash resulted in significant damage to both vehicles. The injured man was not wearing a seatbelt, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor to the crash itself. The focus remains on the excessive speed of the sedan, which led to the violent collision and serious injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers—walkers, cyclists, straphangers—face more risk as the system crumbles.</p><p class=mb3>""Millions of riders are depending on Albany leaders to put together a capital program that fixes and upgrades the subway from all of the deferred maintenance of past decades and to anticipate all of the new challenges associated with climate change from extreme heat to rising seas to heavy rainfall."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On December 24, 2024, state legislative leaders, including Andrea Stewart-Cousins of District 35, rejected the MTA’s $65.4 billion capital plan. The plan, reviewed by the Capital Plan Review Board, aimed to restore and upgrade New York’s aging mass transit. Stewart-Cousins and Carl Heastie cited a $33 billion funding gap, stating, 'The proposed program currently faces a significant funding deficit... which is a specific concern that needs to be addressed before we can approve the program.' The rejection halts contracts for new train cars and electrical upgrades. The MTA now has ten days to respond. This move follows delays from Governor Hochul’s congestion pricing pause. Advocates warn that without funding, the system risks breakdowns and fare hikes. Riders, especially those without cars, are left exposed as the city’s transit backbone weakens.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Congestion pricing staggered forward. Pedestrian braking tech became law. Atlanta banned right-on-red. Cities poured millions into transit. Yet, the death toll from cars barely budged. Streets remain dangerous. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>This is a year-in-review, not a single bill, but it covers major 2024 policy actions. Streetsblog’s December 23, 2024 recap highlights the struggle to end car carnage. The piece notes, 'America's first-ever congestion pricing program had been paused at the 11th hour... brought back in November, though in a sadly diminished form.' USDOT approved a rule for automatic pedestrian emergency braking in new cars. Atlanta passed a right-on-red ban. St. Louis invested $300 million in sustainable transport. Canadian leaders pushed for high car registration fees to fund transit. No single council member is named; instead, the review tracks national and local leaders’ actions. The article underscores that, despite new laws and investments, systemic danger remains. Streetsblog’s coverage centers the ongoing risks to pedestrians and cyclists, showing that progress is slow and incomplete.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
