Twenty-eight left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In just over three years, Staten Island CB1 has seen 5,339 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. In the last twelve months alone, four people died. Eleven more suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed in Westerleigh.</strong> The police said he suffered head trauma. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The story repeats itself. &ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>reported The Brooklyn Paper</a>.</p><p>On July 5th, a motorcyclist died on Bay Street. A car made a K-turn. The bike hit the door. The rider was rushed to the hospital. He did not make it. &ldquo;A motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>wrote amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—438 incidents, five deaths. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds, three more. Bikes: seven injuries, no deaths. The street is not neutral. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children crossing the street. Others block progress. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill that would have curbed repeat speeders—drivers who rack up violations and keep killing. The bill would have forced them to slow down. He said no. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act—or do not. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, reported by Streetsblog NYC, centers on New York’s offer of over $100 million for New Jersey Transit, potentially as an annual payment from congestion toll revenue. Hochul said, 'We've made multiple offers to settle this lawsuit. Very generous offers.' New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy refused, risking further strain on NJ Transit, which recently raised fares 15 percent. Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum called Murphy’s stance 'a stubbornness tax' paid by transit riders. Environmental advocates criticized Murphy for blocking improvements to public transportation. The congestion pricing program, set to be the nation’s first, remains tied up in court. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, now entering its last public feedback phase, will be reviewed by the MTA Board in early winter 2025 and implemented by late summer. The proposal includes over $30 million in new funding, 17 new local routes, and increased frequency for 17 lines, but also service reductions on 29 routes. The main highlight is the introduction of 'rush' routes to connect riders to rail faster. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'Every change to a route has an impact on the schedule... and we did it.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards voiced support, stating, 'I'm ready. We're ready.' The process began in 2019 and was shaped by extensive community input.

Hochul hid her public schedule for months when she killed congestion pricing. Repeated records requests hit a wall. Advocates and legal experts say the secrecy blocks vital scrutiny. New Yorkers are left in the dark as drivers keep clogging city streets.</p><p class=mb3>On December 16, 2024, Gov. Kathy Hochul's office refused to release her daily schedule for April, May, and June—the months when she halted congestion pricing. Streetsblog filed two Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests (R001199-062024 and R001389-102924), both denied or delayed without reason. The matter centers on the governor's decision to 'pause congestion pricing,' a move that impacts every New Yorker who walks, bikes, or rides transit. Heather Murray of Cornell Law School called the delay 'unconscionable,' saying, 'Delaying release of these records for six months is tantamount to denial of the request and violates the Freedom of Information Law.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance urged Hochul to 'level with New Yorkers.' The governor's secrecy shields her from accountability as city streets remain dangerous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season. The incident raises questions about internal discipline and the risks posed by impaired driving, even among law enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'A van veered into three parked sedans. A 6-year-old girl in the front seat took the hit. The airbag burst. Her head bled. She stayed awake. The driver was distracted.' The crash occurred at 12:59 p.m. The police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The young passenger, seated in the front, suffered severe head lacerations but remained conscious. The van's impact struck the parked vehicles, all unoccupied at the time. The report makes clear: driver distraction led to the collision and the child's injuries. No victim behavior is listed as a contributing factor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The fix is temporary. Cyclists and pedestrians face the same dangers. Advocates demand a highway lane for bikes. The city delays. The threat remains. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On December 13, 2024, officials announced the reopening of the Hudson River Greenway between W. 181st and Dyckman streets after months of repairs. The Parks Department said, 'While durable repairs have been made, efforts are ongoing to address underlying challenges and create a stronger, safer greenway for New Yorkers.' The path, north of the George Washington Bridge, has collapsed twice in two years. Advocates like Allegra LeGrande and Ira Gershenhorn, along with former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz, urge the city to convert a Henry Hudson Parkway lane into a protected bike path. They call this 'low-hanging fruit.' Instead, the city has forced cyclists onto dangerous, unprotected detours. The city’s refusal to provide a safe, direct route exposes vulnerable road users to ongoing harm. No council bill number applies; this is an urgent matter of infrastructure and safety, not legislation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On December 10, 2024, Manhattan Community Board 2’s transportation and parks committees reviewed Council Member Vickie Paladino’s proposal to ban e-bikes from city parks. The committees voted overwhelmingly against it. The matter, described as an effort to 'make it more harmonious and safer for people in parks,' was criticized as 'not fleshed out.' Paladino, a Queens Republican, failed to provide data or address existing rules. Co-sponsor Gale Brewer admitted she signed on under pressure and doubted enforcement. Committee members Shirley Secunda, Susanna Aaron, Janet Liff, and Jeannine Kiely all voiced strong opposition, calling the bill redundant and inadequate. The Central Park Conservancy declined to endorse a ban, urging more protected bike lanes instead. The board found the proposal did nothing for safety and ignored systemic issues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article recounts the case of Barbara Hutson, who suffered two broken arms after tripping over Christmas trees left on a Manhattan sidewalk by Regis High School and a neighboring coop. The article states: 'This would not have happened if Regis and the coop had not left the trees to occupy 70 percent of the sidewalk width,' quoting Hutson’s lawyer, Adam White. Hutson sued and won a $1.1 million jury verdict. The piece highlights city code requiring a clear pedestrian passage and criticizes the city’s lax enforcement. The article urges residents and government to keep sidewalks clear, placing discarded trees in the curbside lane, not where people walk. No council bill was involved, but the advocacy centers the danger to pedestrians and the need for systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
