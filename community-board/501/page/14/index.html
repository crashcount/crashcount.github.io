Brooklyn’s gap in bike safety remains wide.</p><p class=mb3>On January 9, 2025, Streetsblog NYC published an essay detailing a crash on Henry Street in Brooklyn. The piece, titled 'A Brush With Danger Made Me Exhibit A in My Fight for Better Bike Lanes in Brooklyn,' describes the lack of protected bike lanes in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. The author recounts merging into traffic, being closely followed by a driver, and crashing on a wet, greasy iron grid. The car sped away. Passersby helped. The cyclist suffered a broken collarbone. The essay notes, 'Our area of Brooklyn is a major hole in the borough's protected bike lane network.' Council Member Shahana Hanif attended a community meeting on the issue. The call is clear: Brooklyn’s streets favor cars, not people. The absence of protected lanes leaves cyclists exposed and injured.

The lawmakers, joined by Senators Steven Rhoads and Bill Weber, criticized Lieber for 'losing the trust of commuters' and downplaying subway crime. They condemned the new $9 congestion pricing toll for Midtown, with Weber calling it 'tone deaf' and demanding repeal. The event summary reads: 'GOP pols push MTA boss to resign after brushing off transit crime as New York braces for even more taxes, fees.' The lawmakers oppose further taxes and fees to close the MTA’s $33 billion gap. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

On January 6, 2025, Council Member Tony Simone announced a legislative push to require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years. The bill, still in proposal stage, will move through the relevant council committee. Simone’s proposal comes after a spate of subway violence, including a recent shove onto tracks in his district. The bill summary states: 'My legislation will require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years.' Simone urges the use of congestion pricing revenue for these safety upgrades, arguing, 'No priority is higher on any rider's mind, including mine, than safety on the system.' Simone is the primary sponsor. The measure aims to prevent fatal and dangerous falls and shoves, focusing on protecting riders from harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled "MTA eyes new taxes, fees to plug $33B budget hole — even after NYC’s $9 congestion toll!", landed in the spotlight after the new toll failed to close the gap. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, district 35, formally objected to the unfunded capital plan with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. Their joint letter blocked the plan’s January 1 start, forcing negotiations. Governor Hochul, who backs the $68 billion plan, promised no income tax hikes but left other taxes and fees on the table. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called for transparency. The MTA’s future—and the safety of those who rely on it—hangs in the balance.

Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead when the collision occurred at their left front bumpers. The driver of one sedan, an 18-year-old male, was cited for unsafe speed, a key contributing factor to the crash. The driver was wearing a lap belt and harness and sustained whiplash injuries. A 44-year-old male passenger in the other sedan also suffered whiplash and a head injury. Neither occupant was ejected from their vehicles. The report lists no contributing factors related to the victims. The crash demonstrates the dangers posed by excessive speed in multi-vehicle collisions, resulting in serious injuries to vehicle occupants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, 'A speeding sedan slammed an SUV mid-turn. Steel crumpled.' The impact left a 30-year-old male occupant with severe head lacerations; he remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor. The sedan was traveling straight ahead, while the SUV was turning, and the crash resulted in significant damage to both vehicles. The injured man was not wearing a seatbelt, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor to the crash itself. The focus remains on the excessive speed of the sedan, which led to the violent collision and serious injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Congestion pricing staggered forward. Pedestrian braking tech became law. Atlanta banned right-on-red. Cities poured millions into transit. Yet, the death toll from cars barely budged. Streets remain dangerous. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>This is a year-in-review, not a single bill, but it covers major 2024 policy actions. Streetsblog’s December 23, 2024 recap highlights the struggle to end car carnage. The piece notes, 'America's first-ever congestion pricing program had been paused at the 11th hour... brought back in November, though in a sadly diminished form.' USDOT approved a rule for automatic pedestrian emergency braking in new cars. Atlanta passed a right-on-red ban. St. Louis invested $300 million in sustainable transport. Canadian leaders pushed for high car registration fees to fund transit. No single council member is named; instead, the review tracks national and local leaders’ actions. The article underscores that, despite new laws and investments, systemic danger remains. Streetsblog’s coverage centers the ongoing risks to pedestrians and cyclists, showing that progress is slow and incomplete.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move comes weeks before new congestion tolls hit Manhattan. The matter, titled 'MTA plans fare hike as it OKs $1.27B train car purchase weeks before new congestion toll: ‘Keep the grift alive’,' drew fire from Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who called the fare and toll hikes a 'scam' and accused the MTA of mismanagement. Holden’s comments echo broader council criticism of the MTA’s spending and question the effectiveness of congestion pricing. MTA officials defend the investment, citing improved reliability and safety with the new R211 cars. No independent safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

Hochul said, 'We've made multiple offers to settle this lawsuit. Very generous offers.' New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy refused, risking further strain on NJ Transit, which recently raised fares 15 percent. Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum called Murphy’s stance 'a stubbornness tax' paid by transit riders. Environmental advocates criticized Murphy for blocking improvements to public transportation.
