His name was Nacere Ellis. He died from head trauma after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The driver stayed at the scene. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported</a> the NYPD is still investigating.</p><p>A week later, a 13-year-old boy on a moped collided with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. It was 1 a.m. He left the street in critical condition, a head injury sending him to Richmond University Medical Center. The bus driver and passengers walked away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7 wrote</a> nothing about what led up to the crash.

The numbers keep rising. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The dead and injured are not numbers. They are neighbors. In the last 12 months alone, 5 people died and 13 were seriously hurt. Children under 18 made up about one in eight of the injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>5 deaths and 3 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all left their mark. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The silence from local leaders is loud. Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to curb repeat speeders, a measure that could have forced the most dangerous drivers to slow down. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted no</a> even as the bodies piled up. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted <strong>yes</strong> to extend school speed zones, a small step for child safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>He did his part</a>.

The law hits the vulnerable hardest.

Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people first. The dead cannot speak.

Staff shortages and budget cuts choke progress. Riders wait. Commutes crawl. Promises break. The city’s most vulnerable—bus riders—are left stranded by inaction and empty pledges.</p><p class=mb3>The Streets Plan law, passed by the City Council in 2019, requires DOT to build 20 miles of new bus lanes in 2022 and 30 miles each year for the next four years. As of December 2022, DOT had built only 7.7 miles, with 4.2 miles of new camera-enforced lanes and 7.3 miles under construction. The agency cites staff shortages and budget cuts as the main obstacles. Council members and advocates, including Riders Alliance and the City Council, have condemned the delays and called staff shortages 'unacceptable.' Mayor Adams’s administration has revised its promise, now counting 'enhanced' lanes, not just new ones. DOT spokesman Vin Barone insists the agency intends to meet 2023 goals, but specifics are lacking. The law has no enforcement provision. The city’s one million daily bus riders, many low-income and people of color, continue to suffer slow, unreliable service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Systemic flaws persist. Riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On November 25, 2022, a public critique targeted the MTA’s Customers Count Survey. The survey, administered by WBA Research, asked riders to rate satisfaction with conditions like panhandling and homelessness, but gave no room for context. The matter summary states, 'the survey was flawed and would produce biased results.' The critique opposes the narrative that subway danger comes from vulnerable people, and warns that these results justify more police, not real safety. No council bill or committee is involved; this is a public challenge to MTA’s data practices. The author notes, 'the authority is failing to collect key data that it can use to actually improve people’s experience using transit.' Riders’ voices are lost. The system’s real dangers remain unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is led by Council Member Marjorie Velazquez, though she declined comment as the process continues. The matter, as described by the Regional Plan Association and partners, aims to 'enable merchants or organized groups to tap into the Open Restaurant program and its legal infrastructure, giving new mixed-use space to programs that benefit their communities.' The Alfresco NYC Coalition and advocates like Maulin Mehta support shifting oversight to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a broader, safer approach to curb use. The bill is under active debate, with hearings showing strong support for reclaiming curb space for public benefit, not just cars or restaurants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched. Council Member Erik Bottcher and local activists pushed for the redesign, citing high crash and fatality rates: 173 crashes this year, 40 injuries, and three pedestrian deaths since 2016. Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits.
