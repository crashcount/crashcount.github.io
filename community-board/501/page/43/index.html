Eight hundred thirty-four injured. Eleven left with wounds so grave they may never heal.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Staten Island CB1 over the past year. These are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><p>On July 5th, Jeremy Claudio, age 34, was riding his motorcycle on Bay Street. A Toyota SUV made a K-turn across traffic. Claudio hit the driver’s door. He died at the hospital. There were no arrests. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>Police said</a> the investigation continues. The street is quiet now, but the loss remains.</p><p>In May, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, tried to cross Targee Street. An e-scooter struck him. He died from his injuries. The driver was thrown from the scooter. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>Paramedics rushed both men to the hospital</a>. Only one came home.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed five people and injured over 400 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but injured several. Even bikes injured a handful. No mode is harmless, but the deadliest are the biggest, fastest, and least forgiving.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h2><p>Some leaders have acted. Council Member Kamillah Hanks voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop the real danger—drivers who do not yield. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The new law</a> says streets belong to people, not just cars.</p><p>But others have failed. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>against</strong> reauthorizing speed cameras in school zones. He also voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to redesign streets for safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>The record is clear</a>: some protect drivers’ convenience, not children’s lives.</p><h2 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h2><p><strong>The deaths will not stop until leaders act.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras, not fewer. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. Every day of delay is another family’s grief.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Komanoff, a longtime advocate for congestion pricing and carbon taxes, analyzes state motor fuel tax receipts from 2019 to 2022. He finds a 16 percent drop in fuel sales, with April 2022 showing a stark 40 percent decline compared to April 2019. The piece, titled 'High Gas Prices Are Reducing Driving!', challenges claims that Americans are immune to price signals. Komanoff writes, 'Pricing has power. Changes in the prices of goods and services affect demand for those items.' No council bill or vote is involved. The analysis underscores that fewer cars mean safer streets for vulnerable road users, though no formal safety assessment is provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project builds on the success of Covid-era open streets and seasonal closures. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, "DOT is proud to build on the success of our Open Streets with proposals to formalize spaces like the Doyers Open Street as a permanent pedestrian plaza." Wellington Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership, praised the move, calling it "healthier and safer for both shopkeepers and customers." The plan includes new plaza features and changes to nearby parking for commercial loading. The effort is part of a broader city push, with BIDs leading similar projects across New York. The conversion gives crowded Chinatown a rare, needed refuge for pedestrians and local businesses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states: 'New York State residents continued to drive heavily despite high gas prices, with fuel consumption increasing from March to May 2022.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance slams the tax holiday as 'an outrageous windfall for oil profiteers' and warns it deprives New Yorkers of essential services. The article ties increased driving to sprawl and transit neglect, noting, 'Decades of sprawl planning and disinvestment in transit has made it more difficult to get around without a car—at a cost of our lungs, our bodies and our planet.' The surge in driving means more road deaths, more congestion, and more pollution.

Construction may start this fall.</p><p class=mb3>On July 5, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a proposal to overhaul Underhill and Vanderbilt Avenues in Prospect Heights. The plan, described as a 'traffic network and public realm plan,' aims to convert Underhill Avenue into a bike boulevard and upgrade Vanderbilt Avenue with new bike lanes, pedestrian islands, and traffic-calming features. The proposal follows community workshops where residents demanded safer, people-first streets and dedicated loading zones. DOT will close the northern-most block of Underhill to cars, add two-way bike lanes, and install pinch-points to slow drivers. On Vanderbilt, sharrows become painted bike lanes, and new pedestrian islands and turn lanes will protect cyclists and walkers. DOT hopes to begin construction in the fall and is reviewing the neighborhood for further changes. Gib Veconi, a local advocate, said, 'The changes will help force drivers to slow down 24/7.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seven miles of danger for walkers and cyclists. Bus lanes, signals, and bold changes on the table. Community split. Businesses fear lost parking. Advocates push for safety. No fixes before 2023.</p><p class=mb3>On July 1, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) and MTA kicked off a public process to overhaul bus service and pedestrian safety along Brooklyn’s Flatbush Avenue. The project, part of the Streets Master Plan, faces committee review and community outreach through summer and fall, with implementation not expected before 2023. DOT Director of Bus Priority Kyle Gebhart said, “Everything is on the table.” The agency’s data shows slow buses and high rates of pedestrian and cyclist injuries. The plan divides the corridor into three segments for tailored solutions, including curbside and center-running bus lanes, transit signal priority, and busways. Some business groups voiced anger over possible parking loss, but transit advocates countered that most shoppers do not drive. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein said, “Busways are great for business, bringing more customers from more neighborhoods more efficiently and affordably.” The project’s outcome will shape safety for thousands who walk, bike, and ride.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
