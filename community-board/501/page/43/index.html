Twenty-eight left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In just over three years, Staten Island CB1 has seen 5,339 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. In the last twelve months alone, four people died. Eleven more suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed in Westerleigh.</strong> The police said he suffered head trauma. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The story repeats itself. &ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>reported The Brooklyn Paper</a>.</p><p>On July 5th, a motorcyclist died on Bay Street. A car made a K-turn. The bike hit the door. The rider was rushed to the hospital. He did not make it. &ldquo;A motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>wrote amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—438 incidents, five deaths. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds, three more. Bikes: seven injuries, no deaths. The street is not neutral. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children crossing the street. Others block progress. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill that would have curbed repeat speeders—drivers who rack up violations and keep killing. The bill would have forced them to slow down. He said no. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act—or do not. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Cameras alone are not enough.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, published December 14, 2022, reviews recommendations for automated enforcement programs. The study, titled "Four Ways To Build A Better Automated Enforcement Program," surveyed 1,500 U.S. adults about traffic cameras. Researchers, including Kelcie Ralph, urge cities to use data-driven camera placement, scale fines to income, and spend revenue on self-enforcing infrastructure like road narrowing. They warn against using cameras as cash cows or funding police and private contractors. The report states: "The purpose of [automated enforcement] is to improve safety, not catch unsuspecting drivers." Ralph adds, "They need to be in places with known safety risks, and it should be a data driven process." The analysis calls for shifting control to transportation departments and removing jail time for unpaid fines. These changes aim to protect vulnerable road users and make streets safer for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cameras miss them. Streets stay dangerous. Senator Gounardes pushes a bill to pay citizens for reporting illegal plates. Police claim action, but advocates see little change. The bill sits in committee. Ghost cars keep rolling.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill in 2022 to reward citizens who report illegal license plates. The bill remains in committee. The measure would give whistleblowers 25% of the ticket, up to $75. The matter targets drivers who obscure or remove plates to dodge automated enforcement. As city and state agencies rely more on cameras to catch speeders and red-light runners, more drivers hide their plates. The Department of Transportation says cameras failed to ticket over 4% of violators last fall, up from 1% in 2019. Advocates accuse police of lax enforcement and even breaking the law themselves. Gounardes’s bill, still stalled, aims to close this loophole and put power in the hands of citizens. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while enforcement lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, "Designing New York: Streetscapes for Wellness," urges a shift from car-centric planning to public spaces that serve people. The statement notes, "streets are arguably one of the city’s most readily accessed and underutilized public resources." The Commission, in collaboration with city agencies and advocacy groups, showcases case studies where open streets and community-driven design improved health and access. The report criticizes decades of planning that prioritized cars and blocked communities from vital spaces. It calls for equity, local engagement, and innovation in street design. No council member is named; this is a commission-led initiative. The statement supports reallocating street space and opposes car-first planning, pushing for a city where wellness and safety come first.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders get a safer, smoother crossing.</p><p class=mb3>"It was very important for people to have access to greenspace, especially during the pandemic this project will allow bikers to ride in ease and comfort, you no longer have to worry that you might slip off the bridge and fall into the river." -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On December 13, 2022, Council Member Julie Won (District 26) joined city officials to mark the completion of a DOT pilot project covering the Roosevelt Island Bridge bike lane. The project, coordinated with Council Member Julie Menin, used fiber-reinforced polymer panels to shield riders from the bridge’s hazardous metal grating. The official matter: 'Roosevelt Island Bridge bike lane now covered for a safer, smoother ride.' Won praised the project’s quick finish and its promise of safer, more comfortable biking. DOT and community leaders noted the new surface prevents slips and flats, separating cyclists from traffic. The $100,000 upgrade, never before used in New York, aims to keep vulnerable road users out of harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Staff shortages and budget cuts choke progress. Riders wait. Commutes crawl. Promises break. The city’s most vulnerable—bus riders—are left stranded by inaction and empty pledges.</p><p class=mb3>The Streets Plan law, passed by the City Council in 2019, requires DOT to build 20 miles of new bus lanes in 2022 and 30 miles each year for the next four years. As of December 2022, DOT had built only 7.7 miles, with 4.2 miles of new camera-enforced lanes and 7.3 miles under construction. The agency cites staff shortages and budget cuts as the main obstacles. Council members and advocates, including Riders Alliance and the City Council, have condemned the delays and called staff shortages 'unacceptable.' Mayor Adams’s administration has revised its promise, now counting 'enhanced' lanes, not just new ones. DOT spokesman Vin Barone insists the agency intends to meet 2023 goals, but specifics are lacking. The law has no enforcement provision. The city’s one million daily bus riders, many low-income and people of color, continue to suffer slow, unreliable service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states, 'the survey was flawed and would produce biased results.' The critique opposes the narrative that subway danger comes from vulnerable people, and warns that these results justify more police, not real safety. No council bill or committee is involved; this is a public challenge to MTA’s data practices.

The bill is led by Council Member Marjorie Velazquez, though she declined comment as the process continues. The matter, as described by the Regional Plan Association and partners, aims to 'enable merchants or organized groups to tap into the Open Restaurant program and its legal infrastructure, giving new mixed-use space to programs that benefit their communities.' The Alfresco NYC Coalition and advocates like Maulin Mehta support shifting oversight to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a broader, safer approach to curb use. The bill is under active debate, with hearings showing strong support for reclaiming curb space for public benefit, not just cars or restaurants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
