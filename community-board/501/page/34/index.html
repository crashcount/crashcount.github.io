Eight hundred thirty-four injured. Eleven left with wounds so grave they may never heal.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Staten Island CB1 over the past year. These are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><p>On July 5th, Jeremy Claudio, age 34, was riding his motorcycle on Bay Street. A Toyota SUV made a K-turn across traffic. Claudio hit the driver’s door. He died at the hospital. There were no arrests. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>Police said</a> the investigation continues. The street is quiet now, but the loss remains.</p><p>In May, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, tried to cross Targee Street. An e-scooter struck him. He died from his injuries. The driver was thrown from the scooter. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>Paramedics rushed both men to the hospital</a>. Only one came home.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed five people and injured over 400 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but injured several. Even bikes injured a handful. No mode is harmless, but the deadliest are the biggest, fastest, and least forgiving.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h2><p>Some leaders have acted. Council Member Kamillah Hanks voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop the real danger—drivers who do not yield. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The new law</a> says streets belong to people, not just cars.</p><p>But others have failed. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>against</strong> reauthorizing speed cameras in school zones. He also voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to redesign streets for safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>The record is clear</a>: some protect drivers’ convenience, not children’s lives.</p><h2 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h2><p><strong>The deaths will not stop until leaders act.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras, not fewer. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. Every day of delay is another family’s grief.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Jessica Ramos and colleagues sent a letter to city and state DOTs urging action against the 'demonization' of e-bikes and e-scooters. The letter, signed by Ramos and State Sen. Liz Krueger, demanded more education on safe riding and battery use, warning, 'We cannot allow a narrative to build against a vital, green, and growing mode of transportation.' Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries. The senators warned that inaction could lead to blanket bans, hitting delivery workers hardest. The city’s plan for safe charging hubs faces local opposition.

The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2023, a closed-door City Hall meeting gathered Brooklyn political figures to debate the future of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The event, organized by Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi, focused on whether to reduce the BQE from three lanes to two. Former Brooklyn Democratic Party Chair Frank Seddio opposed the lane reduction, urging allies to resist the change. The meeting excluded some officials who support shrinking the highway, such as Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, who cite environmental and community health concerns. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the city for favoring a three-lane solution and sidelining affected communities. City Hall denied taking a side, stating, 'the decision would be based on a DOT traffic study.' No formal council bill or vote was recorded, and no safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Governor Hochul’s 2023 state budget proposal, analyzed March 3, 2023, keeps New York State’s long-running refusal to match MTA funding under law 18-b. The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt. The budget leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as transit stagnates and car dominance persists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Most streets failed the vulnerable. The city’s patchwork snow plan left danger for all who walk or ride.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2023, Streetsblog NYC published a report on New York City’s first major snow of the year. The article, titled 'Eyes on the Street: The First (And Only?) Snow Report of the Year,' details how sidewalk snow clearance, left to property owners, forced bus riders into slush. Painted bike lanes became useless as drivers shoveled snow into them and plows avoided parked cars. The Department of Sanitation’s new narrow snowplows cleared some routes well, but the Parks Department left cycling paths impassable, showing 'no interest...to encourage cycling.' Only the Brooklyn Bridge bike path stood out, freshly swept and safe. No council bill or vote is attached, but the report exposes how city agencies’ uneven snow removal endangers pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation opposes the bill. The issue gained urgency after three pedestrians, including 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun, died in separate crashes over the weekend of February 19, 2023. One victim was killed at an intersection where parked cars blocked visibility and the ADA ramp. Another, Zabina Gafoor, was struck by an NYPD vehicle responding to an emergency. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city’s failure to implement proven safety measures, saying, 'Our city’s children deserve to grow up without the threat of traffic violence.' The bill remains pending. Critics say the city’s refusal to daylight intersections and hold drivers accountable continues to put lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article highlights the unchecked rise of ultra-fast shipping, noting, 'the fallout looks like a veritable armada of delivery trucks triple-parking in your neighborhoods.' The author supports regulation of rapid delivery, investment in transit, and use of micro-mobility for last-mile trips. Council bill number and committee details are not applicable, as this is not a legislative action but a policy proposal. The piece argues that a delivery tax would push consumers toward sustainable choices and fund shared infrastructure, especially transit. It stresses that unchecked delivery harms vulnerable communities with pollution and congestion, and urges cities to prioritize curb management, electric trucks, and e-cargo bikes to protect public space and safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s most exposed remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On February 2, 2023, the Mayor’s Management Report confirmed failures by the Department of Transportation to meet required bus and bike lane mileage, echoing earlier Streetsblog reporting. The report covers July through October 2022 and cites 'fewer contractors available, shortages in installation materials, and general political opposition' as reasons for a 42% drop in bike lane miles and a 47% drop in bus lane miles compared to the previous year. Streetsblog’s coverage, criticized by City Hall and DOT, revealed that vacancies and political interference—especially from Council Members Bob Holden and Oswald Feliz—stalled projects like the Citi Bike expansion in Queens and the Fordham Road bus lane in the Bronx. DOT completed only 67% of its bus lane mandate and fell 17% short on bike lanes. The city’s own numbers now confirm what advocates warned: delays and obstruction put vulnerable road users in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to amend city law to require the Department of Transportation to finish all street resurfacing work within two weeks. If more time was needed, the department would have to notify the community, stating the reason and new timeline. The matter summary reads: 'ensure that all work associated with the resurfacing of any street is finalized within 2 weeks from the start of work.' Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by thirty other members. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst reviewed the impact, but torn-up streets are a known threat to pedestrians and cyclists. The bill is dead.

The hearing, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, questioned whether Mayor Adams is honoring his pledge to end road violence. The matter focused on the administration’s failure to meet Council-mandated benchmarks in the NYC Streets Plan, especially protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers stated, 'No New Yorker should have to fear for their life while crossing or using our streets.' She stressed that enforcement alone is not enough, demanding equitable infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods. Advocacy leaders like Elizabeth Adams and Sara Lind echoed the call for physical changes and accountability. The hearing marked a rare moment of scrutiny, with advocates welcoming the Council’s push for real safety measures for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
