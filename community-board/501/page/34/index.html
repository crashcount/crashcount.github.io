An e-scooter hit him. He died in the hospital. The driver was thrown from the scooter. No arrests. No answers. Police could not confirm the speed or direction of the e-scooter at the time of the collision (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>AMNY report</a>). The street stayed open. The blood washed away. The danger did not.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> on Staten Island CB1 streets. <strong>Nine more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Seven of the dead or gravely hurt were over 55. Children were not spared: <strong>93 kids were injured</strong> in crashes in the last year. The numbers do not rest. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=streets-that-do-not-forgive>Streets That Do Not Forgive</h2><p>Most deaths came from cars and SUVs. <strong>Sedans killed two. SUVs killed three.</strong> Trucks, buses, and vans took more. Bikes and mopeds left their own scars. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise. A man in a crosswalk on Forest Avenue was hit by an SUV. He died. The driver failed to yield. He never stood a chance (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Police cars crash too. In March, two officers swerved to avoid a U-turn and slammed into a restaurant. &ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>witness account</a>) said a witness. The officers lived. Next time, it could be a child on the sidewalk.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; But the speed limit on most streets is still 25 mph. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower it to 20 mph. They have not done it. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city calls for more enforcement. The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The hearing, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, questioned whether Mayor Adams is honoring his pledge to end road violence. The matter focused on the administration’s failure to meet Council-mandated benchmarks in the NYC Streets Plan, especially protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers stated, 'No New Yorker should have to fear for their life while crossing or using our streets.' She stressed that enforcement alone is not enough, demanding equitable infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods. Advocacy leaders like Elizabeth Adams and Sara Lind echoed the call for physical changes and accountability. The hearing marked a rare moment of scrutiny, with advocates welcoming the Council’s push for real safety measures for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One operator, Tonya Abernathy, says, 'As a female it’s harder, because some passengers treat you differently because you’re a woman.' Thejoal Hope adds, 'You get a lot of disrespect, and you got to learn how to deal with that.' The piece calls for better training, pay equity, and supportive management.

The analysis highlights that New York, despite its vast rail network, has not expanded heavy rail since 1950 and has no major projects funded or under construction. In contrast, cities like Toronto and Seattle are building out their systems. The lack of transit growth leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as safe, reliable alternatives to car travel stagnate.

The project, begun in September 2021 and finished last fall, added 1,285 square feet of sidewalk, a new median, and red bus-only lanes on Westchester Avenue. The DOT worked with the MTA to cut a circuitous bus detour, giving Bx12 and other riders a direct path. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'DOT’s work at Pelham Bay Park... may be only one-10th of a mile, but the impact for thousands of riders will be gigantic.' New York City Transit President Richard Davey added, 'Bus lanes don't have to be miles long to deliver a huge impact.' The changes serve 64,000 daily riders, expanding space for pedestrians and shortening bus trips. More crosswalks now connect the busy transfer point, making the area less hostile for those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law, named after Carlos Moncayo, aims to curb a surge in construction worker deaths—22 in the past year, the highest in five years. State Sen.

Ramos and other lawmakers supported the bill, but advocates and union officials warn that without strong enforcement and education for new arrivals, deaths and injuries will persist.

The article centers on Ian Lockwood, a sustainable transportation expert, who was hit by a truck towing a boat while cycling. Lockwood blames road markings, not the driver, saying, 'I blame it on that yellow line.' He criticizes the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for prioritizing speed over safety, stating, 'They're there to make them faster.' Lockwood argues that traffic controls shift blame onto vulnerable users and do not guarantee safety. He supports Vision Zero and shared space designs, which slow traffic and reduce crashes. The critique calls for fewer big arterials and less reliance on signage, focusing instead on eliminating dangerous road features.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council members and advocates, including Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein, criticized the administration’s slow pace and lack of urgency. Bus riders like Holly and Frank voiced frustration at stagnant speeds and unmet promises. The Council has not set consequences for missing the requirement.

Hundreds called for car-free space, protected bike lanes, and safer crossings. The plaza’s chaotic traffic traps pedestrians. The city’s paint-and-plastic fixes have failed. Residents demand bold change. The city must listen.</p><p class=mb3>On December 30, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) released survey results on the future of Grand Army Plaza. The public consultation, held in November, drew 1,270 in-person responses. The DOT summarized: 'the majority of respondents were interested in options to unify the public spaces.' Council members are not directly named, but city officials like Terra Ishee, DOT Pedestrian Unit Director, acknowledged the limits of past efforts: 'We really need to bump it up and make it a full blown capital project.' Brooklyn organizer Kathy Park-Price of Transportation Alternatives said, 'After decades of car-centric planning, it's time to return Grand Army Plaza to people.' Residents’ top demands: more protected pedestrian space, protected bike lanes, and overhauled traffic operations. The DOT plans a capital project design in fall 2023. The survey shows clear public support for bold, systemic safety improvements for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, involved a 70-year-old man who died and a critically injured passenger. Witnesses described the SUV smashing through a concrete barrier and fence before falling onto the tracks, estimating speeds of 30 to 40 miles per hour. The NYPD initially suggested a 'medical episode' but later dropped this claim, despite a pattern of police blaming unexplained crashes on health issues. The vehicle’s license plate had 13 speeding violations since 2019, including four in the past year. No council bill or committee action is attached to this event. The case highlights systemic failures: weak enforcement against repeat reckless drivers, barriers that fail to protect, and police narratives that obscure driver responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
