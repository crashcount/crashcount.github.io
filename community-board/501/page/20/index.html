Five killed, 170 injured in five years. Councilwoman Julie Won backs the plan. Truckers and owners protest. DOT pushes forward. Streets stay deadly. Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The controversy centers on a planned bike lane in Queens’ District 26, championed by Councilwoman Julie Won. The city aims to connect the Pulaski and Kosciuszko bridges via Borden, Starr, and Review avenues. The project, requested by local civic groups and the community board, follows five deaths—including two cyclists—and over 170 injuries on these roads in five years. Won stated, 'We need to do everything we can to ensure we don’t lose another life to a preventable death.' Thirty-two business owners petitioned DOT to halt the project, citing truck maneuvering dangers. DOT representative Vincent Barone called the route 'a critical gap' in the bike network and promised 'much-needed safety improvements.' The plan will take up to 15 feet from Review Avenue for a two-way bike path and buffer, leaving 22 feet for traffic. The fight underscores the city’s struggle to protect vulnerable road users in truck-heavy corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA lost billions. Subway and bus riders face crumbling service. Republicans claim victory. Democrats gain nothing. The city’s lifeline bleeds. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price while drivers dodge the toll.</p><p class=mb3>On June 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul unilaterally paused New York’s congestion pricing law, first enacted in 2019 to fund the MTA’s $55 billion capital plan. The move slashed $15 billion from transit budgets, threatening repairs and upgrades. Hochul claimed to act for cost-of-living relief, but polling shows her approval at a record low. Republicans seized credit for the pause, while Democrats saw no political gain. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called it sabotage: 'Governor Kathy Hochul took a gamble when she sabotaged our public transit system for political gain and she lost dearly.' The MTA now faces a $33 billion shortfall for its next plan. No new revenue source is in place. The legislature, as Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany notes, already did its job by passing the law. The pause leaves transit riders stranded, while car traffic and systemic danger persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders lose lifelines. Streets fill with cars. Congestion rises. Pedestrians and cyclists face more danger. New York’s MTA repair plans gutted after congestion pricing dies. Leaders stall. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published September 20, 2024, details a wave of transit funding crises nationwide, with New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) at the center. The article, titled '‘Doom Loop’ Alert: Transit Systems are Suffering — And Too Many Are Cutting Service,' chronicles how pandemic relief funds are running dry, ridership lags, and costs soar. Governor Kathy Hochul killed congestion pricing, stripping the MTA of $1 billion a year. Now, the agency slashes repair programs. Streetsblog quotes transit leaders warning that service cuts mean crowded buses, more cars, and lost productivity. Council members and mayors in cities like Miami and Philadelphia face similar choices. The story makes clear: when transit fails, vulnerable road users—those who walk, bike, or rely on buses—face greater risk. The systemic danger grows as public transportation falters and streets fill with traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report singles out New York: 'where congestion pricing was paused, stands out as the urban core with the biggest increase in both congestion and VMT among the top 25.' Governor Hochul’s decision to halt congestion pricing drew sharp criticism from advocates. Sara Lind, Co-Executive Director of Open Plans, called the move 'disastrous,' warning that abandoning congestion pricing is a 'dereliction of duty' on street safety. The report blames city inaction on bus and bike lanes for worsening gridlock. As driving surges, vulnerable road users face greater risk.

Since then, city agencies have passed responsibility back and forth. The Parks Department, now tasked with care, cites budget cuts and overworked staff. Mayor Adams slashed $20 million from the Parks budget, worsening the crisis. Katherine Walsh, Community Board 7 Transportation Committee chair, calls the neglect an equity issue, highlighting Sunset Park’s high pollution and health risks. Brian Hedden of the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative urges a citywide fix. The matter title: 'Dead Trees Highlight Multiple City Failures on Sunset Park Greenway.' No council bill number or formal vote is attached, but the story exposes systemic failure and its toll on vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The action responds to Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause on congestion pricing, which threatens $2 billion in elevator projects at 23 stations. Organizers cite the MTA’s legal mandate to make 95 percent of the subway accessible by 2055 and warn of a 30 percent cut to ADA spending without congestion pricing funds. Jeff Peters of the Center for Independence of the Disabled NY said, 'Congestion pricing would be used for just this situation.' Danna Dennis of Riders Alliance and Jessica Murray of Elevator Action Group joined calls for action. The protest highlights the direct link between transit funding and safe, accessible passage for all New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city adds more car-free zones for kids. Streets once deadly will now be safer for walking, play, and learning. The move targets neighborhoods hit hardest by crashes.</p><p class=mb3>On August 29, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a record 71 school streets will close to cars this fall. The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Paint and ticket blitzes failed. Bus speeds barely moved. Riders remain stuck in traffic. Cars clog lanes. Promised fixes scrapped. Advocates demand real action. The city stalls. Riders suffer.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2024, MTA officials sent a scathing letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, criticizing the city’s decision to abandon plans to upgrade Fordham Road’s curbside bus lanes to offset bus lanes. The letter, signed by outgoing NYCT President Richard Davey and interim successor Demetrius Crichlow, called the city’s paint-and-enforcement approach a 'total bust.' The MTA cited new data showing bus speeds increased just 2–4 percent since October 2022—far below the 15 percent target. The matter summary reads: 'The Fordham Road project enjoys widespread support from transit advocacy groups, and Fordham Road bus riders, who have been enduring slow service for decades.' Council involvement is not specified, but the MTA’s letter and Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein both demand stronger measures. The city’s inaction leaves Bronx bus riders stranded in slow traffic, with vulnerable road users paying the price for political compromise.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
