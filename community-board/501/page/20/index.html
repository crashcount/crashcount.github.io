His name was Nacere Ellis. He died from head trauma after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The driver stayed at the scene. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported</a> the NYPD is still investigating.</p><p>A week later, a 13-year-old boy on a moped collided with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. It was 1 a.m. He left the street in critical condition, a head injury sending him to Richmond University Medical Center. The bus driver and passengers walked away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7 wrote</a> nothing about what led up to the crash.

The numbers keep rising. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The dead and injured are not numbers. They are neighbors. In the last 12 months alone, 5 people died and 13 were seriously hurt. Children under 18 made up about one in eight of the injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>5 deaths and 3 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all left their mark. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The silence from local leaders is loud. Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to curb repeat speeders, a measure that could have forced the most dangerous drivers to slow down. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted no</a> even as the bodies piled up. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted <strong>yes</strong> to extend school speed zones, a small step for child safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>He did his part</a>.

The law hits the vulnerable hardest.

Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people first. The dead cannot speak.

Vulnerable road users get a win.</p><p class=mb3>On October 2, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a policy reversal on McGuinness Boulevard. The original lane reduction and protected bike lane plan, previously scrapped, will now move forward for the southern half of the street, between Calyer Street and Meeker Avenue. The matter, described as a return to 'the road diet it had previously finalized and then rejected,' follows months of community outcry and advocacy. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and other local officials celebrated the move, crediting the Make McGuinness Safe coalition for relentless pressure. Restler stated, 'this is a decision that enhances safety in our community, and that's what matters.' The northern half of the boulevard remains unchanged, with two traffic lanes and barrier-protected bike lanes. The city’s action signals a renewed commitment to street safety after repeated delays and political interference.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The initiative, described as 'an absolute game-changer' by Martin Johnson of 67 Gourmet, boosts business and draws crowds on foot. Irene Kalogrias of Celso de Lemos says, 'Open street days are the busiest days for our store.' Vinni Schroeder of J.Jill urges expansion. Despite a lawsuit from some residents, business owners support the program. The matter, titled 'Tables of Success: Columbus Ave. Businesses Love the Open Street,' highlights how car-free streets bring safety and commerce. No formal council bill or vote is noted.

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

The plan, described as 'the biggest in the MTA's history,' now awaits review by a panel with appointees from the governor, legislative leaders, and the NYC mayor. Andrea Stewart-Cousins is mentioned in connection with the event. MTA Chair Janno Lieber stressed the plan's aim to 'protect riders from a decline in service due to infrastructure that’s been...neglected or left unfixed.' Governor Kathy Hochul pledged to 'fight to secure as much funding as possible.' The MTA expects $14 billion from the federal government, $8 billion from Albany and the city, and $13 billion from its own debt, leaving a $33 billion gap for the state to fill.

The city aims to connect the Pulaski and Kosciuszko bridges via Borden, Starr, and Review avenues. The project, requested by local civic groups and the community board, follows five deaths—including two cyclists—and over 170 injuries on these roads in five years. Won stated, 'We need to do everything we can to ensure we don’t lose another life to a preventable death.' Thirty-two business owners petitioned DOT to halt the project, citing truck maneuvering dangers. DOT representative Vincent Barone called the route 'a critical gap' in the bike network and promised 'much-needed safety improvements.' The plan will take up to 15 feet from Review Avenue for a two-way bike path and buffer, leaving 22 feet for traffic. The fight underscores the city’s struggle to protect vulnerable road users in truck-heavy corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move slashed $15 billion from transit budgets, threatening repairs and upgrades. Hochul claimed to act for cost-of-living relief, but polling shows her approval at a record low. Republicans seized credit for the pause, while Democrats saw no political gain. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called it sabotage: 'Governor Kathy Hochul took a gamble when she sabotaged our public transit system for political gain and she lost dearly.' The MTA now faces a $33 billion shortfall for its next plan. No new revenue source is in place. The legislature, as Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany notes, already did its job by passing the law. The pause leaves transit riders stranded, while car traffic and systemic danger persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published September 20, 2024, details a wave of transit funding crises nationwide, with New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) at the center. The article, titled '‘Doom Loop’ Alert: Transit Systems are Suffering — And Too Many Are Cutting Service,' chronicles how pandemic relief funds are running dry, ridership lags, and costs soar. Governor Kathy Hochul killed congestion pricing, stripping the MTA of $1 billion a year. Now, the agency slashes repair programs. Streetsblog quotes transit leaders warning that service cuts mean crowded buses, more cars, and lost productivity. Council members and mayors in cities like Miami and Philadelphia face similar choices. The story makes clear: when transit fails, vulnerable road users—those who walk, bike, or rely on buses—face greater risk. The systemic danger grows as public transportation falters and streets fill with traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
