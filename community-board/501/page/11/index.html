A woman in a Toyota. Bay Street, July 5. The car makes a K-turn. The motorcycle hits the door. <strong>Jeremy Claudio, 34, dies at the hospital.</strong> The driver walks away. No arrest. The city moves on. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>amNY called it</a> a collision during the holiday weekend. The police said the driver was &ldquo;making a K-turn from the northbound lane&mldr; into its southbound lane when the collision occurred.&rdquo; The investigation drags on.</p><p>Just days before, a teenager on an e-scooter was killed in Westerleigh. <strong>Nacere Ellis, 16, suffered head trauma.</strong> The driver stayed. The boy did not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper wrote</a>: &ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo; No charges.

Twenty-eight seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, Staten Island CB1 has seen 5,326 crashes. <strong>Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left bodies broken.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists are the first to bleed. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted yes to extend school speed zones, &ldquo;improving child pedestrian safety&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). Others do less. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to curb repeat reckless drivers (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). <strong>The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</strong></p><p>A DOT worker was slashed by an e-bike rider downtown. The agency called it &ldquo;an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>amNY</a>). The worker survived. The city shrugs.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more>The Call: Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who refuse to act. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be carved into stone.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Hochul faces pressure to let New York City charge for residential street parking. The plan targets illegal registrations, raises MTA funds, and could cut traffic. Critics say current rules reward fraud and endanger cyclists. Reform means fewer cars, safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 20, 2025, an editorial published by Streetsblog NYC called for Governor Hochul and state leaders to grant New York City the authority to create citywide, resident-only parking zones. The piece, titled 'Gov. Hochul Could Transform Our City with Parking Reform,' argues, 'With permission from the state, New York City could enact a citywide, resident-only parking system. Non-residents needn’t be banned from parking here, just charged for it, with the money going to the MTA.' The editorial highlights rampant illegal vehicle registrations and the dangers they pose, including uninsured cars and increased risk for cyclists. The proposal urges charging both residents and visitors for parking, with higher rates in dense, wealthy areas. The plan aims to reduce congestion, generate MTA revenue, and reclaim curb space for safer uses. No council member is directly named, as this is an opinion piece, but the call is clear: state action is needed to protect vulnerable road users and restore trust in public space management.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Tickets soared. Bus speeds rose. Crashes fell. Cameras now outpace NYPD enforcement. Repeat offenders dodge deterrence. Advocates push for tougher penalties. Streets clear, but danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On February 13, 2025, the MTA reported results from its Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) expansion, which began in August 2024. The program, described as 'bus-mounted camera tickets to drivers who double-park along bus routes or park in bus stops,' has issued over 400,000 tickets in five months. The ACE system grew from 623 buses on 14 routes to 1,000 buses on 34 routes by November. MTA spokesperson Laura Cala-Rauch said the program 'is having a big impact on speeding buses and improving the quality of life for New Yorkers.' Data from Jehiah Czebotar shows cameras now issue 76.4% of bus lane and stop tickets—93% by December. Bus speeds rose 5%, crashes involving buses dropped 20%, and emissions fell up to 10%. Persistent violators remain, with some drivers racking up five tickets. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called for escalating fines and legislative changes to target repeat offenders. The ACE program marks a shift toward automated, consistent enforcement, but loopholes for chronic blockers persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would cut the required minimum personal injury protection insurance for yellow cabs, liveries, and app-based drivers from $200,000 to $50,000. At a recent hearing, Lauren Pine, a nurse and crash survivor, testified: 'The minimum $50,000 no fault insurance was exhausted within the first week or so of my hospitalization.' Pine urged the Council to oppose the bill, warning that victims of traffic violence would be left financially devastated. Transportation Alternatives’ Ben Furnas also opposed the bill, stating, 'This legislation will ultimately make it more expensive and difficult to access care, treatment, and support after a traffic crash.' The bill is generating support among some council members, but advocates and survivors demand the Council maintain current coverage to protect crash victims.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Governor Hochul put the bill on hold. The editorial backs congestion pricing but slams the move to silence 800,000 New Yorkers. Power games, real stakes.</p><p class=mb3>On February 12, 2025, an editorial targeted a special election bill pushed by State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. The bill, introduced late Friday, would let Governor Hochul delay a congressional special election until November 4, leaving nearly 800,000 upstate residents without representation. The editorial quotes, 'wiping out congressional representation for so many people for so long is unfair and undemocratic and unconstitutional.' Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key player. Hochul requested the bill be put on hold, pausing the plan. The editorial supports congestion pricing, noting it has 'successfully reduced Midtown and Downtown traffic,' but condemns using democracy as a bargaining chip. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users is assessed, but the piece underscores the importance of congestion pricing for safer, less crowded streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Promised bus lanes never come. Mayor Adams broke his pledge. The city built just 9.6 miles in two years. Riders wait. DOT blames funding. Council law ignored. Streets stay deadly. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, released February 7, 2025, by the Independent Budget Office, exposes the city’s failure to meet the Streets Master Plan law (passed in 2019) mandating 150 miles of new bus lanes. The IBO states: 'It will be virtually impossible for the city to meet the City Council's required 150 miles of new bus lanes at the pace Mayor Adams is going.' Mayor Adams, who took office in 2022, has slowed or killed key bus projects, including the Fordham Road busway. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno claims the agency is building protected lanes and using cameras for enforcement, but admits resources are tight. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has called for compliance but not funded it. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein blames hiring freezes and political interference for 'broken promises and neglected legislation.' The report shows that while DOT’s budget grew, staffing for bus lane expansion fell. Bus speeds remain stuck at 8.1 mph. The city’s inaction leaves millions of bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—stranded and exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate included calls for audits and cost reductions from Rep. Mike Lawler, while MTA Chair Janno Lieber promised to prioritize repairs over expansion. The committee has not yet voted.
