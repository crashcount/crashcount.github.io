He survived with a bruised leg, awake at the scene. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>This Week</p><ul><li>Aug 29 — A driver injured a pedestrian in Staten Island CB1. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></li><li>Aug 29 — An unlicensed BMW driver hit a parked Chevy on Richmond Ave at Vedder Ave; the 33‑year‑old BMW driver was hurt. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></li><li>Aug 23 — At Brook St and Westervelt Ave, a sedan collided with an 11‑year‑old on a bike; the child was ejected and injured. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></li><li>Aug 23 — A 26‑year‑old pedestrian was hit near Richmond Ter; the driver was listed as inattentive. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></li></ul><p>The Pattern Is Written In Blood</p><p>Since Jan 1, 2022, Staten Island Community Board 1 has seen <strong>18 people killed and 2,902 injured</strong> in 5,764 crashes. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians bear the brunt: <strong>8 killed and 539 injured</strong>. People on bikes: <strong>1 killed and 146 injured</strong>.

Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella put it plainly about botched bus‑lane hours: “That’s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane in order to make a right‑hand turn.” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>amNY</a></p><p>Where It Breaks, How To Fix It</p><ul><li>Daylight the corners on Forest Ave and Jewett Ave. Protect the crosswalks with concrete.

The Senate bill to require <strong>intelligent speed assistance for repeated speed violators</strong> moved this session; on June 12, 2025, State Senator <strong>Andrew Lanza</strong> (SD 24) voted no. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a></p><p>Another lever is speed itself.

Assembly Member <strong>Charles Fall</strong> (AD 61) voted yes to extend school speed zones this June. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a></p><p>Forest Ave will still be there tomorrow. So will the crosswalk at Raymond Pl. The child on St Marys Ave survived. The next one might not.

They say New York carries the nation’s riders but gets shortchanged. Without funds, transit projects stall. Riders—millions—hang in the balance. The plea is blunt. The stakes are high.</p><p class=mb3>On March 25, 2025, State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, with Governor Kathy Hochul and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, sent a letter to President Trump and federal officials. They called for increased federal funding for the MTA’s $68.4 billion capital plan, citing that New York’s transit system carries 43% of U.S. riders but receives only 17% of federal formula funds. The letter urges, 'Mass transit must be federally funded at a level commensurate to its importance.' Stewart-Cousins, mentioned as a key signatory, previously rejected the capital plan due to a $35 billion shortfall. The group asks for $14 billion in federal support, up from $13 billion in the last plan. The MTA warns that without this funding, critical infrastructure—power, signaling, accessibility—remains at risk. The request is urgent. The city’s transit future depends on it.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Citizens Budget Commission urges deep cuts, fare hikes, and more city and state cash. Expansion projects like the Interborough Express may die. Riders risk worse service if lawmakers stall. The clock ticks.</p><p class=mb3>On March 21, 2025, the Citizens Budget Commission (CBC) released a warning about the MTA’s $33.4-billion capital budget gap for 2025–2029. The CBC recommends slashing $17 billion, scrapping expansion plans like the Interborough Express, and boosting city and state contributions by $9 billion. The CBC calls for a 6 percent hike in fares, tolls, and vehicle fees—higher than the planned 4 percent. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said tax hikes are on the table. Governor Hochul’s office backs a payroll tax hike, but the CBC wants it regionalized. The CBC’s Andrew Rein said, “We have to prioritize state-of-good-repair, basic modernization, and delay some of the system expansions.” The report warns that failing to fund maintenance will gut service, repeating past crises. No direct safety analysis was provided, but cuts threaten transit reliability for millions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooklyn’s first Regional Slow Zone targets crowded streets. Ten severe injuries and one death in five years haunt the area. Council Member Restler and DOT push for slower traffic. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2025, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced the lowering of Dumbo’s speed limit to 20 mph, making it Brooklyn’s first Regional Slow Zone. The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law sits ignored. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>"Pearlstein said that the mayor has spent four years coming up with various reasons not to do one project after another when he should have been supporting his agency in the face of expected opposition. As a result, it's difficult to give Hizzoner a pass for falling short." -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2025, the Department of Transportation released its annual report on the 2019 Streets Master Plan law. The report, required by the City Council, reveals the city missed mandates for protected bike lanes (29.3 of 50 miles) and bus lanes (17.9 of 30 miles) for the third year running. The matter summary states: 'New York City has failed to meet legally required benchmarks for redesigning streets for bikes, buses, and pedestrians due to a lack of resources and political interference.' Mayor Eric Adams is named as the main obstacle. The report cites staff shortages, shrinking divisions, and political pushback—especially the mayor’s role in killing the Fordham Road busway. Former DOT commissioner Polly Trottenberg warned the plan needed more funding and a new approach. Advocates and officials say Adams’s lack of support left the city’s most vulnerable road users exposed. The law’s promise is broken. The streets stay deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
