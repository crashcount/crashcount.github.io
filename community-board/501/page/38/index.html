Bay St, Clove Rd, and Victory Blvd add dozens more injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Failing To Yield, Turning Into Flesh</p><p>Failure to yield shows up again and again in pedestrian harm here, including a fatal left‑turn on Forest Ave at Raymond Pl that killed a 68‑year‑old in a crosswalk on Jan 6, 2025. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Drivers blowing past signals also killed and maimed; “disregarded traffic control” is tied to multiple deaths in the local record. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On Hylan Boulevard, even the signs sow confusion. Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella put it plainly about botched bus‑lane hours: “That’s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane in order to make a right‑hand turn.” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>amNY</a></p><p>Where It Breaks, How To Fix It</p><ul><li>Daylight the corners on Forest Ave and Jewett Ave. Protect the crosswalks with concrete.

The Senate bill to require <strong>intelligent speed assistance for repeated speed violators</strong> moved this session; on June 12, 2025, State Senator <strong>Andrew Lanza</strong> (SD 24) voted no. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a></p><p>Another lever is speed itself. New Yorkers have the means to press for lower default speeds citywide and to rein in repeat speeders. The steps are laid out here. <a href=/take_action/>/take_action/</a></p><p>Local officials know the stakes. Assembly Member <strong>Charles Fall</strong> (AD 61) voted yes to extend school speed zones this June. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a></p><p>Forest Ave will still be there tomorrow.

Pandemic gutted ridership and revenue. Federal law blocks agencies from using funds for daily operations. Cuts loom: fewer trains, fewer buses, more danger for those who walk and ride. Labor calls Congress to act. Streets will pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On May 24, 2023, Greg Regan, president of the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO, published an urgent call for federal action. The piece, titled 'Feds Must Give Transit the Support (And Flexibility) It Needs Right Now,' demands Congress let transit agencies use federal funds for operating costs, not just capital projects. Regan warns, 'This flaw in federal policy is squeezing communities around the country.' He highlights looming service cuts in cities like New York, Boston, and Atlanta. Regan opposes current restrictions and supports permanent change. The opinion, published in Streetsblog NYC, reflects labor’s stance: without operational funding, transit shrinks, and vulnerable riders—those who walk, bike, or rely on buses and trains—face greater risk. No council bill number or committee applies; this is a national advocacy push.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) latest redesign proposal for Ninth Street in Gowanus drew fire at a Community Board 6 meeting. The plan, discussed in the Transportation and Public Safety Committees, adds buffer-protected bike lanes and some jersey barriers, but skips driveways and omits pedestrian islands, raised intersections, and bicycle signals. Maxime Le Munier, whose wife Sarah Schick was killed by a truck driver on Ninth Street, said, “What we want is to guarantee everyone’s safety, and it seems like it’s going to fall short.” Community Board 6 Transportation Chair Doug Gordon and Public Safety Chair Jerry Armer echoed calls for stronger, faster action. Council Member Hanif hosted a recent event on the issue. The committees unanimously approved the DOT proposal with conditions: more pedestrian safety, more traffic calming, and a comprehensive plan for all of Ninth Street. DOT has not set a timeline.

Cyclists still face danger. Parks closed the path but failed to set a safe detour. Riders dodge cars, confusion, and construction. The city drags its feet.</p><p class=mb3>The Ocean Parkway bike lane repair project, funded in 2019 by then-Borough President Eric Adams and former Council Member Mark Treyger, finally began in May 2023 after years of delays. The $2.6-million, seven-block overhaul—managed by the Parks Department—targets the cracked 1894 path between avenues R and X. Construction, delayed by the pandemic and contract issues, will continue through March 2024. The Parks Department closed the northernmost block but failed to provide a safe, legal detour for cyclists, leaving them to navigate dangerous service roads and unclear signage. Treyger celebrated the start on social media, thanking advocates. Jon Orcutt of Bike New York criticized Parks for slow, unsafe detour practices, saying, 'They should be working on it based on function.' Lawmakers have introduced legislation to speed up Parks capital projects. Cyclists remain at risk until the city fixes its broken process.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, starting fall 2023 in West Harlem, covers up to 10 residential blocks and 14 public schools. The DSNY report, with McKinsey input, finds containerization viable for most neighborhoods. The matter aims to 'remove garbage bags from sidewalks' and address public health. Council member Shaun Abreu supports the initiative, calling current practices 'backwards' and endorsing large-scale containerization. Advocates like CHEKPEDS founder Christine Berthet support repurposing parking for trash containers, citing sidewalk access. The city will double trash collection in the pilot area, with $5.7 million allocated.

He says it could break the political deadlock. The plan keeps most benefits: less traffic, faster buses, more transit cash. Regular drivers would pay more. Occasional drivers get a break.</p><p class=mb3>On April 26, 2023, Charles Komanoff proposed a policy tweak to New York’s stalled congestion pricing plan. The plan, passed by the state legislature in 2019, remains stuck in federal review. Komanoff suggests, 'let’s give every household in the 12-county MTA region a single untolled trip per month into the congestion zone.' He argues this would address fairness concerns and soften opposition from occasional drivers. The freebie would cut annual net revenues by $110 million, but Komanoff says this could be offset by raising tolls for regular commuters. The proposal aims to preserve congestion pricing’s core goals: less traffic, faster travel, and more funding for transit. Komanoff’s compromise seeks to break the political stalemate and keep the city moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
