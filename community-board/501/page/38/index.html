Eight hundred thirty-four injured. Eleven left with wounds so grave they may never heal.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Staten Island CB1 over the past year. These are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><p>On July 5th, Jeremy Claudio, age 34, was riding his motorcycle on Bay Street. A Toyota SUV made a K-turn across traffic. Claudio hit the driver’s door. He died at the hospital. There were no arrests. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>Police said</a> the investigation continues. The street is quiet now, but the loss remains.</p><p>In May, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, tried to cross Targee Street. An e-scooter struck him. He died from his injuries. The driver was thrown from the scooter. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>Paramedics rushed both men to the hospital</a>. Only one came home.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed five people and injured over 400 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but injured several. Even bikes injured a handful. No mode is harmless, but the deadliest are the biggest, fastest, and least forgiving.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h2><p>Some leaders have acted. Council Member Kamillah Hanks voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop the real danger—drivers who do not yield. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The new law</a> says streets belong to people, not just cars.</p><p>But others have failed. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>against</strong> reauthorizing speed cameras in school zones. He also voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to redesign streets for safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>The record is clear</a>: some protect drivers’ convenience, not children’s lives.</p><h2 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h2><p><strong>The deaths will not stop until leaders act.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras, not fewer. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. Every day of delay is another family’s grief.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill is led by Council Member Marjorie Velazquez, though she declined comment as the process continues. The matter, as described by the Regional Plan Association and partners, aims to 'enable merchants or organized groups to tap into the Open Restaurant program and its legal infrastructure, giving new mixed-use space to programs that benefit their communities.' The Alfresco NYC Coalition and advocates like Maulin Mehta support shifting oversight to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a broader, safer approach to curb use. The bill is under active debate, with hearings showing strong support for reclaiming curb space for public benefit, not just cars or restaurants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched. Council Member Erik Bottcher and local activists pushed for the redesign, citing high crash and fatality rates: 173 crashes this year, 40 injuries, and three pedestrian deaths since 2016. Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits.

The grove honors over 2,100 killed and nearly half a million injured since Vision Zero began in 2014. The Parks Department set aside the space, with saplings planted by volunteers and city workers. The memorial stands as a stark reminder: traffic violence is preventable, and victims deserve recognition.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Emissions kill 1,400 city residents each year—more than crashes. Noise from traffic warps bodies and minds. Walking brings health, sanity, and community. Electric cars do not solve the core danger. Streets remain deadly. Walking saves lives.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy, published November 15, 2022, revisits the impact of car dependency a decade after 'Walkable City.' The article, titled 'Walkable City 10 Years Later: Cars Make Us Sicker Than We Thought,' draws on studies showing road emissions cause 53,000 early deaths annually in the U.S., with 1,400 in New York City alone. Healthcare costs from vehicle emissions top $21 billion per year in the city. The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.' It argues that walking and biking foster stronger communities and civic engagement, while car traffic breeds isolation and danger. No council member is named; this is a broad policy critique, not a legislative action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city must keep these ramps in working order, but sidewalks beyond the ramps are excluded. The matter, titled 'Why Do People With Disabilities Have to Sue To Get Accessible Sidewalks?', highlights the city's long resistance to basic ADA compliance. Plaintiffs like Fran Fulton said, 'They're responding to our needs now because we sued them.' Disability Rights Advocates attorney Meredith Weaver called the process 'hard-fought,' noting that leaders' inaction led to injuries and isolation. Weaver stressed that proactive, well-funded sidewalk networks—not lawsuits—would better protect people with mobility challenges.

The city moves to fix a deadly gap.</p><p class=mb3>On November 9, 2022, the Department of Transportation proposed repurposing two car lanes on the Washington Bridge for a two-way protected bike lane and a dedicated bus lane. The plan was presented to Manhattan Community Board 12's Traffic and Transportation committee, which gave unanimous advisory support. The DOT aims to install the changes by summer or early fall 2023. The proposal states: 'The city wants to repurpose a pair of car lanes on the Washington Bridge uptown for a two-way bike lane and a bus lane next year, giving a dedicated space to cyclists who are currently forced to share extremely narrow paths with pedestrians.' Lucia Deng, a Transportation Alternatives activist, called the move 'huge,' noting the Bronx and Upper Manhattan have long been neglected. DOT planner Patrick Kennedy said, 'We try to maintain the protected connections as much as possible. They really only work if they’re continuous.' The plan removes 20 parking spaces but connects vital bike and bus routes, giving thousands of non-drivers safer passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, led by University of Washington researchers, argues that 'rolling back the clocks in November may give millions of Americans an extra hour of sleep, but it also costs human and animal lives on U.S. roads that could be saved by making daylight savings time permanent.' The report found that keeping daylight savings time year-round could prevent 33 human deaths and 36,550 deer deaths annually by reducing crashes during dark hours, especially at peak commute times. A 2004 Rutgers study cited in the report found permanent daylight savings time would cut pedestrian deaths by about 13 percent during dusk and dawn.
