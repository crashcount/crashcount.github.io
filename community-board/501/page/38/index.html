His name was Nacere Ellis. He died from head trauma after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The driver stayed at the scene. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported</a> the NYPD is still investigating.</p><p>A week later, a 13-year-old boy on a moped collided with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. It was 1 a.m. He left the street in critical condition, a head injury sending him to Richmond University Medical Center. The bus driver and passengers walked away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7 wrote</a> nothing about what led up to the crash.

The numbers keep rising. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The dead and injured are not numbers. They are neighbors. In the last 12 months alone, 5 people died and 13 were seriously hurt. Children under 18 made up about one in eight of the injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>5 deaths and 3 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all left their mark. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The silence from local leaders is loud. Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to curb repeat speeders, a measure that could have forced the most dangerous drivers to slow down. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted no</a> even as the bodies piled up. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted <strong>yes</strong> to extend school speed zones, a small step for child safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>He did his part</a>.

The law hits the vulnerable hardest.

Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people first. The dead cannot speak.

Cyclists still face danger. Parks closed the path but failed to set a safe detour. Riders dodge cars, confusion, and construction. The city drags its feet.</p><p class=mb3>The Ocean Parkway bike lane repair project, funded in 2019 by then-Borough President Eric Adams and former Council Member Mark Treyger, finally began in May 2023 after years of delays. The $2.6-million, seven-block overhaul—managed by the Parks Department—targets the cracked 1894 path between avenues R and X. Construction, delayed by the pandemic and contract issues, will continue through March 2024. The Parks Department closed the northernmost block but failed to provide a safe, legal detour for cyclists, leaving them to navigate dangerous service roads and unclear signage. Treyger celebrated the start on social media, thanking advocates. Jon Orcutt of Bike New York criticized Parks for slow, unsafe detour practices, saying, 'They should be working on it based on function.' Lawmakers have introduced legislation to speed up Parks capital projects. Cyclists remain at risk until the city fixes its broken process.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, starting fall 2023 in West Harlem, covers up to 10 residential blocks and 14 public schools. The DSNY report, with McKinsey input, finds containerization viable for most neighborhoods. The matter aims to 'remove garbage bags from sidewalks' and address public health. Council member Shaun Abreu supports the initiative, calling current practices 'backwards' and endorsing large-scale containerization. Advocates like CHEKPEDS founder Christine Berthet support repurposing parking for trash containers, citing sidewalk access. The city will double trash collection in the pilot area, with $5.7 million allocated. The plan faces challenges in dense areas, but signals a shift toward safer, cleaner streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, passed by the state legislature in 2019, remains stuck in federal review. Komanoff suggests, 'let’s give every household in the 12-county MTA region a single untolled trip per month into the congestion zone.' He argues this would address fairness concerns and soften opposition from occasional drivers. The freebie would cut annual net revenues by $110 million, but Komanoff says this could be offset by raising tolls for regular commuters. The proposal aims to preserve congestion pricing’s core goals: less traffic, faster travel, and more funding for transit.

Bus Lane Cameras Reduce Collisions, Speed Commutes, MTA Says,' highlighted MTA data: routes with automated bus lane enforcement (ABLE) saw 25 percent fewer crashes and 5 percent faster bus speeds over four years. MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey testified, calling camera enforcement 'one of the most efficient and effective tools at our disposal.' MTA board member Andrew Albert pushed for more dedicated lanes, while CEO Janno Lieber urged Mayor Adams to meet legal bus lane minimums. The MTA aims to expand cameras to 1,000 buses, covering 80 percent of lanes. The city DOT has fallen behind on required bus lane mileage. Delivery firms like Amazon and UPS are frequent offenders. The MTA is also redesigning routes and reallocating dispatchers to cut bus bunching.

If we want it for our teenagers, we should want it for everyone—because everyone is sharing the roads with each other."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On April 20, 2023, a coalition of transportation advocates launched the Safer Fleets Challenge, urging 50 U.S. communities to install Intelligent Speed Assist (ISA) technology on municipal vehicles by 2025. The campaign, highlighted in a Streetsblog NYC article, states: 'Some of America's most prominent sustainable transportation advocacy organizations are challenging governments to embrace a ground-breaking technology that makes it impossible for drivers to speed, starting with the vehicles in their own fleets.' Former council member Erica Gilmore and America Walks president Mike McGinn voiced strong support. Gilmore said, 'Greater safety, of course, would lead to budget savings over the long run for cities and towns.' The article details ISA pilots in New York City and California, showing fewer crashes and less speeding. Advocates argue that executive orders can quickly retrofit fleets, and broader adoption is overdue. The bill is not yet formal legislation but marks a clear push for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 19, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams endorsed a pilot to make two bus routes free in each borough, totaling ten free buses. The plan is part of the 'Fix the MTA' package, originally championed by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and progressive allies. Adams said, 'I strongly support the thought of having 10 buses being free on lines in the city. I think it would make a major impact.' Mamdani called free buses 'transformative' for working-class New Yorkers. Despite this, other bus improvements lag. Adams pledged 150 miles of new bus lanes in four years, but only 11.95 miles were built last year. Some projects stalled amid political opposition. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber stressed the need for city commitment to bus lanes and warned of fare hikes and service cuts if funding gaps persist. No formal safety analysis was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restore trust. Protect women. Save transit.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published April 17, 2023, urges the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) to revive anti-sexual harassment campaigns. The article states, 'WMATA should consider reviving their anti-harassment campaigns to help create a welcoming environment for women.' Before the pandemic, women made up over half of DC transit riders. Now, their numbers have dropped. WMATA’s past campaigns, run with Stop Street Harassment and Collective Action for Safe Spaces, reduced reported harassment and encouraged reporting. But since 2019, progress has stalled. The author notes that sexual harassment drives women away from transit, pushing them toward cars and taxis. WMATA’s 2023 budget lists anti-harassment as a priority, but action is missing. The piece calls for visible, renewed efforts to protect women and restore trust in public transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
