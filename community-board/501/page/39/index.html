Eight hundred thirty-four injured. Eleven left with wounds so grave they may never heal.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Staten Island CB1 over the past year. These are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><p>On July 5th, Jeremy Claudio, age 34, was riding his motorcycle on Bay Street. A Toyota SUV made a K-turn across traffic. Claudio hit the driver’s door. He died at the hospital. There were no arrests. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>Police said</a> the investigation continues. The street is quiet now, but the loss remains.</p><p>In May, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, tried to cross Targee Street. An e-scooter struck him. He died from his injuries. The driver was thrown from the scooter. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>Paramedics rushed both men to the hospital</a>. Only one came home.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed five people and injured over 400 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but injured several. Even bikes injured a handful. No mode is harmless, but the deadliest are the biggest, fastest, and least forgiving.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h2><p>Some leaders have acted. Council Member Kamillah Hanks voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop the real danger—drivers who do not yield. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The new law</a> says streets belong to people, not just cars.</p><p>But others have failed. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>against</strong> reauthorizing speed cameras in school zones. He also voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to redesign streets for safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>The record is clear</a>: some protect drivers’ convenience, not children’s lives.</p><h2 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h2><p><strong>The deaths will not stop until leaders act.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras, not fewer. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. Every day of delay is another family’s grief.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The numbers speak: lives saved.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the transformation of 34th Avenue into Paseo Park, an open street project in Queens. The project, now two years old as of October 25, 2022, has slashed traffic deaths and injuries. The matter summary states: 'the street has become much safer for all users as it has created dignified public space for all residents.' Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez led the ribbon-cutting. City officials are moving to make the changes permanent. In the last two years, there have been zero traffic deaths on 34th Avenue and a 43 percent drop in crashes in the surrounding area. Pedestrian and cyclist injuries have dropped by half, even as usage soared. Council Member Francisco Moya has not supported expanding Paseo Park into his district, leaving the project stalled at the border. The data show: open streets save lives, cut injuries, and give neighborhoods space to breathe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their size crushes, their height blinds. A tax on these machines would slow the arms race. Money raised could build safer streets. Fewer SUVs, fewer deaths. The danger is clear. The fix is simple. Lawmakers must act.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy, highlighted at the 2022 Vision Zero Cities conference, calls for taxing large vehicles to protect vulnerable road users. The proposal, supported by Transportation Alternatives and Streetsblog NYC, urges policymakers to use tax revenue to fund safer infrastructure. The article states, 'one efficient policy would be to tax large vehicles and use the revenue to build the infrastructure needed for safer streets.' The analysis draws a direct line between the rise of SUVs and pickups and the surge in pedestrian deaths. It notes that the largest vehicles are the deadliest, especially for those on foot or bike. The piece argues that taxing these vehicles would not only discourage their use but also shift the burden of their societal costs back onto their owners. The model follows Washington, D.C.'s recent move to scale registration fees by vehicle size and dedicate funds to safety programs. The message is blunt: fewer giant vehicles, more lives saved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, supported by NYPD and DOT, never reached a vote before Rodriguez’s term ended and has not been reassigned. The bill summary states it 'would require drivers of motor vehicles to maintain a minimum distance of three feet when overtaking a bicycle.' Rodriguez sponsored the bill. Legal experts Daniel Flanzig and Steve Vaccaro criticized the lack of enforcement and the absence of a defined safe passing law, noting that most of the country already has such protections. Flanzig called the law essential to prevent tragedies like the death of Kala Santiago, who was killed by a truck driver on Parkside Avenue. Without this law, cyclists remain at risk, and drivers rarely face consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
