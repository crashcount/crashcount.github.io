Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella put it plainly about botched bus‑lane hours: “That’s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane in order to make a right‑hand turn.” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>amNY</a></p><p>Where It Breaks, How To Fix It</p><ul><li>Daylight the corners on Forest Ave and Jewett Ave. Protect the crosswalks with concrete.

The Senate bill to require <strong>intelligent speed assistance for repeated speed violators</strong> moved this session; on June 12, 2025, State Senator <strong>Andrew Lanza</strong> (SD 24) voted no. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a></p><p>Another lever is speed itself.

The steps are laid out here. <a href=/take_action/>/take_action/</a></p><p>Local officials know the stakes. Assembly Member <strong>Charles Fall</strong> (AD 61) voted yes to extend school speed zones this June. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a></p><p>Forest Ave will still be there tomorrow.

Emissions kill 1,400 city residents each year—more than crashes. Noise from traffic warps bodies and minds. Walking brings health, sanity, and community. Electric cars do not solve the core danger. Streets remain deadly. Walking saves lives.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy, published November 15, 2022, revisits the impact of car dependency a decade after 'Walkable City.' The article, titled 'Walkable City 10 Years Later: Cars Make Us Sicker Than We Thought,' draws on studies showing road emissions cause 53,000 early deaths annually in the U.S., with 1,400 in New York City alone. Healthcare costs from vehicle emissions top $21 billion per year in the city. The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.' It argues that walking and biking foster stronger communities and civic engagement, while car traffic breeds isolation and danger. No council member is named; this is a broad policy critique, not a legislative action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city dragged its feet for decades. Disabled residents faced danger, isolation, and injury. Officials acted only after being sued. Sidewalks beyond ramps remain neglected. Justice came slow, hard-fought.</p><p class=mb3>On November 7, 2022, Philadelphia settled a class-action lawsuit filed in 2019, agreeing to install or repair 10,000 curb ramps over 15 years—at least 2,000 every three years. The city must keep these ramps in working order, but sidewalks beyond the ramps are excluded. The matter, titled 'Why Do People With Disabilities Have to Sue To Get Accessible Sidewalks?', highlights the city's long resistance to basic ADA compliance. Plaintiffs like Fran Fulton said, 'They're responding to our needs now because we sued them.' Disability Rights Advocates attorney Meredith Weaver called the process 'hard-fought,' noting that leaders' inaction led to injuries and isolation. Weaver stressed that proactive, well-funded sidewalk networks—not lawsuits—would better protect people with mobility challenges. This settlement forces overdue action, but leaves many sidewalks unsafe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and bus riders get space. Pedestrians breathe easier. Community board backs the plan. Car drivers lose parking. The city moves to fix a deadly gap.</p><p class=mb3>On November 9, 2022, the Department of Transportation proposed repurposing two car lanes on the Washington Bridge for a two-way protected bike lane and a dedicated bus lane. The plan was presented to Manhattan Community Board 12's Traffic and Transportation committee, which gave unanimous advisory support. The DOT aims to install the changes by summer or early fall 2023. The proposal states: 'The city wants to repurpose a pair of car lanes on the Washington Bridge uptown for a two-way bike lane and a bus lane next year, giving a dedicated space to cyclists who are currently forced to share extremely narrow paths with pedestrians.' Lucia Deng, a Transportation Alternatives activist, called the move 'huge,' noting the Bronx and Upper Manhattan have long been neglected. DOT planner Patrick Kennedy said, 'We try to maintain the protected connections as much as possible. They really only work if they’re continuous.' The plan removes 20 parking spaces but connects vital bike and bus routes, giving thousands of non-drivers safer passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, led by University of Washington researchers, argues that 'rolling back the clocks in November may give millions of Americans an extra hour of sleep, but it also costs human and animal lives on U.S. roads that could be saved by making daylight savings time permanent.' The report found that keeping daylight savings time year-round could prevent 33 human deaths and 36,550 deer deaths annually by reducing crashes during dark hours, especially at peak commute times. A 2004 Rutgers study cited in the report found permanent daylight savings time would cut pedestrian deaths by about 13 percent during dusk and dawn. The researchers stress that systemic changes—like mandatory streetlights, traffic-calming infrastructure, and wildlife crossings—are also needed to protect vulnerable road users and wildlife.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, now two years old as of October 25, 2022, has slashed traffic deaths and injuries. The matter summary states: 'the street has become much safer for all users as it has created dignified public space for all residents.' Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez led the ribbon-cutting. City officials are moving to make the changes permanent. In the last two years, there have been zero traffic deaths on 34th Avenue and a 43 percent drop in crashes in the surrounding area. Pedestrian and cyclist injuries have dropped by half, even as usage soared. Council Member Francisco Moya has not supported expanding Paseo Park into his district, leaving the project stalled at the border.
