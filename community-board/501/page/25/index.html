His name was Nacere Ellis. He died from head trauma after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The driver stayed at the scene. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported</a> the NYPD is still investigating.</p><p>A week later, a 13-year-old boy on a moped collided with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. It was 1 a.m. He left the street in critical condition, a head injury sending him to Richmond University Medical Center. The bus driver and passengers walked away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7 wrote</a> nothing about what led up to the crash. Only the boy’s fate made the news.</p><p>Since 2022, <strong>18 people have died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>30 more suffered serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, workers. The numbers keep rising. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The dead and injured are not numbers. They are neighbors. In the last 12 months alone, 5 people died and 13 were seriously hurt. Children under 18 made up about one in eight of the injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>5 deaths and 3 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all left their mark. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The silence from local leaders is loud. Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to curb repeat speeders, a measure that could have forced the most dangerous drivers to slow down. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted no</a> even as the bodies piled up. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted <strong>yes</strong> to extend school speed zones, a small step for child safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>He did his part</a>.

The law hits the vulnerable hardest.

Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people first. The dead cannot speak.

Shock and injury linger in the dark.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a moped collided head-on with a BMW sedan on Jersey Street at 21:20, then struck a parked Chrysler. The report states, 'A moped hit a BMW head-on, then slammed into a parked Chrysler.' An 18-year-old male passenger on the moped was ejected from his seat and landed on the pavement, suffering a severe head wound and bleeding, with shock noted at the scene. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, highlighting a failure by at least one driver to obey traffic signals or signs. No blame is assigned to the injured passenger. The report notes the passenger was not using a seatbelt, but does not cite this as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the disregard for traffic control, which led to violent impact and injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash laid bare the danger of inattention behind the wheel.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, two sedans collided at 14:02 on Forest Avenue near Goethals Road North. Both vehicles were moving straight when they struck—one at the center front, the other at the right front bumper. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both drivers. A 23-year-old male driver was injured, suffering neck pain and whiplash, but remained conscious and restrained by a lap belt and harness. The female driver of the other sedan was licensed and also sustained front-end damage. The crash underscores the systemic risk posed by driver distraction, even when both drivers are properly licensed and traveling straight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill aims to repeal congestion pricing, add a new MTA board seat for each city borough, and force a forensic audit of the MTA. The matter title reads: 'Relates to repealing congestion pricing (Part A); commissioning an independent audit of the metropolitan transportation authority (Part B); and conducting an environmental impact study (Part C).' Assembly Members Michael Tannousis (primary), Mike Reilly, Samuel Pirozzolo, Michael Novakhov, Lester Chang, and Alec Brook-Krasny sponsor the bill. No safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.

The matter, described as a 'federally funded delivery worker charging station and rest stop,' required LPC review due to its location in a historic district. The project is backed by federal funds secured by Sen. Chuck Schumer. Commissioner Jeanne Lutfy said, 'People need to make a living, they need to make a safe living, and they need to be able to recharge batteries, they need to be able to rest.' Vice Chair Frederick Bland voiced support for the hub's function and design. Commissioner Mark Ginsberg suggested minor design changes. Manhattan Community Board 1 opposed the plan, citing sidewalk encroachment and lack of restrooms. The Parks Department will contract the Workers Justice Project to staff the hub. The project faced delays but is now set to open in late fall.

Eleven miles of missing lanes leave cyclists exposed. Most deaths happen outside protected lanes. The city promised more, but progress stalls. Riders want safety, not scattered paint. The call: connect the gaps, save lives.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published April 15, 2024, urges the city to address gaps in Manhattan’s protected bike lane network. The article highlights that only 3 percent of streets have protected lanes, and 94 percent of cyclist deaths occur outside them. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is required to build 50 miles of protected lanes per year but has missed targets. The author writes, 'quality matters over quantity,' arguing that well-integrated lanes save more lives than disconnected stretches. The piece maps 11.7 miles of missing protected lanes below 60th Street, calling for a one-time investment to connect the Central Business District. The author urges DOT to prioritize quality infrastructure, not just numbers. No council members are named; this is a public call to action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
