A car turns left. The man does not make it home. On January 6, a 68-year-old was killed crossing Forest Avenue. The police report lists the cause: &ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo; and &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). No arrest. No second chance.</p><p>On May 17, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, was crossing Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him. &ldquo;Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY</a>). He died at Richmond University Medical Center. The investigation drags on. The street stays the same.</p><p>On June 29, a 16-year-old riding an electric scooter collided with a Hyundai Tucson. He suffered head trauma and died (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>). The driver stayed. The boy did not.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, four people have died and 834 have been injured on these streets. Eleven were seriously hurt.</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, sons, neighbors. In three and a half years, 17 people have died in Staten Island CB1. More than 2,600 have been injured. Most were walking, biking, or riding. Cars and SUVs did the most harm—five deaths, 293 minor injuries, 137 moderate injuries, three serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed three more. Motorcycles and mopeds, bikes, and vans add to the toll.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted to extend school speed zones, improving child pedestrian safety (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Others do not. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill to curb repeat speeders, opposing a measure that would have forced the most dangerous drivers to slow down (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done so citywide. Cameras catch speeders, but some politicians call them a burden. The streets remain deadly.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-action-not-excuses>Call to Action: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call your state senator. Tell them to lower speed limits, expand enforcement, and redesign streets for people, not cars. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with those who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.

Streets remain deadly. Accountability is missing.</p><p class=mb3>A pending City Council bill would require daylighting—removing parking near corners—at 100 intersections per year. The Department of Transportation opposes the bill. The issue gained urgency after three pedestrians, including 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun, died in separate crashes over the weekend of February 19, 2023. One victim was killed at an intersection where parked cars blocked visibility and the ADA ramp. Another, Zabina Gafoor, was struck by an NYPD vehicle responding to an emergency. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city’s failure to implement proven safety measures, saying, 'Our city’s children deserve to grow up without the threat of traffic violence.' The bill remains pending. Critics say the city’s refusal to daylight intersections and hold drivers accountable continues to put lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Double parking, fumes, and chaos follow. The piece calls for a same-day delivery tax.

The article highlights the unchecked rise of ultra-fast shipping, noting, 'the fallout looks like a veritable armada of delivery trucks triple-parking in your neighborhoods.' The author supports regulation of rapid delivery, investment in transit, and use of micro-mobility for last-mile trips. Council bill number and committee details are not applicable, as this is not a legislative action but a policy proposal. The piece argues that a delivery tax would push consumers toward sustainable choices and fund shared infrastructure, especially transit. It stresses that unchecked delivery harms vulnerable communities with pollution and congestion, and urges cities to prioritize curb management, electric trucks, and e-cargo bikes to protect public space and safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report covers July through October 2022 and cites 'fewer contractors available, shortages in installation materials, and general political opposition' as reasons for a 42% drop in bike lane miles and a 47% drop in bus lane miles compared to the previous year. Streetsblog’s coverage, criticized by City Hall and DOT, revealed that vacancies and political interference—especially from Council Members Bob Holden and Oswald Feliz—stalled projects like the Citi Bike expansion in Queens and the Fordham Road bus lane in the Bronx. DOT completed only 67% of its bus lane mandate and fell 17% short on bike lanes. The city’s own numbers now confirm what advocates warned: delays and obstruction put vulnerable road users in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, questioned whether Mayor Adams is honoring his pledge to end road violence. The matter focused on the administration’s failure to meet Council-mandated benchmarks in the NYC Streets Plan, especially protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers stated, 'No New Yorker should have to fear for their life while crossing or using our streets.' She stressed that enforcement alone is not enough, demanding equitable infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods.

New York, once a leader, has not built heavy rail since 1950. Other countries race forward. Riders wait. Streets stay dangerous. The gap widens. Vulnerable users pay the price for inaction.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, published January 24, 2023, reviews U.S. transit investment using Transit Explorer data. The article states: 'The U.S. is falling behind in transit investment while other countries are rapidly expanding their systems.' No council bill number applies; this is a report, not legislation. No committee or council member is named. The analysis highlights that New York, despite its vast rail network, has not expanded heavy rail since 1950 and has no major projects funded or under construction. In contrast, cities like Toronto and Seattle are building out their systems. The lack of transit growth leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as safe, reliable alternatives to car travel stagnate. The U.S. commitment to transit is faltering while global peers surge ahead.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders now move straighter, faster, safer. Crosswalks grew. Concrete replaced chaos. Thousands of Bronx commuters feel the change underfoot and in the ride.</p><p class=mb3>On January 24, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced sidewalk expansion and new contraflow bus lanes at Pelham Bay Park station in the East Bronx. The project, begun in September 2021 and finished last fall, added 1,285 square feet of sidewalk, a new median, and red bus-only lanes on Westchester Avenue. The DOT worked with the MTA to cut a circuitous bus detour, giving Bx12 and other riders a direct path. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'DOT’s work at Pelham Bay Park... may be only one-10th of a mile, but the impact for thousands of riders will be gigantic.' New York City Transit President Richard Davey added, 'Bus lanes don't have to be miles long to deliver a huge impact.' The changes serve 64,000 daily riders, expanding space for pedestrians and shortening bus trips. More crosswalks now connect the busy transfer point, making the area less hostile for those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsored by Patricia Fahy, the bill addresses how much the state pays for federally assisted projects and for municipal projects with complete street designs. The measure saw broad support, with near-unanimous yes votes in both chambers. The bill's focus is on funding, not on direct safety improvements for pedestrians, cyclists, or other vulnerable road users.
