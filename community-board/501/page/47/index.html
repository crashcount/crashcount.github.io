Eight hundred thirty-four injured. Eleven left with wounds so grave they may never heal.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Staten Island CB1 over the past year. These are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><p>On July 5th, Jeremy Claudio, age 34, was riding his motorcycle on Bay Street. A Toyota SUV made a K-turn across traffic. Claudio hit the driver’s door. He died at the hospital. There were no arrests. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>Police said</a> the investigation continues. The street is quiet now, but the loss remains.</p><p>In May, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, tried to cross Targee Street. An e-scooter struck him. He died from his injuries. The driver was thrown from the scooter. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>Paramedics rushed both men to the hospital</a>. Only one came home.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed five people and injured over 400 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but injured several. Even bikes injured a handful. No mode is harmless, but the deadliest are the biggest, fastest, and least forgiving.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h2><p>Some leaders have acted. Council Member Kamillah Hanks voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop the real danger—drivers who do not yield. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The new law</a> says streets belong to people, not just cars.</p><p>But others have failed. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>against</strong> reauthorizing speed cameras in school zones. He also voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to redesign streets for safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>The record is clear</a>: some protect drivers’ convenience, not children’s lives.</p><h2 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h2><p><strong>The deaths will not stop until leaders act.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras, not fewer. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. Every day of delay is another family’s grief.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The process lets residents as young as 11 vote on capital and expense projects. The official matter title: 'Voting for Participatory Budgeting is open in five Brooklyn districts until April 10.' Joseph, along with councilmembers Jennifer Gutiérrez (34), Chi Ossé (36), Alexa Avilés (38), and Shahana Hanif (39), offers in-person and online voting. Projects range from park upgrades to school improvements. Final results will be announced the week of April 17. Participatory Budgeting shapes how public money is spent, but the safety impact for vulnerable road users depends on which projects win.

Painted bike lanes are blocked by double-parked cars. No protected bike lanes exist near the stadium. The Macombs Dam Bridge approach is hazardous. The Yankees promote transit but ignore cycling.

The proposal, part of the council’s response to the mayor’s $98.5 billion preliminary budget, seeks to expand protected bike lanes to 500 miles, bus lanes to 500 miles, and add 38 million feet of pedestrian space. The council’s plan also introduces 40 miles of car-free busways, a benchmark not found in the mayor’s plan or previous legislation. Adams and other council leaders argue this funding is vital, stating, 'To secure an equitable recovery for our city and improve public safety, we must focus on robust investments.' Transit advocates back the plan, urging the mayor to support safer, more accessible streets for all New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

States and cities move ahead with rebates. Local action grows as federal tax credits shrink. Car trips remain king. Streets stay deadly for walkers and riders. Lawmakers talk, but danger endures.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, published March 28, 2022, reviews the E-BIKE Act and related state bills. The E-BIKE Act, once part of the Build Back Better Act, proposed a federal tax credit for e-bike buyers. Congress reduced the credit from $1,500 to $900 and limited eligibility, stalling progress. The article states, 'By replacing car trips, e-bikes can simultaneously lower emissions, improve street safety, and boost riders' health.' John MacArthur, a transportation program manager, notes that local and state lawmakers now lead with rebates and incentives. Council members and legislators in Vermont, Colorado, California, Washington, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have introduced or supported bills for e-bike rebates. Despite the momentum, no current state proposal pairs incentives with new bike infrastructure. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians and cyclists—remain at risk as car dominance continues and federal action lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plans include painted bus lanes, a partial car-free busway, and a full car-free busway between Morris and Webster avenues. DOT aims to finalize designs by early fall and implement changes by mid-fall 2022. The matter summary states, 'Bus speeds are among the slowest in the city.' Council members are not named, but transit advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance and Juan Restrepo of Transportation Alternatives support the full busway, citing faster buses and safer streets for the majority who walk or ride.
