Tickets soared. Bus speeds rose. Crashes fell. Cameras now outpace NYPD enforcement. Repeat offenders dodge deterrence. Advocates push for tougher penalties. Streets clear, but danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On February 13, 2025, the MTA reported results from its Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) expansion, which began in August 2024. The program, described as 'bus-mounted camera tickets to drivers who double-park along bus routes or park in bus stops,' has issued over 400,000 tickets in five months. The ACE system grew from 623 buses on 14 routes to 1,000 buses on 34 routes by November. MTA spokesperson Laura Cala-Rauch said the program 'is having a big impact on speeding buses and improving the quality of life for New Yorkers.' Data from Jehiah Czebotar shows cameras now issue 76.4% of bus lane and stop tickets—93% by December. Bus speeds rose 5%, crashes involving buses dropped 20%, and emissions fell up to 10%. Persistent violators remain, with some drivers racking up five tickets. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called for escalating fines and legislative changes to target repeat offenders. The ACE program marks a shift toward automated, consistent enforcement, but loopholes for chronic blockers persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law demands the Department of Transportation install pavement markings or temporary lines within five business days after any street resurfacing.

Council hears pleas to reject the cut.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 1050, introduced by Council Member Carmen De La Rosa (D-Inwood), is under City Council review. The bill would cut the required minimum personal injury protection insurance for yellow cabs, liveries, and app-based drivers from $200,000 to $50,000. At a recent hearing, Lauren Pine, a nurse and crash survivor, testified: 'The minimum $50,000 no fault insurance was exhausted within the first week or so of my hospitalization.' Pine urged the Council to oppose the bill, warning that victims of traffic violence would be left financially devastated. Transportation Alternatives’ Ben Furnas also opposed the bill, stating, 'This legislation will ultimately make it more expensive and difficult to access care, treatment, and support after a traffic crash.' The bill is generating support among some council members, but advocates and survivors demand the Council maintain current coverage to protect crash victims.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Promised bus lanes never come. Mayor Adams broke his pledge. The city built just 9.6 miles in two years. Riders wait. DOT blames funding. Council law ignored. Streets stay deadly. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, released February 7, 2025, by the Independent Budget Office, exposes the city’s failure to meet the Streets Master Plan law (passed in 2019) mandating 150 miles of new bus lanes. The IBO states: 'It will be virtually impossible for the city to meet the City Council's required 150 miles of new bus lanes at the pace Mayor Adams is going.' Mayor Adams, who took office in 2022, has slowed or killed key bus projects, including the Fordham Road busway. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno claims the agency is building protected lanes and using cameras for enforcement, but admits resources are tight. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has called for compliance but not funded it. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein blames hiring freezes and political interference for 'broken promises and neglected legislation.' The report shows that while DOT’s budget grew, staffing for bus lane expansion fell. Bus speeds remain stuck at 8.1 mph. The city’s inaction leaves millions of bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—stranded and exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Parking mandates remain in many areas. Housing stays costly. Streets stay carved for cars. Vulnerable road users get no relief. The fight over parking and safety continues. No victory for people on foot or bike.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published January 27, 2025, criticizes the City Council's compromise on the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity (COYHO) zoning amendments. The Council, after pressure from housing opponents, reinstated parking requirements in many transit-served neighborhoods, despite the City Planning Commission's push to eliminate them citywide. The matter, as described, states: 'Anyone not supporting the elimination of parking mandates is only perpetuating our city's housing crisis.' Planning expert Eric Kober, the author, argues the Council's move blocks housing growth and contradicts city policies to reduce car use. Council members' actions—passing a diluted version of COYHO—leave vulnerable road users exposed. The compromise preserves car dominance, keeps streets dangerous, and stalls progress for safer, people-first neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case is not a council bill, but a flashpoint in the debate over child independence and pedestrian safety. Prosecutor Emma Harper said the arrest was due to the boy walking on 'a busy highway with no sidewalk.' The matter highlights how parents, not road designers or drivers, face consequences when children navigate unsafe streets. Advocates, including Lenore Skenazy and attorney David DeLugas, condemned the criminalization of parents and called for accountability in road design. Streets like Mineral Bluff Highway, with high speeds and no sidewalks, endanger all pedestrians. The story underscores a systemic failure: dangerous roads persist, while parents and children bear the risk and blame.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
