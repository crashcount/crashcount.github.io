Twenty-eight left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In just over three years, Staten Island CB1 has seen 5,339 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. In the last twelve months alone, four people died. Eleven more suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed in Westerleigh.</strong> The police said he suffered head trauma. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The story repeats itself. &ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>reported The Brooklyn Paper</a>.</p><p>On July 5th, a motorcyclist died on Bay Street. A car made a K-turn. The bike hit the door. The rider was rushed to the hospital. He did not make it. &ldquo;A motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>wrote amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—438 incidents, five deaths. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds, three more. Bikes: seven injuries, no deaths. The street is not neutral. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children crossing the street. Others block progress. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill that would have curbed repeat speeders—drivers who rack up violations and keep killing. The bill would have forced them to slow down. He said no. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act—or do not. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project faced fierce opposition, with critics predicting economic ruin for local businesses. Streetsblog obtained sales tax data from the Department of Finance, showing that, after the bike lane went in, Skillman Avenue’s main commercial stretch saw a 12 percent increase in sales and a net gain of three businesses. The article states: 'The economy of Skillman Avenue grew after the city built the new lane.' Department of Transportation spokeswoman Mona Bruno praised the redesign, saying, 'It's thrilling to see the neighborhood flourish with safer and more sustainable streets.' Crash data show a 24 percent drop in crashes and a 28 percent drop in injuries after installation. The findings challenge the myth that bike lanes hurt business and highlight the safety gains for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed at a Citizens Union breakfast, centered on the future of the Open Restaurants program. Adams said, "Outdoor dining, in my perspective, should be sidewalk. The street extensions were designed to be temporary." The City Council is currently developing legislation to allow restaurants to use parking lanes, but Adams’s comments signal resistance. Council Member Erik Bottcher countered, calling the use of road space for dining "an overall positive development." Adams’s stance ignores the reality that most city sidewalks are too narrow for sidewalk-only dining, squeezing pedestrians and limiting restaurant survival. Advocates and groups like Transportation Alternatives and Open Plans criticized her position, urging the Council to reclaim public space from cars and support vibrant, safe streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DSNY spokesman Vincent Gragnani said, 'Use of bins in these two different locations...will improve quality of life in these locations, while helping us learn more about containerized trash in a variety of New York City settings.'

No council bill number or committee is attached, as this is a policy report, not legislation. The analysis highlights that regulatory loopholes and weaker standards for larger vehicles allow automakers to offset EV gains by selling more polluting trucks and SUVs. The author urges tightening greenhouse gas standards, especially for large gasoline-powered vehicles, and closing loopholes that let automakers evade meaningful carbon cuts. The report warns that unless regulators act, excessive emissions from pickups and SUVs will harm the climate and city air for years, stalling the benefits of electric vehicles for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilman Lincoln Restler, District 33, is quoted: “We’ve approved $904 million for better bus lanes, more pedestrian space, and protected bike lanes and now we need to pick up the pace on implementation.” Restler pledges robust oversight and accountability, pressing the Department of Transportation to deliver.

Nearly 20% of top agency positions are vacant. The article, titled 'Just Keeping the Lights On,' details how these gaps cripple street safety and improvement projects. Key leadership roles—chief of staff, general counsel, communications director—remain unfilled. Employees blame city hiring policies, pandemic resignations, and weak leadership from Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. One former staffer says, 'We couldn't produce anything new. We were just keeping the lights on.' Another warns, 'The agency's ability to respond to severe injuries and fatalities is also limited and slow.'

The bill, discussed in committee, would cap siren volume at 90 decibels and encourage use of vibrating, low-frequency siren technology. The matter title calls for 'mandating the use of hi-lo, "two-tone" sirens by emergency response vehicles.' Brewer wrote, 'the city should mandate that emergency responders use hi-lo as their default siren and cap sirens at 90 decibels—as required by the proposed legislation—and scale up their use of vibrating siren technology.' The bill seeks to cut the health harms of constant siren noise, which studies link to hypertension and heart disease.

Oil, auto, and insurance giants profit while public transit withers. Politicians suspend gas taxes, starving transit funds. Predatory loans and high insurance rates bleed drivers. Vulnerable road users pay the price in blood and dollars.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published September 7, 2022, on Streetsblog NYC, attacks the narrative that congestion pricing is a 'cash grab.' Author Nicole A. Murray argues the true financial and social burden comes from car culture itself. The article highlights how automotive, oil, and insurance industries siphon money from the public, while political decisions—like Governor Hochul's gas tax suspension—undercut transit funding. The piece states: 'The real cash grab: the silent hands that the automotive and subsidiary industries have in our pockets—all of our pockets—every day.' Murray calls out the hypocrisy of congestion pricing opponents who ignore the needs of transit-dependent New Yorkers. No council bill number or committee is involved; this is a public statement, not legislation. The article exposes how car dependency and predatory lending practices trap working families, while public transportation offers a path to freedom and safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
