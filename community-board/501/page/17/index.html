Twenty-eight left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In just over three years, Staten Island CB1 has seen 5,339 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. In the last twelve months alone, four people died. Eleven more suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed in Westerleigh.</strong> The police said he suffered head trauma. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The story repeats itself. &ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>reported The Brooklyn Paper</a>.</p><p>On July 5th, a motorcyclist died on Bay Street. A car made a K-turn. The bike hit the door. The rider was rushed to the hospital. He did not make it. &ldquo;A motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>wrote amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—438 incidents, five deaths. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds, three more. Bikes: seven injuries, no deaths. The street is not neutral. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children crossing the street. Others block progress. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill that would have curbed repeat speeders—drivers who rack up violations and keep killing. The bill would have forced them to slow down. He said no. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act—or do not. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, details Samuelsen’s resignation from the Traffic Mobility Review Board on November 30, 2023, the day tolling recommendations were released. He argued, 'Congestion pricing alone will not reduce traffic to its fullest potential. Central business district tolling should absolutely be coupled with massive increases and improvements in public transit service.' Samuelsen criticized the MTA for not expanding service and called the toll 'classist.' His stance shifted from earlier support in 2019 to strong opposition, citing unmet promises and risks to transit funding. No council bill or committee action is noted. The union’s move leaves vulnerable road users facing the same old dangers: crowded streets, slow buses, and stalled safety reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The original lane reduction and protected bike lane plan, previously scrapped, will now move forward for the southern half of the street, between Calyer Street and Meeker Avenue. The matter, described as a return to 'the road diet it had previously finalized and then rejected,' follows months of community outcry and advocacy. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and other local officials celebrated the move, crediting the Make McGuinness Safe coalition for relentless pressure. Restler stated, 'this is a decision that enhances safety in our community, and that's what matters.' The northern half of the boulevard remains unchanged, with two traffic lanes and barrier-protected bike lanes.

The ask is historic. Riders face risk if lawmakers stall. Infrastructure needs loom. Governor Hochul promises a fight for funds. The gap is wide. The stakes are high for New York’s streets.</p><p class=mb3>On September 25, 2024, the MTA submitted its $68 billion capital plan funding request to Albany. The plan, described as 'the biggest in the MTA's history,' now awaits review by a panel with appointees from the governor, legislative leaders, and the NYC mayor. Andrea Stewart-Cousins is mentioned in connection with the event. MTA Chair Janno Lieber stressed the plan's aim to 'protect riders from a decline in service due to infrastructure that’s been...neglected or left unfixed.' Governor Kathy Hochul pledged to 'fight to secure as much funding as possible.' The MTA expects $14 billion from the federal government, $8 billion from Albany and the city, and $13 billion from its own debt, leaving a $33 billion gap for the state to fill. The plan’s fate will shape the safety and reliability of transit for millions of New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The controversy centers on a planned bike lane in Queens’ District 26, championed by Councilwoman Julie Won. The city aims to connect the Pulaski and Kosciuszko bridges via Borden, Starr, and Review avenues. The project, requested by local civic groups and the community board, follows five deaths—including two cyclists—and over 170 injuries on these roads in five years. Won stated, 'We need to do everything we can to ensure we don’t lose another life to a preventable death.' Thirty-two business owners petitioned DOT to halt the project, citing truck maneuvering dangers. DOT representative Vincent Barone called the route 'a critical gap' in the bike network and promised 'much-needed safety improvements.' The plan will take up to 15 feet from Review Avenue for a two-way bike path and buffer, leaving 22 feet for traffic.
