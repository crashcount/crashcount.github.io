His name was Nacere Ellis. He died from head trauma after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The driver stayed at the scene. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported</a> the NYPD is still investigating.</p><p>A week later, a 13-year-old boy on a moped collided with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. It was 1 a.m. He left the street in critical condition, a head injury sending him to Richmond University Medical Center. The bus driver and passengers walked away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7 wrote</a> nothing about what led up to the crash.

The numbers keep rising. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The dead and injured are not numbers. They are neighbors. In the last 12 months alone, 5 people died and 13 were seriously hurt. Children under 18 made up about one in eight of the injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>5 deaths and 3 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all left their mark. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The silence from local leaders is loud. Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to curb repeat speeders, a measure that could have forced the most dangerous drivers to slow down. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted no</a> even as the bodies piled up. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted <strong>yes</strong> to extend school speed zones, a small step for child safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>He did his part</a>.

The law hits the vulnerable hardest.

Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people first. The dead cannot speak.

The plan, part of ongoing budget talks, aims to fund hundreds of miles of protected bike and bus lanes, plus concrete barriers. Council Member Lincoln Restler of District 33, a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, praised the move as 'a very clear commitment to addressing street safety across the five boroughs.' The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists. The Council had requested $3.1 billion, but Restler called the $900 million a dramatic investment. The budget must be finalized by June 30.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Adams, in a statement, called his commitment to the program 'steadfast.' The announcement pledges up to $20,000 per site for non-profits to cover costs like barriers and signage. The program, launched during the pandemic, lets residents walk and gather in streets closed to cars. Council action is not specified, but the mayor's office leads. The city promises to focus on underserved neighborhoods, aiming for equity. Still, most operations rely on volunteers, not city workers. Car owners protest the loss of parking. The Horticultural Society of New York will assist with management and upkeep. The city’s support is real but limited. Vulnerable road users get space, but the system leans on unpaid labor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Decades of rising car ownership brought longer, not shorter, trips. Streets stay dangerous. Pollution and risk fall hardest on communities of color. The answer is not more cars. It is safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, released April 20, 2022, reviews a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The report, titled 'Study: Car Ownership Doesn’t Always Cut Black Workers’ Commutes,' finds that despite an increase in car ownership among Black workers—from 76% in 1980 to 85% in 2019—average commute times grew longer, not shorter. The study states, 'it may not be possible to speed up city commutes with automotive strategies alone.' The gap in commute times between Black and White workers persists, especially in large, segregated cities. The article warns that subsidizing driving will make streets more polluted and dangerous, with the heaviest toll on communities of color. It calls for investment in bus rapid transit, trains, and active transportation, and for building communities where jobs and housing are close. No council member is named; this is a research release, not a legislative action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Painted bike lanes are blocked by double-parked cars. No protected bike lanes exist near the stadium. The Macombs Dam Bridge approach is hazardous. The Yankees promote transit but ignore cycling.

The proposal, part of the council’s response to the mayor’s $98.5 billion preliminary budget, seeks to expand protected bike lanes to 500 miles, bus lanes to 500 miles, and add 38 million feet of pedestrian space. The council’s plan also introduces 40 miles of car-free busways, a benchmark not found in the mayor’s plan or previous legislation. Adams and other council leaders argue this funding is vital, stating, 'To secure an equitable recovery for our city and improve public safety, we must focus on robust investments.' Transit advocates back the plan, urging the mayor to support safer, more accessible streets for all New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

States and cities move ahead with rebates. Local action grows as federal tax credits shrink. Car trips remain king. Streets stay deadly for walkers and riders. Lawmakers talk, but danger endures.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, published March 28, 2022, reviews the E-BIKE Act and related state bills. The E-BIKE Act, once part of the Build Back Better Act, proposed a federal tax credit for e-bike buyers. Congress reduced the credit from $1,500 to $900 and limited eligibility, stalling progress. The article states, 'By replacing car trips, e-bikes can simultaneously lower emissions, improve street safety, and boost riders' health.' John MacArthur, a transportation program manager, notes that local and state lawmakers now lead with rebates and incentives. Council members and legislators in Vermont, Colorado, California, Washington, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have introduced or supported bills for e-bike rebates. Despite the momentum, no current state proposal pairs incentives with new bike infrastructure. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians and cyclists—remain at risk as car dominance continues and federal action lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
