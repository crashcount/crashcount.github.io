Twenty-eight left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In just over three years, Staten Island CB1 has seen 5,339 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. In the last twelve months alone, four people died. Eleven more suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed in Westerleigh.</strong> The police said he suffered head trauma. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The story repeats itself. &ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>reported The Brooklyn Paper</a>.</p><p>On July 5th, a motorcyclist died on Bay Street. A car made a K-turn. The bike hit the door. The rider was rushed to the hospital. He did not make it. &ldquo;A motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>wrote amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—438 incidents, five deaths. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds, three more. Bikes: seven injuries, no deaths. The street is not neutral. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Some leaders act. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children crossing the street. Others block progress. State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill that would have curbed repeat speeders—drivers who rack up violations and keep killing. The bill would have forced them to slow down. He said no. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act—or do not. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Departments of Sanitation and Transportation used narrow plows to clear bike lanes, including the East River bridges and key protected paths. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "We put salt on every street, every highway, every bike lane in the city, we've done multiple passes at it." The DOT boasted about clearing the Brooklyn Bridge bike path before sunrise. Citi Bike stayed open. But sidewalks, left to property owners, remained treacherous. Mayor Adams praised road crews while standing by snow-covered pedestrian space. Commissioner Tisch warned, "We want those sidewalks safe tomorrow." The city’s effort favored cyclists and drivers. Pedestrians were left behind, forced to wait for landlords to shovel.

Borelli (District 51) joined seventeen other lawmakers in a federal lawsuit to block New York City’s $15 congestion pricing toll for Midtown Manhattan. The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation.

The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation. The case highlights the political and environmental battle over how to fund and shape New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation will install stationary curbside trash enclosures for buildings with 31 or more units in Manhattan Community Board 9 by spring 2025. The policy, championed by Mayor Adams, follows a pilot that cut rat sightings by 68 percent. Adams called the new side-loading truck 'the future of New York City garbage collection.' The plan replaces about 150,000 parking spots—five percent of the city’s total—with trash containers. Smaller buildings will use wheeled bins on sidewalks. Advocates support the move, urging shared containers to keep sidewalks clear. Some warn that too many bins could harm businesses and streetscapes. The city will study environmental impacts before rollout. The expansion aims to reclaim space from cars, clear sidewalks, and improve safety for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He writes, 'The increasing size of passenger vehicles has been catastrophic for road safety, traffic congestion, climate viability, and household budgets.' Komanoff opposes SUV and pickup proliferation and supports downsizing, electrification, and policies like road pricing and better transit. He stresses that larger vehicles are far more likely to kill other road users. He argues that electrification and smaller cars alone cannot cut emissions or deaths enough. Only less driving, paired with systemic changes—congestion pricing, curb pricing, and livable streets—will protect the vulnerable and the climate. No council bill is attached, but the warning is clear: car bloat endangers everyone outside the vehicle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Reynoso urged ongoing oversight, saying, 'It is important that DSNY continuously reassess implementation and course correct as needed.' Yet, delays persist, especially on installing guard rails to prevent pedestrians and cyclists from being swept under trucks. Justin Wood of NYLPI voiced concern over the slow rollout.

Warehouses choke streets. Black and Latino residents breathe the fumes and dodge danger. Lawmakers push the Clean Deliveries Act to curb the chaos. The burden falls hard. The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>The Clean Deliveries Act, now under consideration in Albany, aims to regulate last-mile warehouse traffic and emissions across New York State. The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Sanitation Committee, chaired by Council Member Sandy Nurse (District 37), led the debate. The hearing focused on the city’s failure to remove unregistered, plateless cars. In 2023, over 51,000 complaints were filed, but only 1,821 cars were towed. Nurse said, 'Cars with ghost plates are a risk to public safety.' Council Member Shaun Abreu pushed for a bill to streamline the Department of Sanitation’s towing process, but DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch opposed it, citing legal and operational hurdles. The NYPD and DSNY formed a task force, but advocates and councilmembers say it is not enough. The city’s lack of action leaves vulnerable road users exposed to reckless, untraceable drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill remains stalled after DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch testified against it, citing operational and legal hurdles. The matter, discussed in the Sanitation Committee led by Council Member Sandy Nurse, highlights a citywide crisis: over 51,000 complaints about plateless cars in 2023, but only 1,821 removals. The article quotes Nurse—'Cars with ghost plates are a risk to public safety'—and Abreu, who calls the city’s inaction a repurposing of public space for dumping. Despite a DSNY/NYPD task force, enforcement remains weak. The city’s failure leaves reckless drivers unaccountable and endangers everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Drivers ignored them. Cars block both ends. Cyclists forced into traffic. Police rarely ticket. Council stalls on citizen reporting. The city’s fix failed. Cyclists pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On January 12, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported on the failure of new concrete barriers meant to protect bike lanes on Park Avenue in the Bronx. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
