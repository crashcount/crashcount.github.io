His name was Nacere Ellis. He died from head trauma after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The driver stayed at the scene. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported</a> the NYPD is still investigating.</p><p>A week later, a 13-year-old boy on a moped collided with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. It was 1 a.m. He left the street in critical condition, a head injury sending him to Richmond University Medical Center. The bus driver and passengers walked away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7 wrote</a> nothing about what led up to the crash.

The numbers keep rising. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The dead and injured are not numbers. They are neighbors. In the last 12 months alone, 5 people died and 13 were seriously hurt. Children under 18 made up about one in eight of the injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>5 deaths and 3 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all left their mark. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The silence from local leaders is loud. Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to curb repeat speeders, a measure that could have forced the most dangerous drivers to slow down. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted no</a> even as the bodies piled up. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted <strong>yes</strong> to extend school speed zones, a small step for child safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>He did his part</a>.

The law hits the vulnerable hardest.

Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people first. The dead cannot speak.

Riders lose lifelines. Streets fill with cars. Congestion rises. Pedestrians and cyclists face more danger. New York’s MTA repair plans gutted after congestion pricing dies. Leaders stall. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published September 20, 2024, details a wave of transit funding crises nationwide, with New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) at the center. The article, titled '‘Doom Loop’ Alert: Transit Systems are Suffering — And Too Many Are Cutting Service,' chronicles how pandemic relief funds are running dry, ridership lags, and costs soar. Governor Kathy Hochul killed congestion pricing, stripping the MTA of $1 billion a year. Now, the agency slashes repair programs. Streetsblog quotes transit leaders warning that service cuts mean crowded buses, more cars, and lost productivity. Council members and mayors in cities like Miami and Philadelphia face similar choices. The story makes clear: when transit fails, vulnerable road users—those who walk, bike, or rely on buses—face greater risk. The systemic danger grows as public transportation falters and streets fill with traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users face rising danger as cars reclaim the city.</p><p class=mb3>A new Streetlight Data report, released September 12, 2024, shows car miles traveled in the New York City metro area rose 14 percent over five years. The report singles out New York: 'where congestion pricing was paused, stands out as the urban core with the biggest increase in both congestion and VMT among the top 25.' Governor Hochul’s decision to halt congestion pricing drew sharp criticism from advocates. Sara Lind, Co-Executive Director of Open Plans, called the move 'disastrous,' warning that abandoning congestion pricing is a 'dereliction of duty' on street safety. The report blames city inaction on bus and bike lanes for worsening gridlock. As driving surges, vulnerable road users face greater risk. The city’s failure to curb car use puts lives on the line.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, described as a 'citywide subway accessibility day of action,' spotlighted the $15 billion shortfall now facing the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan. According to the event summary, 'the cancellation of elevator installations at 23 subway stations' followed the funding cut. Gallagher condemned the decision, declaring, 'We all matter, and we all need elevators, and we all need congestion pricing.' Comptroller Brad Lander called the move 'shameful.' The rally demanded immediate reinstatement of congestion pricing to restore funding for subway accessibility, directly impacting disabled New Yorkers, parents, and seniors.

Mayor Adams slashed $20 million from the Parks budget, worsening the crisis.

Brian Hedden of the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative urges a citywide fix. The matter title: 'Dead Trees Highlight Multiple City Failures on Sunset Park Greenway.'

The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Paint and ticket blitzes failed. Bus speeds barely moved. Riders remain stuck in traffic. Cars clog lanes. Promised fixes scrapped. Advocates demand real action. The city stalls. Riders suffer.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2024, MTA officials sent a scathing letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, criticizing the city’s decision to abandon plans to upgrade Fordham Road’s curbside bus lanes to offset bus lanes. The letter, signed by outgoing NYCT President Richard Davey and interim successor Demetrius Crichlow, called the city’s paint-and-enforcement approach a 'total bust.' The MTA cited new data showing bus speeds increased just 2–4 percent since October 2022—far below the 15 percent target. The matter summary reads: 'The Fordham Road project enjoys widespread support from transit advocacy groups, and Fordham Road bus riders, who have been enduring slow service for decades.' Council involvement is not specified, but the MTA’s letter and Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein both demand stronger measures. The city’s inaction leaves Bronx bus riders stranded in slow traffic, with vulnerable road users paying the price for political compromise.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative describes the rider being ejected from the motorcycle, suffering severe bleeding and injuries to his entire body. The sedan’s side was heavily damaged. The crash occurred at 18:23.

Council Member Weprin is mentioned.</p><p class=mb3>On August 11, 2024, Council Member David Weprin (District 24) was mentioned in a report examining alternatives to congestion pricing for MTA funding. The Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA (PCAC) found that 'various proposals to replace the mass transit money lost from pausing congestion pricing either don’t raise the same revenue or fail to achieve other benefits such as reduced traffic from the Manhattan toll.' The report, reviewed by Weprin, details that none of the eight alternatives—ranging from payroll taxes to casino revenue—would match congestion pricing’s $1 billion annual yield or its bondable value. Lisa Daglian, PCAC’s executive director, said these options either fall short on funding or burden working New Yorkers, while missing out on cleaner air and less traffic. The MTA has suspended billions in modernization work. The pause leaves vulnerable riders and city streets exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
