An e-scooter hit him. He died in the hospital. The driver was thrown from the scooter. No arrests. No answers. Police could not confirm the speed or direction of the e-scooter at the time of the collision (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>AMNY report</a>). The street stayed open. The blood washed away. The danger did not.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> on Staten Island CB1 streets. <strong>Nine more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Seven of the dead or gravely hurt were over 55. Children were not spared: <strong>93 kids were injured</strong> in crashes in the last year. The numbers do not rest. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=streets-that-do-not-forgive>Streets That Do Not Forgive</h2><p>Most deaths came from cars and SUVs. <strong>Sedans killed two. SUVs killed three.</strong> Trucks, buses, and vans took more. Bikes and mopeds left their own scars. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise. A man in a crosswalk on Forest Avenue was hit by an SUV. He died. The driver failed to yield. He never stood a chance (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Police cars crash too. In March, two officers swerved to avoid a U-turn and slammed into a restaurant. &ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>witness account</a>) said a witness. The officers lived. Next time, it could be a child on the sidewalk.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; But the speed limit on most streets is still 25 mph. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower it to 20 mph. They have not done it. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city calls for more enforcement. The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Swapping car trips for bike rides cuts carbon now. Active travel means cleaner air, fewer cars, safer streets. The study shows: pedal power outpaces battery power in the race against climate disaster.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, released June 3, 2022, reviews global transport emissions and the impact of cycling versus electric cars. The report, titled 'Study: Cycling is 10x More Important Than Electric Cars For Reaching Net Zero,' finds that 'tackling the climate and air pollution crises requires curbing all motorised transport, particularly private cars, as quickly as possible.' No council members are named; this is a research-driven analysis, not a legislative action. The study tracked 4,000 urban residents across Europe, showing daily cyclists had 84% lower travel emissions than non-cyclists. It argues that active travel—cycling, walking, e-biking—cuts emissions faster than waiting for electric cars to replace gas vehicles. The findings highlight the urgent need to reduce car use, not just electrify it, to protect vulnerable road users and the environment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to fine drivers $50 for each infraction, targeting those who block or drive in bike lanes. The matter summary states: 'NYC pols propose traffic cameras to deter drivers from using bike lanes.' Mamdani and Hoylman argue that enforcement is critical, with Mamdani stating, 'You consistently see cars driving in the bike lane. We know that these cameras work to deter drivers from breaking the law.' DOT supports the measure, calling it 'life-saving automated enforcement technology.' The bill awaits City Council approval, with Mamdani pledging to advance it through the summer and fall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure passed 51-12 and now moves to the Assembly. The bill allows cameras to operate 24/7 in nearly 2,000 locations across 750 school zones until July 1, 2025. The matter summary states, 'The proposal to extend New York City's speed camera program for another three years and expand it to run every day and around the clock easily passed.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored the bill, saying, 'We are going to see a marked reduction in traffic violence on our streets at a time when traffic deaths are at their highest in a decade.' Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams. Some penalties for repeat speeders were removed during negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Mary Cheh says it’s a step to offset harm from oversized vehicles.</p><p class=mb3>On May 27, 2022, the D.C. Council passed a bill to increase registration fees for large SUVs. The measure, led by Transportation Committee Chairwoman Mary Cheh, boosts fees to $500 for vehicles over 6,000 pounds, $250 for 5,000–6,000 pounds, and $175 for 3,500–5,000 pounds. The bill summary states, 'the larger a vehicle, the worse it is for the environment, the more damage it causes to our roads, and the more dangerous to others using the roadway.' Cheh, who wrote the proposal, said, 'drivers who pick these larger vehicles will now need to pay a bit more to compensate for that additional damage.' The council expects the new fees to raise $40 million over five years, funding street safety projects and road repairs. Cheh admits the policy is not a cure-all for traffic violence but calls it a step forward to recoup costs from oversized vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Carlina Rivera’s office noted her bill would require protections for cyclists around work zones, highlighting the gap in current planning. Executive Director Terri Carta of the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative said, 'NYC Parks and DOT need to provide a safe alternative for greenway users during construction.'

Streets stay clogged. Death and pollution hold steady. The state’s gas tax holiday cuts prices, not crashes. Transit ridership lags. Oil giants profit. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price. The city breathes fumes and fear.</p><p class=mb3>On May 16, 2022, Streetsblog NYC reported that New Yorkers’ gasoline use remains nearly unchanged since before the pandemic. State gas tax revenue shows only a 7.5 percent dip from March 2020 to March 2022. The upcoming gas tax holiday, set for June 1, will drop pump prices by 16 cents per gallon. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance called the holiday 'an outrageous windfall for oil profiteers' and demanded Governor Hochul cancel highway expansions and invest in frequent public transit. The bill is not before a council committee, but the advocacy statement highlights the ongoing threat to vulnerable road users: steady car traffic means steady danger. Pollution, congestion, and road death remain constant. The state’s policy props up driving, not safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
