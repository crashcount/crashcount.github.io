They do not lie.</p><h2 id=streets-that-do-not-forgive>Streets That Do Not Forgive</h2><p>Most deaths came from cars and SUVs. <strong>Sedans killed two. SUVs killed three.</strong> Trucks, buses, and vans took more. Bikes and mopeds left their own scars. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise. A man in a crosswalk on Forest Avenue was hit by an SUV. He died. The driver failed to yield. He never stood a chance (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Police cars crash too.

They say, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; But the speed limit on most streets is still 25 mph. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower it to 20 mph. They have not done it. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city calls for more enforcement. The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No more waiting. No more trade-offs. Commissioner Tisch says every street gets cleared together. Cyclists will not be left stranded in snow. The city finally treats bike lanes as vital.</p><p class=mb3>On December 21, 2023, the Department of Sanitation announced a major shift in snow removal policy. Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch declared, “For the first time the plan calls for doing both at the same time, rather than prioritizing one over the other or making trade-offs.” This policy change ends years of prioritizing car lanes over bike lanes for snow clearance. The agency updated its annual snow plan and hired 563 new workers, now able to dispatch plows for all routes simultaneously. The new approach means protected bike lanes—165 miles worth—will be cleared alongside roads, not after. Tisch emphasized, “Every street in the city is on a route and we are staffed to dispatch every route at the same time. Prioritization of certain streets is a thing of the past.” Advocates, including Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, praised the move as overdue and vital for cyclists’ safety. The city’s snow fleet now includes smaller plows fit for bike lanes, ending the era of neglect.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to providing information on the reduced fare programs to persons issued a summons for fare evasion.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Brooks-Powers, Brewer, Dinowitz, Barron, Krishnan, and others. The flyers must explain eligibility, discount details, and application steps. The law took effect 120 days after passage. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was noted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the police department to report on the justification for the stop in vehicle encounter reports," demands the NYPD document every vehicle stop. Reports must include the reason for the stop, the level of offense, and demographic details, but no personal identifiers. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and others led the charge. The law aims to expose patterns in police stops and holds officers to account. Reports go online, open to all. This is a step toward transparency, not just for drivers, but for every New Yorker who walks, rides, or waits at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, shaped by advocacy campaigns, was summarized as offering 'more flexibility to design roads safely,' but advocates say it is 'a transitional document; it’s not a transformational document.' FHWA Administrator Shailen Bhatt claimed the update empowers cities to prioritize active transportation, stating, 'The cities that are really thriving... are the ones who are really putting active transportation at the forefront.' However, advocates like Mike McGinn and Beth Osborne criticized the weak reforms to the 85th percentile speed rule and the lack of bold safety mandates. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law now requires updates every four years, giving hope for future, stronger reforms. For now, the MUTCD still leaves vulnerable road users at risk, with only incremental gains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, voiced 'serious concerns about the proposal’s impact on her constituents, especially with the looming arrival of congestion pricing.' She called for an 'equitable and balanced' approach. The plan faces backlash over wider stop spacing and fewer stops, which could force longer walks for riders—many of them elderly or disabled.

Delivery workers still pay for safety. Sixteen dead, 253 fires this year. City backs the bill. Tech giants resist supplying safe batteries. Workers face high costs. Danger persists on city streets.</p><p class=mb3>On December 11, 2023, a congressional panel advanced the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act, introduced by Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-Bronx). The bill, supported by the city and FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh, requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to create federal safety standards for micromobility batteries. The matter summary states the bill aims to 'protect against the risk of fires.' Torres and advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project pushed for app-based companies to supply certified batteries, but tech giants oppose this. Kavanagh said, 'A strong federal standard for lithium-ion batteries is required to ensure public safety.' Despite new laws, the cost of safe batteries—up to $5,000—still falls on low-paid delivery workers. Sixteen people have died in 253 battery fires this year.

The burden remains on the most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, now entering a 60-day public review, sets a $15 daytime toll for drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street.

MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'If you change one aspect – the whole thing starts to unravel or fall apart.' Council Member Robert F. Holden was mentioned in the discussion. The board is reconsidering tolls on school buses, but most exemptions are opposed. Lawsuits from New Jersey officials threaten delays.
