Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella put it plainly about botched bus‑lane hours: “That’s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane in order to make a right‑hand turn.” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>amNY</a></p><p>Where It Breaks, How To Fix It</p><ul><li>Daylight the corners on Forest Ave and Jewett Ave. Protect the crosswalks with concrete.

The Senate bill to require <strong>intelligent speed assistance for repeated speed violators</strong> moved this session; on June 12, 2025, State Senator <strong>Andrew Lanza</strong> (SD 24) voted no. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a></p><p>Another lever is speed itself.

The steps are laid out here. <a href=/take_action/>/take_action/</a></p><p>Local officials know the stakes. Assembly Member <strong>Charles Fall</strong> (AD 61) voted yes to extend school speed zones this June. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a></p><p>Forest Ave will still be there tomorrow.

Now, more low-income New Yorkers get half-price MetroCards. The move adds $10 million to the program. Over one million people now qualify. Councilmember Brannan calls it a step for equity. Advocates want more.</p><p class=mb3>On June 28, 2024, the City Council expanded the Fair Fares MetroCard program, raising eligibility from 120% to 145% of the federal poverty line. The change, part of the Fiscal Year 2025 budget, was championed by Council Finance Chair Justin Brannan. The bill increases access for individuals earning up to $21,837 and families of four earning $45,240. The council added $10 million in funding, bringing the total to over $100 million annually. Brannan and economist James Parrott wrote, 'By expanding the reach of Fair Fares, we can ensure that all New Yorkers—particularly those who are already struggling during a crisis of affordability—can fully participate in the economic, social, and cultural opportunities of our city.' The expansion boosts eligibility from 932,000 to just over 1 million people. Advocates and Speaker Adrienne Adams say it is a win, but still short of the 200% threshold they seek.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers lose safe, reliable transit. The crisis deepens.</p><p class=mb3>On June 26, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul announced an 'indefinite pause' on congestion pricing, derailing the $40-billion 'Fast Forward' plan for subway and bus improvements. The MTA board approved the pause, forcing a $16 billion cut in capital spending. Projects delayed include modern signals, station accessibility, new trains, and electric buses. The plan, crafted by former NYC Transit President Andy Byford, aimed to fix decades of neglect. Byford said, 'The Fast Forward plan we created in 2018 is as necessary today as it was then.' MTA board member Norman Brown lamented, 'We're turning the clock back.' The pause leaves vulnerable riders—especially low-income New Yorkers—exposed to unreliable, unsafe transit. No new funding is secured. The system’s future hangs in the balance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, pitched as a school safety upgrade, will replace painted bike lanes with a two-way protected lane, add sidewalk extensions, and close two slip lanes. DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals. DOT staffer Alex Ussery said, 'We’ve received some concerns from the community and various elected officials specifically regarding safety around students.' Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.' Installation will begin this summer and finish in the fall. No council member directly sponsored or voted on this DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Politicians split. Riders left stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the MTA Board heard public testimony and political debate on the fallout from Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing, which was set to begin June 30. The meeting focused on the loss of funding for transit accessibility. The matter, described as 'New Yorkers decry loss of congestion pricing money for accessible transit to MTA Board,' drew sharp criticism from disability advocates and riders. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, representing District 23, praised the Governor’s pause, calling congestion pricing 'the wrong plan for my constituents.' The pause leaves a $15 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, halting upgrades like elevators and ramps at dozens of stations. Advocates warned that without this funding, disabled New Yorkers, seniors, and veterans remain shut out of the subway. The MTA faces a federal mandate to make 95% of stations accessible by 2055, but these projects now stall. Riders demanded action. Politicians offered little hope.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in the Municipal Services Committee, would force cars and taxis to turn off, leaving the lane for buses, trucks, and emergency vehicles. The matter summary notes, 'The Bx36 bus, which travels this corridor, is among the slowest in the Bronx, with speeds dropping to as low as 4.5 miles per hour.' Council Members Pierina Sanchez and Oswald Feliz, who represent the area, expressed cautious optimism and called for community engagement. Committee Chair Lucia Deng reported, 'There was zero pushback on the concept of busways or bus lanes.' The committee even pushed for a longer route. DOT will conduct further analysis and present detailed plans to local boards in the fall. No formal safety assessment for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pretlow, along with state Sen. Joe Addabo, is vocal about expediting casino approvals.

It urges Governor Hochul to reject the casino plan, praising her past opposition to congestion pricing rollbacks.
