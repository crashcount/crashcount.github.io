An e-scooter hit him. He died in the hospital. The driver was thrown from the scooter. No arrests. No answers.

The street stayed open. The blood washed away. The danger did not.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> on Staten Island CB1 streets. <strong>Nine more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Seven of the dead or gravely hurt were over 55. Children were not spared: <strong>93 kids were injured</strong> in crashes in the last year. The numbers do not rest. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=streets-that-do-not-forgive>Streets That Do Not Forgive</h2><p>Most deaths came from cars and SUVs. <strong>Sedans killed two. SUVs killed three.</strong> Trucks, buses, and vans took more. Bikes and mopeds left their own scars. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise. A man in a crosswalk on Forest Avenue was hit by an SUV. He died. The driver failed to yield. He never stood a chance (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Police cars crash too. In March, two officers swerved to avoid a U-turn and slammed into a restaurant. &ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car.

They say, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; But the speed limit on most streets is still 25 mph. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower it to 20 mph. They have not done it. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city calls for more enforcement. The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They kill more, clog streets, burn more fuel. Komanoff says electrification and downsizing are not enough. Driving must fall. Road pricing, better transit, and livable streets matter as much as cleaner cars. The toll is real.</p><p class=mb3>On February 1, 2024, Charles Komanoff published an op-ed in Streetsblog NYC warning of the dangers of rising SUV and pickup truck use. He writes, 'The increasing size of passenger vehicles has been catastrophic for road safety, traffic congestion, climate viability, and household budgets.' Komanoff opposes SUV and pickup proliferation and supports downsizing, electrification, and policies like road pricing and better transit. He stresses that larger vehicles are far more likely to kill other road users. He argues that electrification and smaller cars alone cannot cut emissions or deaths enough. Only less driving, paired with systemic changes—congestion pricing, curb pricing, and livable streets—will protect the vulnerable and the climate. No council bill is attached, but the warning is clear: car bloat endangers everyone outside the vehicle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and pedestrians remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>Bill creating the Commercial Waste Zone program, sponsored by Antonio Reynoso, passed in 2019 after deadly crashes involving private haulers. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) announced on January 31, 2024, that only one of twenty zones—Jackson Heights, Corona, Elmhurst—will launch this year. The law aims to cut truck miles in half, add backup cameras, GPS, and safety training. DSNY spokesperson Joshua Goodman said contracts target safety and worker protections. Reynoso urged ongoing oversight, saying, 'It is important that DSNY continuously reassess implementation and course correct as needed.' Yet, delays persist, especially on installing guard rails to prevent pedestrians and cyclists from being swept under trucks. Justin Wood of NYLPI voiced concern over the slow rollout. The program promises fewer trucks and safer streets, but for now, most neighborhoods wait.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation and NYPD cleared all souvenir stands and food sellers at midnight. A sign now reads, 'No vending allowed.' Councilmember Gale A. Brewer, District 6, was mentioned for introducing a related bill last month to restrict sales only on narrow sections. Mayor Eric Adams said, 'Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety.' The ban aims to improve pedestrian flow on the crowded bridge, which sees over 34,000 walkers on a fall weekend. Supporters of vendors mourned the loss of affordable food and art. Tourists welcomed the extra space and easier passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
