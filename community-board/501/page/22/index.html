His name was Nacere Ellis. He died from head trauma after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The driver stayed at the scene. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported</a> the NYPD is still investigating.</p><p>A week later, a 13-year-old boy on a moped collided with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. It was 1 a.m. He left the street in critical condition, a head injury sending him to Richmond University Medical Center. The bus driver and passengers walked away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7 wrote</a> nothing about what led up to the crash. Only the boy’s fate made the news.</p><p>Since 2022, <strong>18 people have died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>30 more suffered serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, workers. The numbers keep rising. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The dead and injured are not numbers. They are neighbors. In the last 12 months alone, 5 people died and 13 were seriously hurt. Children under 18 made up about one in eight of the injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>5 deaths and 3 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all left their mark. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The silence from local leaders is loud. Senator Andrew Lanza voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to curb repeat speeders, a measure that could have forced the most dangerous drivers to slow down. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted no</a> even as the bodies piled up. Assembly Member Charles Fall voted <strong>yes</strong> to extend school speed zones, a small step for child safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>He did his part</a>.

The law hits the vulnerable hardest.

Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people first. The dead cannot speak.

The pause endangers New Yorkers who rely on safe streets.</p><p class=mb3>On August 2, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul publicly defended her June 5 decision to 'pause' New York’s congestion pricing law. Speaking at a Colorado think tank, Hochul insisted, 'Pause is a pause until I say it's not a pause.' She urged the state legislature to address the $15-billion MTA funding shortfall, stating, 'The legislature has to come back and find a solution.' Congestion pricing, passed in 2019, was designed to fund transit and reduce deadly traffic. Critics, including transit advocates and policy experts, challenged Hochul’s authority and accuracy, noting her claims about economic hardship and London’s tolls were misleading. Hochul’s unilateral move leaves the law in limbo and threatens the future of safe, reliable transit for millions of New Yorkers. No council members were directly involved in this executive action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jeremy Cooney, new chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, issued a public demand for Governor Hochul to deliver a '100-day plan' to replace the $16.5 billion MTA funding shortfall caused by her cancellation of congestion pricing. In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of funding jeopardizes projects vital to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders, workers, and streets pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, Governor Hochul’s official pause on congestion pricing triggered a $12 billion loss in MTA contracts, according to a Reinvent Albany report. The move slashes funding for the 2020-24 MTA capital plan, which was to be partly paid by congestion pricing. The report highlights that many companies losing contracts are in districts represented by lawmakers who either support the pause or have stayed silent. Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick called congestion pricing 'simply another tax' and demanded repeal. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow praised the pause, saying it allows time to address 'communities' concerns.' Frank Russo, president of Ozone Park Lumber, warned, 'You can't just say, 'We're not going to buy supplies and equipment.'' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany said, 'Congestion pricing is an economic booster.' The pause means less money for transit, fewer jobs, and more risk for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, reliable public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The action, detailed in 'Disabled NYer’s are Victims of Gov. Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Pause,' leaves tens of thousands without access. Michelle Alcaraz and Ray Ray, both disabled New Yorkers, are forced to travel far from home or avoid transit altogether. The MTA’s $16 billion in scheduled repairs, including crucial accessibility upgrades, is now in limbo. Joe Rappaport of the Brooklyn Center for the Independence of the Disabled called on the governor and legislature to restore funding, warning that the lack of elevators treats disabled riders as 'second-class citizens.' The pause keeps stations dangerous for parents, caregivers, and the disabled.

The plan, discussed before the Community Board, would add a bus lane and a protected bike lane. DOT calls the corridor a Vision Zero Priority Corridor, citing 430 injuries from 2019 to 2023, including deaths and serious harm to cyclists and pedestrians. DOT's Rosy Doud said, 'We’re really seeing a need here to make some safety improvements.' Board member Kenneth Crouch supported protected lanes, while Chair Jose Altamirano pushed to limit parking loss. Delivery worker Naquan described drivers 'always trying to run me off the road.'

Hoylman-Sigal supports lowering the toll, saying, 'The goal should be mend it don’t end it.' He urges keeping the program alive to save mass transit. Sen. Liz Krueger is open to tweaks if goals are met. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow opposes any revival. The MTA faces a $15 billion shortfall after the program’s pause.
