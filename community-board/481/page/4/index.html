The roads move fast. People don’t.</p><h3 id=the-expressways-take-the-most>The expressways take the most</h3><p>Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck are where bodies break. In this board, they account for the biggest toll. One crash on the Van Wyck on Dec 3, 2024, killed a 41‑year‑old man on foot, with alcohol listed as a factor, far from any corner <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Another crash on the Grand Central left a motorcyclist injured after a lane change at dawn on Jul 18, 2025 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. A 53‑year‑old on a moped was badly hurt at Jewel Avenue and the parkway in May 2025 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>The board’s hotspot list is led by these corridors: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Grand Central Parkway</a> and the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Van Wyck Expressway</a>. Roosevelt Avenue shows repeated hurt too <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=when-it-hits-hardest>When it hits hardest</h3><p>The clock tells its own story. Injury peaks around the afternoon push and into night. The 3 PM hour leads with 56 injuries. Late night doesn’t spare anyone: 20 injuries at 8 PM; 48 at 8 PM; 45 at midnight; 43 at 11 PM <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Deaths show up at 11 AM, 4 PM, and midnight in this slice <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Most harm falls on car occupants. But people outside the car pay the price. In this area since 2022: pedestrians suffered two deaths and 20 injuries; people on bikes were hurt nine times, with two serious injuries. Another four serious injuries hit riders on other small devices <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=causes-we-can-name>Causes we can name</h3><p>Inattention sits on the reports. So does failure to yield and bad turns. Alcohol shows up too. The dataset tallies four deaths tied to “other” factors and 28 injuries there; distraction links to more harm; failure to yield and improper turns keep adding to the count <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Dec 1, 2022, speed killed a teen in a BMW on the Long Island Expressway. She was ejected. The car was “demolished.” Unsafe speed is on the record <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-hitandrun-that-tells-the-truth>The hit‑and‑run that tells the truth</h3><p>Just after 2:30 AM on Aug 13, 2025, a driver struck a 52‑year‑old man near South Conduit Avenue by JFK and fled. Police said, “The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man.” No arrest that day <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>. Another outlet wrote: “The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>NY Daily News</a>. Gothamist noted detectives were looking for the car and counted 17 traffic deaths in Queens South this year through Aug 10 <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>One line stands out in another Queens case, a wrong‑way spree on the Clearview Expressway. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way,” the Queens DA said. Two motorists were badly hurt and “still have not fully recovered.” Lee told police: “I entered the Clearview Expressway in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people and I felt ‘liberated’ by what I had done” <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=the-map-inside-this-district>The map inside this district</h3><p>Roosevelt Avenue. People on foot and on bikes. Serious injuries there. A line in the data that does not go away <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Grand Central. Van Wyck. Long Island Expressway. Numbers stack on ramps and merge lanes <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-what-we-can-see>Fix what we can see</h3><p>Make turns slow at Roosevelt with hardened corners and daylighting. Add leading pedestrian intervals where walkers actually cross. On the expressway fronts, shield service roads, add refuge where people cross mid‑block, and tighten access points. Target the peak hours with enforcement for failure to yield, speeding, and distraction on the corridors that show the most harm <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-that-cut-the-blood-loss>Citywide tools that cut the blood loss</h3><p>Albany gave the city power to set safer speeds. The city can lower the default. The safest move is to slow the whole grid. Cameras now run 24/7 in school zones through 2030; repeat violators still slip through. The state’s speed‑limiter bill advanced in June 2025 to curb the worst offenders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S4045</a>. Our own guide explains why lower limits and speed limiters save lives, and how to push them now <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><h3 id=what-lingers>What lingers</h3><p>Two pedestrian deaths in this board since 2022. A man on the Van Wyck. A man near JFK. The report says “apparent death.” The road stays open <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The street remembers the impact.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on May 2, 2025, that Michael Peña, a former FDNY probationary firefighter, was released on $75,000 bail after a deadly Queens crash. Police allege Peña was 'drunk and high on cocaine and marijuana' and speeding at 83 mph when he 'ran a red light and T-boned a car driven by 24-year-old Justin Diaz.' The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions. Peña faces manslaughter and other charges, with a possible 15-year sentence if convicted. The case highlights the lethal risk of impaired, reckless driving and the limits of pretrial detention policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
