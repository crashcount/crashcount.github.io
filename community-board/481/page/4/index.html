Seven left with injuries so severe they may never heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, 220 people have been hurt in 267 crashes. One death. One life erased. One family changed forever.</p><p>Last week, an MTA bus jumped the curb at 57th Road and Main Street. Eight people were hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; But after reviewing the video, officials now believe he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. The crash nearly took out two people waiting at the stop. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo;</a> said Samantha Hart, a bystander. The sidewalk is not safe. The bus stop is not safe. The street is not safe.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price><strong>Who Pays the Price?</strong></h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm.</strong> In the past three years, SUVs killed one person and left eleven more with injuries. Trucks and buses caused more pain. One truck left a cyclist with an amputated arm. A single bike crash left a pedestrian hurt. The toll is not just numbers. It is blood on the street, a body on the curb, a life cut short.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-next-fight><strong>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Next Fight</strong></h3><p>Senator John Liu voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act. The bill would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. It passed committee in June. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Liu voted yes to curb repeat speeders.</a> But the law is not yet on the books. Assembly Member Sam Berger missed the vote to extend school speed zones. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h3 id=what-now><strong>What Now?</strong></h3><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them to finish the job. Lower the speed limit. Pass the law. Protect the sidewalk. Do not wait for another bus to jump the curb. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>Demand action. Demand safety. Demand it now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
