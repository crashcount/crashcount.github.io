Adams’s aides halt bus lanes, bike paths, pedestrian zones. Projects stall at political whim. DOT morale drops. Vulnerable road users wait. Streets stay deadly. Bureaucracy wins. Safety loses.</p><p class=mb3>On October 17, 2022, Streetsblog NYC reported that City Hall, under Mayor Adams, is obstructing key street safety projects. The article, titled 'A NIMBY City Hall: Adams Appointees Thwart Key Bike and Bus Projects,' details how the Mayor’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA) delays or blocks bus lanes, bike lanes, Citi Bike expansion, and pedestrianization. Appointees Tiffany Raspberry and Menashe Shapiro, both lacking transportation backgrounds, are named as obstacles. Council Members Francisco Moya, Bob Holden, and Oswald Feliz, all Adams allies, have influenced these delays. DOT officials describe a new layer of bureaucracy: 'The threshold for stopping any single project, it’s almost nonexistent.' Projects like Northern Boulevard bus lanes and Fordham Road improvements are on hold. DOT morale is low. The city’s promise of $904 million for street safety is undermined by political interference. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as progress stalls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to require every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter, and other legal motorized vehicle to be registered with the Department of Transportation and display a visible license plate. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.' Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections. The streets stayed dangerous. The cars kept their edge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

The matter, covered in the article 'Critics slam Eric Adams’ Albany efforts on NYC priorities,' highlights City Hall’s inconsistent lobbying as the legislative session neared its end. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez was sent to push for stalled camera legislation, but lawmakers like State Sen. John Liu said the mayor’s direct engagement was lacking. Andrea Stewart-Cousins, mentioned in the coverage, is a key Albany figure. The bill’s fate remains uncertain. If the cameras expire, enforcement near schools vanishes, exposing pedestrians and cyclists to greater risk.
