The system failed the victim, not the driver.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on May 20, 2025, that a doorbell camera recorded an Amazon delivery truck striking a parked car in Queens and leaving the scene. The owner, Jose DeAguiar, described, "He rams right into the side of the car." The driver exited, inspected the damage, then left without leaving a note. Despite clear video evidence, DeAguiar spent three months seeking accountability as insurers denied responsibility. Only after ABC7's intervention did Amazon respond, covering $6,000 in repairs and $5,000 in storage fees.
