A car does not stop. In Queens CB81, the story repeats. <strong>In the last twelve months, 1 person died and 225 were injured in 248 crashes.</strong> One was a cyclist, his arm torn off by a truck. Another was a pedestrian, his head split open by an SUV. These are not numbers. They are lives cut short, bodies broken, families left to wait for a voice that will never answer.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Speed and distraction kill.</strong> In one crash, a driver ran a red light at 83 mph, drunk and high, and struck a man with the right-of-way.

Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine.

At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff. This is basic transit maintenance.” Liu said losing congestion pricing would erase a billion dollars in annual MTA revenue, threatening $15 billion in planned upgrades. The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily. Both officials opposed the repeal, highlighting the risk to the city’s transit backbone. The bill is not numbered, but the threat is clear: without congestion pricing, the city’s streets and subways grow more dangerous for everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
