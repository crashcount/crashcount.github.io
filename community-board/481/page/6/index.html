Seven left with injuries so severe they may never heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, 220 people have been hurt in 267 crashes. One death. One life erased. One family changed forever.</p><p>Last week, an MTA bus jumped the curb at 57th Road and Main Street. Eight people were hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; But after reviewing the video, officials now believe he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. The crash nearly took out two people waiting at the stop. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo;</a> said Samantha Hart, a bystander. The sidewalk is not safe. The bus stop is not safe. The street is not safe.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price><strong>Who Pays the Price?</strong></h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm.</strong> In the past three years, SUVs killed one person and left eleven more with injuries. Trucks and buses caused more pain. One truck left a cyclist with an amputated arm. A single bike crash left a pedestrian hurt. The toll is not just numbers. It is blood on the street, a body on the curb, a life cut short.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-next-fight><strong>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Next Fight</strong></h3><p>Senator John Liu voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act. The bill would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. It passed committee in June. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Liu voted yes to curb repeat speeders.</a> But the law is not yet on the books. Assembly Member Sam Berger missed the vote to extend school speed zones. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h3 id=what-now><strong>What Now?</strong></h3><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them to finish the job. Lower the speed limit. Pass the law. Protect the sidewalk. Do not wait for another bus to jump the curb. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>Demand action. Demand safety. Demand it now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Riders and vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On February 2, 2025, NYC officials responded to reports of a federal move to repeal congestion pricing, just weeks after its January 5 launch. At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff. This is basic transit maintenance.” Liu said losing congestion pricing would erase a billion dollars in annual MTA revenue, threatening $15 billion in planned upgrades. The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily. Both officials opposed the repeal, highlighting the risk to the city’s transit backbone. The bill is not numbered, but the threat is clear: without congestion pricing, the city’s streets and subways grow more dangerous for everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Storefronts fill up. Pedestrians and cyclists bring life and cash. Cars do not. Vacancy rates drop where traffic is banned. Volunteers keep these corridors alive, but city support lags behind their success.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2024, the Department of City Planning released a report titled 'Storefront Activity in NYC Neighborhoods.' The analysis, covered by Streetsblog NYC, finds that open streets—car-free corridors—have about half the vacant storefronts of car-filled streets. The report states: 'vibrant public spaces are key to the success of local businesses.' City officials like Ya-Ting Liu, chief public realm officer, and volunteers such as Alex Morano and Brent Bovenzi, praised the program's impact. Bovenzi noted, 'the program is shrinking because too much of the burden falls upon volunteer labor.' The Open Streets program, now permanent, covers over 130 locations but relies heavily on volunteers. Advocates urge the city to invest more, as the data shows people-centric design drives economic recovery and safer, more vibrant neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
