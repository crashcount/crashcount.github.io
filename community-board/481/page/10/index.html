Cyclists and pedestrians lose a safe route. Lawmakers backed the plan. The veto leaves vulnerable road users with dirt paths and danger. The greenway remains unfinished.</p><p class=mb3>On November 20, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul vetoed a bill that would have required the state Department of Parks and Recreation and the Office of Mental Health to study expanding the Vanderbilt Motor Parkway greenway into Nassau County. The bill passed both the state Senate and Assembly unanimously. The matter summary called for a study to extend the greenway, which runs parallel to the hazardous Union Turnpike. State Senator John Liu sponsored the bill and vowed to keep pushing for the project, saying, 'I’m confident we’ll get there.' Hochul’s veto cited budget concerns and the risk of 'duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy.' Advocates like Joby Jacob called the veto a blow to years of organizing, noting that people are forced to walk dirt paths where sidewalks should be. The veto blocks progress on a safer route for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled "City Traffic Helps Make Bus Service Unbearable, Expensive And Difficult To Improve," highlights how traffic congestion, double-parking, and outdated routes cripple bus efficiency. State Sen. John Liu urges more service in neighborhoods where buses can move. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says, "With better service, the path to more service is a much clearer one." ABLE cameras have improved bus speeds by 5 percent on enforced routes. Despite promises, Mayor Eric Adams has not delivered on expanding bus lanes.

The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers. Assembly Member Grace Lee said, 'They should be exempt from tolls under the congestion pricing plan.'

Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.
