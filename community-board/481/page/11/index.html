A car does not stop. In Queens CB81, the story repeats. <strong>In the last twelve months, 1 person died and 225 were injured in 248 crashes.</strong> One was a cyclist, his arm torn off by a truck. Another was a pedestrian, his head split open by an SUV. These are not numbers. They are lives cut short, bodies broken, families left to wait for a voice that will never answer.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Speed and distraction kill.</strong> In one crash, a driver ran a red light at 83 mph, drunk and high, and struck a man with the right-of-way.

The announcement, made at One Police Plaza, highlighted the bill sponsored by Simon and Sen. John Liu. The matter summary states, 'Officials called on Albany to pass legislation to lower the BAC threshold to .05%, arguing it would reduce DWI fatalities by about 10% and align with other countries.' Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany.

Fresh pavement replaces potholes. Cyclists and pedestrians gain wider, dedicated lanes. Cars lose ground. Officials call it a pilot for city parks. If it works, Central Park could be next.</p><p class=mb3>On March 8, 2023, city officials announced a major redesign of Prospect Park’s East Drive. The project, not tied to a specific council bill, begins March 12 and is billed as an 18-month pilot. The main loop’s eastern stretch will be repaved and repainted, giving cyclists a 16-to-18-foot shared lane with authorized vehicles, flanked by two pedestrian lanes up to 14 feet wide. The city rejected a two-bike-lane alternative, citing pedestrian access needs. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie praised the upgrade, calling Prospect Park a treasure. Chief Public Realm Officer Ya-Ting Liu said, 'Re-examining how we design the roads in our park system is a perfect example of how we’re advancing the Mayor’s vision for quality public spaces throughout the city.' Officials stress the park is closed to private vehicles. The redesign aims to set a new standard for park safety and access across New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
