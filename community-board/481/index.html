Buses crawl at four miles per hour. New lanes promise relief for 215,000 riders. Space shifts from cars to buses. Streets change. Riders wait.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-07-08) reports new bus lanes are coming to Hillside Avenue, Queens. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the corridor suffers from 'an inconsistent, patchwork design' and blocked lanes. Buses crawl at four miles per hour due to congestion. Only a third of road space serves buses, though 83% of transit users ride them. The project adds camera-enforced bus lanes, parking, and loading zones. Policy shifts road space from private cars to public transit, aiming to speed up service for 215,000 daily riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
