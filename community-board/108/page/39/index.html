Status: Delayed. Committee: Not specified. Key dates: Announced 2020, stalled as of April 8, 2022. The project, described as a 'car-free busway between 57th and 34th streets,' aimed to speed up commutes for 110,000 bus riders. Council Member Keith Powers pressed DOT for updates, saying, 'we shouldn’t miss a big opportunity to transform Fifth Avenue.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance called it 'one of the most important busways in the City.' Despite proven success elsewhere, business interests stalled progress. The current plan offers a protected bike lane and pedestrian improvements, but no dedicated bus lane. DOT has not provided a timeline. Advocates and local officials remain frustrated. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, cyclists, pedestrians—are left exposed as the city delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
