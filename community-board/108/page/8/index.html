A yellow cab made a U-turn and struck her. Moments later, a second car hit her. She died at the hospital. Both drivers stayed. No charges. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said.</a></p><p>A Tesla sped down the FDR, hit the guardrail, flipped, and burned. The driver died. The passenger survived. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>In three and a half years, <strong>11 people have died</strong> on these streets. <strong>44 more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers keep rising.</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are the first to bleed. In the last year, two people over 75 died. Children were hurt. The old, the young, the ones who walk—these are the bodies left behind. Cars and SUVs killed four. Trucks killed two. Bikes and mopeds left their mark, but the weight of steel does most of the damage.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>City Hall talks of Vision Zero. They say, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> But the dead keep coming. The city has the power now to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. Speed cameras work, but Albany lets their future hang by a thread. The law could expire. The cameras could go dark. The city builds new bike lanes and claims progress, but the blood on the crosswalks says otherwise.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its power. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

And the good news on the research is theater has not come down since congestion pricing has started. Restaurants have not come down. There are more people on the streets." -- Liz Krueger</p><p class=mb3>On May 8, 2025, the New York State Legislature passed Gov. Hochul’s $254-billion budget after heated debate. The bill, debated in the Senate Finance and Transportation Committees, included $6 billion for MTA capital improvements and supported congestion pricing. Sen. Dean Murray (R-Suffolk) and Sen. Bill Weber (R-Rockland) opposed the measure, citing toll burdens and limited transit options. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) and Transportation Chair Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester) defended the plan, highlighting increased MTA revenue and minimal impact on local businesses. The matter summary reads: 'State legislators from the suburbs, particularly Republican lawmakers, voiced strong opposition to congestion pricing during the passage of Gov. Hochul's $254-billion budget in Albany.' The budget passed 40-22, mostly along party lines. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New laws demand brighter lights, stricter deadlines, and design upgrades. Council Members Powers and Bottcher drive the push. The city aims to reclaim sidewalks from decades of dark, lingering scaffolding.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2025, the City Council passed and Mayor Eric Adams signed a five-bill package to overhaul sidewalk shed and scaffolding rules. The bills—Intro. 393-A, 391-A, 394-A (sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers), and Intro. 660-A, 661-A (sponsored by Council Member Erik Bottcher)—cut shed permit durations from one year to three months, double required lighting, and impose new penalties for delays. The matter summary states: 'New laws are set to finally tackle the scourge of unsightly sidewalk construction sheds and scaffolding structures around the city.' Powers said, 'This package of legislation puts forward reforms to fundamentally change our approach to scaffolding while ensuring safety is still the top priority.' Bottcher added, 'It’s time we cut back the endless sidewalk sheds that block our light.' The reforms target over 400 miles of lingering scaffolding, aiming to restore light and space to city sidewalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
