Since 2022, the board area logged <strong>12 deaths</strong> and more than a thousand injuries. In the last 12 months alone: <strong>4 dead, 554 injured</strong>. The line keeps rising.</p><h3 id=york-and-68th-a-walk-signal-then-a-body>York and 68th: a walk signal, then a body</h3><p>A 71‑year‑old woman entered the crosswalk at York and East 68th with the signal. An SUV driver turned right and hit her. She died. The crash report lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows the case as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4664179</a> and places it at the intersection.</p><p>At York and East 87th, a 30‑year‑old woman died at the intersection in 2024. Multiple cars were moving through. The record lists her as a pedestrian with “Apparent Death.” See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4714580</a>.</p><p>A 90‑year‑old woman was struck near York and East 72nd in February. The report notes she was crossing with no signal or crosswalk and lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” She died. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4790720</a>.</p><h3 id=fdr-drive-speed-and-steel>FDR Drive: speed and steel</h3><p>On the FDR, a driver died in a demolished 2020 sedan after an overnight crash. The report says “Unsafe Speed.” The victim is listed as ejected with “Apparent Death.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4790343</a>.</p><p>The board’s worst locations tell the same story. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>FDR Drive</a> leads with 3 deaths and 336 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Second Avenue</a> follows with 2 deaths and 67 injuries.

Since 2022 here: pedestrians, <strong>6 dead and 388 injured</strong>; cyclists, <strong>2 dead and 332 injured</strong>. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage to people on foot. In the pedestrian roll‑up, SUVs lead, tied to <strong>4 deaths</strong> and over a hundred injuries; sedans follow. Trucks and buses are fewer but still deadly.

The vague label does not soften the outcome.

Advocates warned most of the corridor “will remain deadly.” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>. NY1 reported the city would add barriers and lower speeds at that site after the crash. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</p><p>Uptown, the state Senate moved a bill to force chronic speeders to slow down. Committee votes advanced a measure requiring intelligent speed assistance after repeated violations. Sen. Liz Krueger voted yes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, congestion pricing — a tool that cuts car trips and pays for transit — sits paused. The hardware stands idle. “They should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown,” Council Member Keith Powers said in coverage of the pause. <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>NY Post</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-this-ground-not-the-press-release>Fix this ground, not the press release</h3><p>Start where people die. Daylight the corners on York and Second. Harden the turns. Give leading pedestrian intervals and keep them. Build protected space, continuous, on the east side avenues. On the FDR frontage, narrow entries and slow the ramps. Target repeat hot spots with 24/7 camera enforcement and signal timing that favors walkers.</p><p>Then go citywide. <strong>Lower the default speed limit to 20 mph</strong> under Sammy’s Law. <strong>Force repeat speeders to use speed limiters</strong>. Albany gave the city tools. The Senate has moved the limiter bill. These are not theories. They are choices.</p><p>Do not wait for another body. Act: <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) briefed Manhattan Community Board 1 on the plan, which aims to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists in the Financial District. The project, funded by $500,000 from then-Council Member Margaret Chin, remains in the study phase, delayed by the pandemic. DOT Project Manager Jenny Leung said the city is updating conditions and planning stakeholder engagement. Community Board 1 and the Financial District Neighborhood Association (FDNA) have backed the plan since 2015 and 2016, respectively. FDNA Board Member Catherine Hughes pressed for urgency, saying, 'It's time for a pilot project now.' Business leader Jessica Lappin voiced logistical concerns. The plan envisions shared streets with 5 mph speed limits and a future pedestrian plaza. Progress is slow. The city’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
