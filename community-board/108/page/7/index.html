A yellow cab made a U-turn and struck her. Moments later, a second car hit her. She died at the hospital. Both drivers stayed. No charges. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said.</a></p><p>A Tesla sped down the FDR, hit the guardrail, flipped, and burned. The driver died. The passenger survived. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>In three and a half years, <strong>11 people have died</strong> on these streets. <strong>44 more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers keep rising.</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are the first to bleed. In the last year, two people over 75 died. Children were hurt. The old, the young, the ones who walk—these are the bodies left behind. Cars and SUVs killed four. Trucks killed two. Bikes and mopeds left their mark, but the weight of steel does most of the damage.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>City Hall talks of Vision Zero. They say, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> But the dead keep coming. The city has the power now to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. Speed cameras work, but Albany lets their future hang by a thread. The law could expire. The cameras could go dark. The city builds new bike lanes and claims progress, but the blood on the crosswalks says otherwise.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its power. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled "MTA eyes new taxes, fees to plug $33B budget hole — even after NYC’s $9 congestion toll!", landed in the spotlight after the new toll failed to close the gap. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, district 35, formally objected to the unfunded capital plan with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. Their joint letter blocked the plan’s January 1 start, forcing negotiations. Governor Hochul, who backs the $68 billion plan, promised no income tax hikes but left other taxes and fees on the table. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called for transparency. The MTA’s future—and the safety of those who rely on it—hangs in the balance.

The article states, “A wrong-way driver fleeing from police struck a bicyclist in Greenwich Village during a chase.” The suspect, pursued on foot by officers, entered a black sedan and hit the cyclist before escaping. Emergency services brought the 44-year-old victim to Bellevue Hospital; he survived. The suspect remains at large. The piece notes a sharp rise in injuries from police pursuits: 398 crashes and 315 injuries in the first eleven months of 2024, up 47% from the previous year. The NYPD is revising its pursuit policy after ten deaths in cases where “no drugs or guns were found.”</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No easy answers.</p><p class=mb3>Intro. 606, known as Priscilla’s Law, was introduced by Council Member Robert F. Holden of District 30. The bill, debated on December 12, 2024, sits before the City Council. It would require all e-mobility devices not covered by the state DMV to register with the city’s Department of Transportation. The bill’s summary states it aims to increase accountability for e-bike riders after fatal crashes. Holden, the sponsor, cited dangers from unregulated e-vehicles and hit-and-runs. Advocacy groups, including Los Deliveristas Unidos and Open Plans, argue the bill would unfairly criminalize immigrants and delivery workers, and increase police stops for people of color. The NYC Hospitality Alliance warns of new financial and administrative burdens for small businesses. Both sides agree cars cause far more deaths, but the bill’s critics say better street design, not registration, would protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan aims to shrink shed sprawl, speed up repairs, and reclaim public space. Residents lose sunlight and safety to these hulking structures. The council moves to change that.</p><p class=mb3>Bill details: City Council legislative proposal on sidewalk shed reform, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers (District 4) and others. The bill is under council review as of December 10, 2024. The measure seeks to overhaul regulations that force NYCHA to keep up over 400 sidewalk sheds—spanning 25 miles—often long after repairs finish. The matter summary states, 'reforming parts of the city’s broader shedding regulations that are a poor fit for NYCHA and a nuisance citywide.' Powers and co-sponsor Erik Bottcher aim to reduce shed length, extend inspection cycles, and allow more art and color on scaffolds. Jamie Rubin, NYCHA board head, supports the bill, noting that current rules rob residents of sunlight, safety, and outdoor space. The bill promises to remove unnecessary sheds, reclaim millions in wasted funds, and improve daily life for public housing residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others.
