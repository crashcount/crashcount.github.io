Twelve left with life-changing injuries. In the last twelve months, Manhattan CB8 saw 1,127 crashes—more than three a day. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just last week, eight people were hurt when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue. The cause is still unknown. No charges have been filed. The news reported, &ldquo;Eight people were hurt in the crash. All of the injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening.&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>ABC7</a></p><p>Days before, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled, drove onto the sidewalk, and later confessed. He told police he fled because he did not have a license. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a> The cyclist was left in critical condition.</p><p>The victims are old and young. In the last year, two people over 75 were killed. Eighteen children were injured. The numbers do not stop. They only climb.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>SUVs and cars do the most harm. They caused four deaths and nearly 300 injuries to people walking or biking. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds left more than a dozen hurt. Bikes injured 42, but killed no one. The street is not equal. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. State Senator Liz Krueger voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a> Assembly Member Rebecca Seawright co-sponsored a similar bill in the Assembly. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">Open States</a> But the carnage continues. Enforcement is weak. Cameras catch speeders, but the city has not lowered the default speed limit. Promises are made. The dead stay dead.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, and those who look away. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

New laws demand brighter lights, stricter deadlines, and design upgrades. Council Members Powers and Bottcher drive the push. The city aims to reclaim sidewalks from decades of dark, lingering scaffolding.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2025, the City Council passed and Mayor Eric Adams signed a five-bill package to overhaul sidewalk shed and scaffolding rules. The bills—Intro. 393-A, 391-A, 394-A (sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers), and Intro. 660-A, 661-A (sponsored by Council Member Erik Bottcher)—cut shed permit durations from one year to three months, double required lighting, and impose new penalties for delays. The matter summary states: 'New laws are set to finally tackle the scourge of unsightly sidewalk construction sheds and scaffolding structures around the city.' Powers said, 'This package of legislation puts forward reforms to fundamentally change our approach to scaffolding while ensuring safety is still the top priority.' Bottcher added, 'It’s time we cut back the endless sidewalk sheds that block our light.' The reforms target over 400 miles of lingering scaffolding, aiming to restore light and space to city sidewalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver crashed at Dyckman Street and Henry Hudson Parkway. The car burst into flames. The officers left the scene and did not report the crash, later returning to their precinct and finishing their shift. Surveillance footage captured their patrol car leaving. Both officers have been suspended. The article notes, 'Both officers have been suspended as the NYPD's Force Investigation Division investigates their actions.' The crash comes after NYPD restricted police pursuits, limiting them to cases involving felonies or violent misdemeanors. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the department now relies on 'advanced tools of modern-day policing' instead of risky chases. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about the dangers of police pursuits and the need for strict adherence to new policies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
