Since 2022 here: pedestrians, <strong>6 dead and 388 injured</strong>; cyclists, <strong>2 dead and 332 injured</strong>. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage to people on foot. In the pedestrian roll‑up, SUVs lead, tied to <strong>4 deaths</strong> and over a hundred injuries; sedans follow. Trucks and buses are fewer but still deadly.

Advocates warned most of the corridor “will remain deadly.” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>. NY1 reported the city would add barriers and lower speeds at that site after the crash. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</p><p>Uptown, the state Senate moved a bill to force chronic speeders to slow down. Committee votes advanced a measure requiring intelligent speed assistance after repeated violations. Sen. Liz Krueger voted yes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, congestion pricing — a tool that cuts car trips and pays for transit — sits paused. The hardware stands idle. “They should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown,” Council Member Keith Powers said in coverage of the pause. <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>NY Post</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-this-ground-not-the-press-release>Fix this ground, not the press release</h3><p>Start where people die. Daylight the corners on York and Second. Harden the turns. Give leading pedestrian intervals and keep them. Build protected space, continuous, on the east side avenues. On the FDR frontage, narrow entries and slow the ramps. Target repeat hot spots with 24/7 camera enforcement and signal timing that favors walkers.</p><p>Then go citywide. <strong>Lower the default speed limit to 20 mph</strong> under Sammy’s Law. <strong>Force repeat speeders to use speed limiters</strong>. Albany gave the city tools. The Senate has moved the limiter bill. These are not theories. They are choices.</p><p>Do not wait for another body.

The bills—Intro. 393-A, 391-A, 394-A (sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers), and Intro. 660-A, 661-A (sponsored by Council Member Erik Bottcher)—cut shed permit durations from one year to three months, double required lighting, and impose new penalties for delays. The matter summary states: 'New laws are set to finally tackle the scourge of unsightly sidewalk construction sheds and scaffolding structures around the city.' Powers said, 'This package of legislation puts forward reforms to fundamentally change our approach to scaffolding while ensuring safety is still the top priority.' Bottcher added, 'It’s time we cut back the endless sidewalk sheds that block our light.' The reforms target over 400 miles of lingering scaffolding, aiming to restore light and space to city sidewalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
