Police crackdowns and ticket threats push them to comply. Advocates step in, guiding new immigrants through red tape. Sellers rarely warn buyers about legal requirements. Workers pay steep fees to keep earning and avoid losing their rides.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published February 21, 2024, details the surge in moped registrations among New York City delivery workers. DMV data show ZIP codes with many deliveristas now lead in registered mopeds. The article quotes workers like Junior Pichardo, who says, 'If you have plates, [the police] won’t summons you.' Eric Macario and William Medina, both delivery workers, highlight confusion and lack of information about registration and insurance. Medina blames sellers for failing to inform buyers. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores have introduced a bill to require sellers to register mopeds before sale, but it remains pending. For now, advocates help workers navigate the system. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project says many only learn the rules after police seize their mopeds or issue tickets. The crackdown exposes systemic gaps, leaving vulnerable workers to bear the cost and risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
