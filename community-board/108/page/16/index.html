The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.

Streets stay dangerous. The clock ticks.</p><p class=mb3>On June 8, 2024, New York’s congestion pricing program was paused indefinitely, leaving $500 million in installed infrastructure unused. The matter, titled "$500M of taxpayer dough wasted? Hochul, MTA lack Plan B for NYC congestion pricing infrastructure," highlights the lack of contingency plans from the MTA and Governor Hochul. Councilman Keith Powers (District 4), a supporter of congestion pricing, called for repurposing the equipment for red-light, speed, and noise camera enforcement, and tracking vehicles with fake or obscured plates. Critics, including Vito Fosella and Joe Borelli, questioned the process and future use of the equipment. The indefinite pause leaves the MTA’s capital projects unfunded and vulnerable road users exposed, as enforcement tools sit idle and no alternative safety measures are in place.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
