Cuomo lobbied city officials directly. The matter summary states, 'The lack of bike infrastructure is linked to the recent death of cyclist Carling Mott.' Despite Maloney's later claims of general support for protected bike lanes, her intervention helped kill this project. Current Council Member Keith Powers has shown interest in revisiting the plan.

The event, hosted by State Senator Liz Krueger, featured DOT Manhattan Borough Commissioner Ed Pincar, who said, “We are looking very closely… we may be able to present a proposal maybe even later this year.” The redesign aims to transform Third Avenue into a safer boulevard with fewer car lanes, more bus lanes, a separated bike path, and wider sidewalks. Council Member Gale Brewer and advocates like Paul Krikler have long demanded these changes. Krueger and the NYPD, however, focused on enforcement against cyclists and e-bike riders, citing constituent concerns. Krueger has previously pushed for harsher penalties for electric-vehicle riders. NYPD data shows more enforcement against cyclists than drivers, even though drivers cause most injuries.

They cite 429 injuries, four deaths. They want a corridor-wide plan, not scattered fixes. Business leaders now back the move. Recent crashes fuel urgency. The city promises action.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2022, Council Member Keith Powers (District 4) joined Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and Council Members Carlina Rivera and Erik Bottcher to urge the Department of Transportation to pedestrianize Broadway from 14th to 34th streets, with plans to extend up to 42nd Street. Their letter cites 429 injuries and four pedestrian deaths along Broadway between August 2011 and May 2022. The officials wrote, 'This stretch of Broadway needs to be made safer, and we believe pedestrianization, with limited necessary entries for vehicles that must access certain points along Broadway, could be a way to positively transform the area and benefit all New Yorkers.' Business leaders, including Dan Biederman of the 34th Street Partnership, now support the plan, calling it good for economic development. The push follows a recent taxi crash at Broadway and 29th Street that injured six.

They cite 429 injuries and four deaths from 14th to 42nd streets. They demand a real plan, not piecemeal fixes. The city’s slow pace angers them. Victims wait. Traffic keeps killing.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2022, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and Council Members Carlina Rivera, Erik Bottcher, and Keith Powers urged the Department of Transportation to declare Broadway from 14th to 34th streets a 'limited access open street.' They called for a comprehensive pedestrianization plan, referencing 429 injuries and four pedestrian deaths along the corridor since 2011. Their letter states, 'This stretch of Broadway needs to be made safer, and we believe pedestrianization... could be a way to positively transform the area.' The officials want a tangible plan by fall and concrete actions by early 2023. Business leaders, including Dan Biederman, now support the move, citing economic benefits. The recent taxi crash at Broadway and 29th, injuring six, has fueled urgency. The city’s Broadway Vision plan promises pedestrianization from Union Square to Columbus Circle, but advocates and victims’ families demand more, faster.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT drags its feet. Residents and business owners clash over urgency. The plan sits in study. Cyclists and pedestrians wait. The city’s slow pace keeps danger alive on narrow streets.</p><p class=mb3>This update covers the 'Make Way for Lower Manhattan' shared streets proposal, discussed July 1, 2022. The Department of Transportation (DOT) briefed Manhattan Community Board 1 on the plan, which aims to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists in the Financial District. The project, funded by $500,000 from then-Council Member Margaret Chin, remains in the study phase, delayed by the pandemic. DOT Project Manager Jenny Leung said the city is updating conditions and planning stakeholder engagement. Community Board 1 and the Financial District Neighborhood Association (FDNA) have backed the plan since 2015 and 2016, respectively. FDNA Board Member Catherine Hughes pressed for urgency, saying, 'It's time for a pilot project now.' Business leader Jessica Lappin voiced logistical concerns. The plan envisions shared streets with 5 mph speed limits and a future pedestrian plaza. Progress is slow. The city’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
