The Department of Transportation postponed converting the south outer roadway to a pedestrian-only path until December 2023, citing ongoing upper deck repairs. The matter, titled 'City punts fix for ‘treacherous’ Queensboro Bridge bike and pedestrian path by another year,' leaves cyclists and pedestrians sharing a dangerously tight path for another year. Councilmembers Julie Won and Julie Menin urged DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to speed up the process, calling the delay a safety concern. Cycling advocate Laura Shepard criticized the city for prioritizing drivers' comfort over vulnerable road users. DOT insists repairs must finish first.

The project, which would create a dedicated pedestrian path on the bridge’s south outer roadway, is now postponed until the end of 2023 due to deck fabrication issues. Council Members Julie Menin and Julie Won, responding to the delay, stated, 'At least two more years of a shared pedestrian and bike path is not the best outcome for our constituents.' Both called for a meeting with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, who reaffirmed his commitment to the project but offered no clear reason for the holdup. Advocates and community members condemned the delay as a threat to non-car users, citing frequent crashes and near-misses on the narrow shared path. They criticized the city’s prioritization of nine car lanes over the safety of cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation aims to cut vehicle lanes and expand the median between East 46th and 57th streets. The proposal, discussed in the council and supported by Powers, seeks to create more open, accessible public space. The matter summary calls it a 'shift toward a more pedestrian-friendly experience.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Danny Harris (Transportation Alternatives) urge the city to add a median-side bikeway and maximize pedestrian and green space. The project aligns with the NYC 25x25 plan to convert 25 percent of car space for people by 2025. Private interests, including the local Business Improvement District and Fisher Brothers, are helping fund the effort.

The plan, discussed in committee and supported by Council Member Keith Powers, aims to expand the median from 20 to 48 feet by removing one of three vehicle lanes. The project, described as a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' by Alfred Cerullo of the Grand Central Partnership, seeks to create more open, accessible public space for people and businesses in East Midtown. Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Danny Harris (Transportation Alternatives) urge the city to maximize space for people, calling for fully car-free stretches and a bike lane, since Park Avenue has no bus routes. The plan aligns with the NYC 25x25 initiative to convert 25% of car space to people space by 2025. Private commercial interests, including the local Business Improvement District and Fisher Brothers, are supporting and funding the project. The final design will be set by a landscape architect’s master plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
