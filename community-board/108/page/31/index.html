Since 2022 here: pedestrians, <strong>6 dead and 388 injured</strong>; cyclists, <strong>2 dead and 332 injured</strong>. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage to people on foot. In the pedestrian roll‑up, SUVs lead, tied to <strong>4 deaths</strong> and over a hundred injuries; sedans follow. Trucks and buses are fewer but still deadly.

Advocates warned most of the corridor “will remain deadly.” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>. NY1 reported the city would add barriers and lower speeds at that site after the crash. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</p><p>Uptown, the state Senate moved a bill to force chronic speeders to slow down. Committee votes advanced a measure requiring intelligent speed assistance after repeated violations. Sen. Liz Krueger voted yes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, congestion pricing — a tool that cuts car trips and pays for transit — sits paused. The hardware stands idle. “They should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown,” Council Member Keith Powers said in coverage of the pause. <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>NY Post</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-this-ground-not-the-press-release>Fix this ground, not the press release</h3><p>Start where people die. Daylight the corners on York and Second. Harden the turns. Give leading pedestrian intervals and keep them. Build protected space, continuous, on the east side avenues. On the FDR frontage, narrow entries and slow the ramps. Target repeat hot spots with 24/7 camera enforcement and signal timing that favors walkers.</p><p>Then go citywide. <strong>Lower the default speed limit to 20 mph</strong> under Sammy’s Law. <strong>Force repeat speeders to use speed limiters</strong>. Albany gave the city tools. The Senate has moved the limiter bill. These are not theories. They are choices.</p><p>Do not wait for another body.

The push follows prior years when two crosstown blocks were closed to cars to protect pedestrians. The matter, described as 'NYC pols push Eric Adams to bring back Rockefeller Center holiday street closures,' highlights the risk: 'The crowds are just enormous... it’s frankly unsafe to have tourists pushed off the sidewalk and stepping into traffic.' Powers and Levine sent a letter on November 1 but received no response. Powers said, 'The crowds are crushing and demand is overflowing.' Both officials support making the closures permanent to prevent pedestrians from being forced into traffic during peak tourist season.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates and officials back the move but call it timid. No wider sidewalks. No hardened protection. Paint and plastic mark the limits. Pedestrians and cyclists still face risk.</p><p class=mb3>On October 18, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation presented a redesign for Third Avenue, reviewed by Community Board 8's Transportation Committee. The plan, echoing a 2010 First Avenue project, repurposes 23 feet for cyclists and bus riders between E. 59th and E. 96th streets. Council Member Keith Powers and Borough President Mark Levine endorsed the proposal, with Levine stating, 'The redesign’s commitment to expanded protected bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes will turn this particularly dangerous stretch of the roadway into a safer, more efficient, and forward-thinking artery.' Still, Levine and advocates like Anna Melendez (Transportation Alternatives) pressed for more: wider sidewalks, hardened pedestrian islands, and real physical protection. The plan uses only paint and plastic, leaving pedestrians exposed. The proposal faces a full board vote on October 19, 2022. The city calls it a start, but the danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in the Board’s Transportation Committee, would convert two of five northbound car lanes into a dedicated bus lane and a parking-protected bike lane, with new pedestrian islands and signal priority. The committee voted 12-1 in favor. Councilmember Keith Powers, representing District 4, supports the overhaul. A spokesperson said, 'This project will expedite commute times, improve pedestrian safety, increase spaces for bikes, and ensure that cars, buses, and bikes can share the road in harmony.' Third Avenue is a Vision Zero priority corridor, scarred by six pedestrian and one cyclist death since 2016. Hundreds of cyclists ride here daily, despite no bike lane.

"We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely."" -- Liz Krueger</p><p class=mb3>On October 12, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) will unveil its Third Avenue redesign proposal to a Manhattan panel. The plan marks the Adams administration's first major street project. The current avenue, with seven northbound car lanes, has seen 703 crashes, one pedestrian death, and 198 injuries since 2019. The matter summary calls for 'reallocation of street space, prioritizing cycling, walking, and public transit over cars.' Advocates like Kate Fillin-Yeh (NACTO) and Paul Krikler (Community Board 8) urge protected bike lanes, busways, and wider sidewalks. Krikler says, 'We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely.' Transportation Alternatives and Community Board 6 echo these demands. The redesign aims to shift space from cars to people, following models like Paris's Rue de Rivoli. The panel's response will shape the future of vulnerable road user safety on Third Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Marijuana Regulation & Taxation Act passed in March 2021. The state now faces a gap: 'there are concerns of increased incidences of driving while impaired after cannabis use,' the Department of Health said. Senator Liz Krueger, a key architect, stated, 'Revenue from our legalized system will be used to pay these ongoing costs.' The Department of Health seeks new technology to detect cannabis impairment, as no standard test exists. Nearly 400 officers are trained as drug recognition experts, with thousands more in training. Critics warn DWI issues should have been solved before legalization. As enforcement lags, vulnerable road users face greater danger from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move follows a cyclist’s death on E. 85th. Advocates demanded action. The board, once resistant, now shifts toward safety for riders.</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 8 (CB8) voted 38-3 to request 'fully protected crosstown bike lanes approximately every 10 blocks between 60th and 110th streets on both sides of Central Park, and a two-way protected bikeway around Central Park.' The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition. Now, the board calls for comprehensive, protected infrastructure to shield vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution followed the death of 28-year-old cyclist Carling Mott, killed by a truck driver on E. 85th Street. The matter, described as a push to 'bring safe bike routes to the neighborhood,' saw support from councilmembers Keith Powers and Julie Menin, who called on DOT to revisit the 85th Street lane and improve safety infrastructure. Advocates and residents backed the plan, demanding action to prevent more deaths. DOT is reviewing the location for possible upgrades.
