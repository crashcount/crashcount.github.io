Introduced by Councilman Oswald Feliz (District 15) on November 27, 2022. The measure responds to at least 140 e-bike battery fires in 2022, with six deaths and 140 injuries. Feliz said, 'We must ensure that products sold in our city are safe for New Yorkers.' The bill restricts uncertified batteries and supports FDNY’s education campaign. The bulletin warns tenants about the dangers of charging and storing e-bike batteries at home. State Senator Liz Krueger also pushes for tighter battery regulations.
