A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>In three and a half years, <strong>11 people have died</strong> on these streets. <strong>44 more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers keep rising.</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are the first to bleed. In the last year, two people over 75 died. Children were hurt. The old, the young, the ones who walk—these are the bodies left behind. Cars and SUVs killed four. Trucks killed two. Bikes and mopeds left their mark, but the weight of steel does most of the damage.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>City Hall talks of Vision Zero. They say, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> But the dead keep coming. The city has the power now to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. Speed cameras work, but Albany lets their future hang by a thread. The law could expire. The cameras could go dark. The city builds new bike lanes and claims progress, but the blood on the crosswalks says otherwise.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its power. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, not tied to a specific council bill, follows years of complaints from cyclists about the unsafe grates. DOT spokesperson Tomas Garita said, 'We are actively exploring and testing various materials that will improve safety and the overall cycling experience for all its users.' The pilot covers 300 metal panels on each side of the bridge and adds new flexible delineators. Local advocate Paul Krikler credited former Council Members Ben Kallos and Jimmy Van Bramer, and current Council Member Julie Menin, for securing funding. Cyclist Conor Lyman said the old surface kept riders away. The project is expected to finish by Thanksgiving, finally addressing a long-standing threat to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, echoing a 2010 First Avenue project, repurposes 23 feet for cyclists and bus riders between E. 59th and E. 96th streets. Council Member Keith Powers and Borough President Mark Levine endorsed the proposal, with Levine stating, 'The redesign’s commitment to expanded protected bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes will turn this particularly dangerous stretch of the roadway into a safer, more efficient, and forward-thinking artery.' Still, Levine and advocates like Anna Melendez (Transportation Alternatives) pressed for more: wider sidewalks, hardened pedestrian islands, and real physical protection. The plan uses only paint and plastic, leaving pedestrians exposed. The proposal faces a full board vote on October 19, 2022. The city calls it a start, but the danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in the Board’s Transportation Committee, would convert two of five northbound car lanes into a dedicated bus lane and a parking-protected bike lane, with new pedestrian islands and signal priority. The committee voted 12-1 in favor. Councilmember Keith Powers, representing District 4, supports the overhaul. A spokesperson said, 'This project will expedite commute times, improve pedestrian safety, increase spaces for bikes, and ensure that cars, buses, and bikes can share the road in harmony.' Third Avenue is a Vision Zero priority corridor, scarred by six pedestrian and one cyclist death since 2016. Hundreds of cyclists ride here daily, despite no bike lane. Residents urged swift, bold action. DOT aims to install improvements in 2023.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seven lanes for cars have left little for walkers, cyclists, or bus riders. Since 2019: one pedestrian killed, 198 injured. Advocates demand fewer car lanes, protected bike paths, and wider sidewalks. Change is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On October 12, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) will unveil its Third Avenue redesign proposal to a Manhattan panel. The plan marks the Adams administration's first major street project. The current avenue, with seven northbound car lanes, has seen 703 crashes, one pedestrian death, and 198 injuries since 2019. The matter summary calls for 'reallocation of street space, prioritizing cycling, walking, and public transit over cars.' Advocates like Kate Fillin-Yeh (NACTO) and Paul Krikler (Community Board 8) urge protected bike lanes, busways, and wider sidewalks. Krikler says, 'We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely.' Transportation Alternatives and Community Board 6 echo these demands. The redesign aims to shift space from cars to people, following models like Paris's Rue de Rivoli. The panel's response will shape the future of vulnerable road user safety on Third Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users face new risks.</p><p class=mb3>On October 9, 2022, New York State, under Governor Hochul, accelerated cannabis legalization and opened retail shops. The Marijuana Regulation & Taxation Act passed in March 2021. The state now faces a gap: 'there are concerns of increased incidences of driving while impaired after cannabis use,' the Department of Health said. Senator Liz Krueger, a key architect, stated, 'Revenue from our legalized system will be used to pay these ongoing costs.' The Department of Health seeks new technology to detect cannabis impairment, as no standard test exists. Nearly 400 officers are trained as drug recognition experts, with thousands more in training. Critics warn DWI issues should have been solved before legalization. As enforcement lags, vulnerable road users face greater danger from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
