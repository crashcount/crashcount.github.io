A yellow cab made a U-turn and struck her. Moments later, a second car hit her. She died at the hospital. Both drivers stayed. No charges. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said.</a></p><p>A Tesla sped down the FDR, hit the guardrail, flipped, and burned. The driver died. The passenger survived. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>In three and a half years, <strong>11 people have died</strong> on these streets. <strong>44 more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers keep rising.</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are the first to bleed. In the last year, two people over 75 died. Children were hurt. The old, the young, the ones who walk—these are the bodies left behind. Cars and SUVs killed four. Trucks killed two. Bikes and mopeds left their mark, but the weight of steel does most of the damage.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>City Hall talks of Vision Zero. They say, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> But the dead keep coming. The city has the power now to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. Speed cameras work, but Albany lets their future hang by a thread. The law could expire. The cameras could go dark. The city builds new bike lanes and claims progress, but the blood on the crosswalks says otherwise.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its power. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to repair any curb deemed a safety hazard during street resurfacing. The matter summary reads: 'requiring that the department of transportation repair broken curbs as part of resurfacing projects.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Schulman, Brewer, Dinowitz, Krishnan, Narcisse, Menin, Yeger, Avilés, Nurse, Gutiérrez, Riley, Brannan, Sanchez, and Louis.

Christopher Marte, another council member, proposed two related bills: one limits delivery backpack weights, the other bans retaliation against workers who refuse unsafe deliveries or miss tight deadlines. Marte’s bill also requires companies promising 15-minute delivery to state that speed is not guaranteed, citing 'the safety of the public and delivery workers.' Menin said, 'These stores are operating in the city in a completely unregulated fashion.'

The proposal urges the Department of Transportation to close Broadway to most vehicles between 14th and 34th Streets next year, with future expansion to 42nd Street. The matter follows a severe June 20 crash where a taxi hit a cyclist. The politicians’ letter states: 'A safer, more pedestrian-friendly corridor must be achieved quickly.' Powers, along with Mark Levine, Carlina Rivera, and Erik Bottcher, argue the city’s current plan—limited to small plazas and traffic restrictions—is not enough. They demand bold action to protect pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s response: their plans already include many changes, but the council members say it falls short.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
