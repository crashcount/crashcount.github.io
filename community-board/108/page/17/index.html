A yellow cab made a U-turn and struck her. Moments later, a second car hit her. She died at the hospital. Both drivers stayed. No charges. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said.</a></p><p>A Tesla sped down the FDR, hit the guardrail, flipped, and burned. The driver died. The passenger survived. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>In three and a half years, <strong>11 people have died</strong> on these streets. <strong>44 more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers keep rising.</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are the first to bleed. In the last year, two people over 75 died. Children were hurt. The old, the young, the ones who walk—these are the bodies left behind. Cars and SUVs killed four. Trucks killed two. Bikes and mopeds left their mark, but the weight of steel does most of the damage.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>City Hall talks of Vision Zero. They say, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> But the dead keep coming. The city has the power now to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. Speed cameras work, but Albany lets their future hang by a thread. The law could expire. The cameras could go dark. The city builds new bike lanes and claims progress, but the blood on the crosswalks says otherwise.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its power. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors for the driver of the SUV. The SUV struck the rear of a sedan that was stopped in traffic, causing damage to the sedan's center back end and the SUV's right rear bumper. Two female drivers, aged 46 and 60, were injured with neck injuries and complaints of whiplash. Both were restrained with lap belts and were not ejected. The report highlights driver errors—specifically inattention and tailgating—as the cause, with no contributing factors attributed to the victims. This crash underscores the systemic danger posed by distracted driving and insufficient following distance in congested urban traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

City Hall offered no answers. Delivery workers wait. Council Member Powers grows impatient. Advocates warn registration could hurt cycling. The city stalls. Streets stay dangerous for riders and walkers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 2, 2024, Mayor Adams faced questions about Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar's bill to require e-bike registration and the city’s delay in launching a mandated battery swap program. The mayor called both topics 'off topic' at a press conference. City Hall later said it is reviewing the Rajkumar bill and that the Department of Transportation would oversee the battery swap program, but provided no timeline. The bill, based on disputed injury statistics, has drawn criticism from street safety advocates who argue registration would suppress cycling and sustainable transit. Local Law 131, sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers, requires the battery swap program, but the city has not acted. Powers voiced frustration, noting the Council plans to allocate $3 million for the program. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as city action stalls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors.
