Three people killed and 428 injured in the last year alone. Eight suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 90-year-old woman crossing York Avenue, struck by a taxi making a U-turn, then hit again by an SUV. She died at the hospital. Both drivers stayed. No charges filed. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said. Moments later, a 35-year-old woman driving a 2023 Chevrolet Trailblazer also struck her, police said.</a></p><p>A Tesla on the FDR Drive, speed unchecked, flips and burns. The driver is thrown from the car and dies. Her passenger survives. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>SUVs, sedans, taxis, trucks. They are the weapons. The victims are the old, the young, the ones who walk.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They say they are making streets safer. They say the right words. But on the ground, the pace is slow. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it.</p><p>Speed cameras work. They cut speeding by more than half. But the law that keeps them on is always at risk. Each year, Albany threatens to let them go dark. Each year, advocates fight to keep them alive.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The carnage is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, more families lose someone. The city can lower the speed limit now. They can harden crosswalks. They can build more protected lanes. They can act, or they can wait for the next siren.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the power they have. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand action.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
