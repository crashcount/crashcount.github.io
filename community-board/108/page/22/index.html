Twelve left with life-changing injuries. In the last twelve months, Manhattan CB8 saw 1,127 crashes—more than three a day. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just last week, eight people were hurt when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue. The cause is still unknown. No charges have been filed. The news reported, &ldquo;Eight people were hurt in the crash. All of the injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening.&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>ABC7</a></p><p>Days before, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled, drove onto the sidewalk, and later confessed. He told police he fled because he did not have a license. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a> The cyclist was left in critical condition.</p><p>The victims are old and young. In the last year, two people over 75 were killed. Eighteen children were injured. The numbers do not stop. They only climb.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>SUVs and cars do the most harm. They caused four deaths and nearly 300 injuries to people walking or biking. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds left more than a dozen hurt. Bikes injured 42, but killed no one. The street is not equal. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. State Senator Liz Krueger voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a> Assembly Member Rebecca Seawright co-sponsored a similar bill in the Assembly. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">Open States</a> But the carnage continues. Enforcement is weak. Cameras catch speeders, but the city has not lowered the default speed limit. Promises are made. The dead stay dead.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, and those who look away. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The board called on the Department of Motor Vehicles to impose civil penalties on unregistered dealers and urged city and state officials to enforce laws against selling non-street-legal mopeds. The resolution also asks the city to consider a buy-back program for gas-powered mopeds. The matter, titled 'Upper West Side Panel Backs Resolution to Rein in Dangerous Mopeds,' supports Albany legislation requiring sellers to register mopeds with the DMV before sale. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores sponsor the bill. Bores said, 'We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets.' The board’s move aims to close loopholes, protect vulnerable road users, and address the chaos caused by unregistered mopeds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, cleared the Council with a 32-15 vote. It reduces the waiting period after community board notification from 90 days plus 45 after a hearing, to just 14 days. The matter summary reads: 'The City Council repealed a decade-old law that imposed lengthy delays on the city before it could break ground on new bike lanes.' Restler said, 'No other transportation project in New York City...requires this type of extended dead period.' Council Member Keith Powers backed the bill, citing rising cyclist deaths. The Department of Transportation called bike lanes 'life-saving infrastructure.' The amended bill now covers all bike lanes, regardless of length.

The Council passed laws banning uncertified lithium-ion batteries and launched a trade-in program for unsafe batteries. The matter, titled 'NYC e-bike owners wonder where to store them as landlords fear battery fires,' highlights the tension: 'We're going to get into the business of getting the dangerous equipment off the street and set up a fund to do that,' Powers said. Advocacy groups, including Danny Harris, called for expanded safe bike parking and charging, stressing that e-bikes are a lifeline for many New Yorkers. The crackdown has led to stricter landlord policies, increased enforcement, and declining bike shop sales. The Council aims to improve safety without cutting off access for vulnerable road users who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
