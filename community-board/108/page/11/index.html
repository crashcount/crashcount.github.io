Twelve left with life-changing injuries. In the last twelve months, Manhattan CB8 saw 1,127 crashes—more than three a day. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just last week, eight people were hurt when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue. The cause is still unknown. No charges have been filed. The news reported, &ldquo;Eight people were hurt in the crash. All of the injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening.&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>ABC7</a></p><p>Days before, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled, drove onto the sidewalk, and later confessed. He told police he fled because he did not have a license. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a> The cyclist was left in critical condition.</p><p>The victims are old and young. In the last year, two people over 75 were killed. Eighteen children were injured. The numbers do not stop. They only climb.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>SUVs and cars do the most harm. They caused four deaths and nearly 300 injuries to people walking or biking. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds left more than a dozen hurt. Bikes injured 42, but killed no one. The street is not equal. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. State Senator Liz Krueger voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a> Assembly Member Rebecca Seawright co-sponsored a similar bill in the Assembly. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">Open States</a> But the carnage continues. Enforcement is weak. Cameras catch speeders, but the city has not lowered the default speed limit. Promises are made. The dead stay dead.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, and those who look away. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Four hundred delivery workers can swap dangerous, uncertified bikes for safe, legal models. The program targets deadly battery fires. But 400 is a drop in the bucket. Tens of thousands remain at risk. The danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On January 28, 2025, the Department of Transportation launched New York City's e-bike and moped trade-in program, born from a 2023 law introduced by Council Member Keith Powers. The program, praised by Council Member Oswald Feliz, allows 400 delivery workers to exchange uncertified, fire-prone bikes for certified, street-legal models. The law followed a spike in lithium-ion battery fires—277 in 2024, killing six. The $2 million program offers bikes and spare batteries, but only scratches the surface for the city’s estimated 80,000 delivery workers. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called the effort a step toward safer, cleaner mobility. Applications close February 17. The program’s reach is small, leaving most workers exposed to the same deadly risks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
