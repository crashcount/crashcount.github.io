A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>In three and a half years, <strong>11 people have died</strong> on these streets. <strong>44 more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers keep rising.</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are the first to bleed. In the last year, two people over 75 died. Children were hurt. The old, the young, the ones who walk—these are the bodies left behind. Cars and SUVs killed four. Trucks killed two. Bikes and mopeds left their mark, but the weight of steel does most of the damage.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>City Hall talks of Vision Zero. They say, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> But the dead keep coming. The city has the power now to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. Speed cameras work, but Albany lets their future hang by a thread. The law could expire. The cameras could go dark. The city builds new bike lanes and claims progress, but the blood on the crosswalks says otherwise.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its power. Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
