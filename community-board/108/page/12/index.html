Since 2022, the board area logged <strong>12 deaths</strong> and more than a thousand injuries. In the last 12 months alone: <strong>4 dead, 554 injured</strong>. The line keeps rising.</p><h3 id=york-and-68th-a-walk-signal-then-a-body>York and 68th: a walk signal, then a body</h3><p>A 71‑year‑old woman entered the crosswalk at York and East 68th with the signal. An SUV driver turned right and hit her. She died. The crash report lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows the case as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4664179</a> and places it at the intersection.</p><p>At York and East 87th, a 30‑year‑old woman died at the intersection in 2024. Multiple cars were moving through. The record lists her as a pedestrian with “Apparent Death.” See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4714580</a>.</p><p>A 90‑year‑old woman was struck near York and East 72nd in February. The report notes she was crossing with no signal or crosswalk and lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” She died. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4790720</a>.</p><h3 id=fdr-drive-speed-and-steel>FDR Drive: speed and steel</h3><p>On the FDR, a driver died in a demolished 2020 sedan after an overnight crash. The report says “Unsafe Speed.” The victim is listed as ejected with “Apparent Death.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4790343</a>.</p><p>The board’s worst locations tell the same story. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>FDR Drive</a> leads with 3 deaths and 336 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Second Avenue</a> follows with 2 deaths and 67 injuries.

Since 2022 here: pedestrians, <strong>6 dead and 388 injured</strong>; cyclists, <strong>2 dead and 332 injured</strong>. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage to people on foot. In the pedestrian roll‑up, SUVs lead, tied to <strong>4 deaths</strong> and over a hundred injuries; sedans follow. Trucks and buses are fewer but still deadly.

The vague label does not soften the outcome.

Advocates warned most of the corridor “will remain deadly.” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>. NY1 reported the city would add barriers and lower speeds at that site after the crash. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</p><p>Uptown, the state Senate moved a bill to force chronic speeders to slow down. Committee votes advanced a measure requiring intelligent speed assistance after repeated violations. Sen. Liz Krueger voted yes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, congestion pricing — a tool that cuts car trips and pays for transit — sits paused. The hardware stands idle. “They should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown,” Council Member Keith Powers said in coverage of the pause. <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>NY Post</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-this-ground-not-the-press-release>Fix this ground, not the press release</h3><p>Start where people die. Daylight the corners on York and Second. Harden the turns. Give leading pedestrian intervals and keep them. Build protected space, continuous, on the east side avenues. On the FDR frontage, narrow entries and slow the ramps. Target repeat hot spots with 24/7 camera enforcement and signal timing that favors walkers.</p><p>Then go citywide. <strong>Lower the default speed limit to 20 mph</strong> under Sammy’s Law. <strong>Force repeat speeders to use speed limiters</strong>. Albany gave the city tools. The Senate has moved the limiter bill. These are not theories. They are choices.</p><p>Do not wait for another body. Act: <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

The bill, debated on December 12, 2024, sits before the City Council. It would require all e-mobility devices not covered by the state DMV to register with the city’s Department of Transportation. The bill’s summary states it aims to increase accountability for e-bike riders after fatal crashes. Holden, the sponsor, cited dangers from unregulated e-vehicles and hit-and-runs. Advocacy groups, including Los Deliveristas Unidos and Open Plans, argue the bill would unfairly criminalize immigrants and delivery workers, and increase police stops for people of color. The NYC Hospitality Alliance warns of new financial and administrative burdens for small businesses. Both sides agree cars cause far more deaths, but the bill’s critics say better street design, not registration, would protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan aims to shrink shed sprawl, speed up repairs, and reclaim public space. Residents lose sunlight and safety to these hulking structures. The council moves to change that.</p><p class=mb3>Bill details: City Council legislative proposal on sidewalk shed reform, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers (District 4) and others. The bill is under council review as of December 10, 2024. The measure seeks to overhaul regulations that force NYCHA to keep up over 400 sidewalk sheds—spanning 25 miles—often long after repairs finish. The matter summary states, 'reforming parts of the city’s broader shedding regulations that are a poor fit for NYCHA and a nuisance citywide.' Powers and co-sponsor Erik Bottcher aim to reduce shed length, extend inspection cycles, and allow more art and color on scaffolds. Jamie Rubin, NYCHA board head, supports the bill, noting that current rules rob residents of sunlight, safety, and outdoor space. The bill promises to remove unnecessary sheds, reclaim millions in wasted funds, and improve daily life for public housing residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cars return. Pedestrians lose ground. Advocates and lawmakers protest. Sales soared last year. Now, the city cites security. Sidewalks may widen, but bike lanes vanish. Buses slow. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>""This is something we should be doing every year across the month of the December, it’s such an easy win for the area in Midtown,"" -- Keith Powers</p><p class=mb3>On December 4, 2024, the Adams administration cut the Fifth Avenue holiday Open Street program in Midtown from three Sundays to just one, shrinking the car-free zone to December 8 between 48th and 55th streets. The Fifth Avenue Association blamed security around Trump Tower. The matter summary reads: 'City scales back hugely popular Fifth Ave. Holiday Open Street despite sales boosts.' Council Member Keith Powers called the move 'surprising' and urged a full return next year. Advocates called it 'frustrating and disappointing.' Mayor Adams had previously praised the program, which boosted sales by $3 million in 2023. The Department of Transportation now touts sidewalk expansion, but the new redesign drops a planned bike lane and may slow buses. Pedestrians and cyclists lose space. The city’s retreat keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
