A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The proposal follows community workshops where residents demanded safer, people-first streets and dedicated loading zones. DOT will close the northern-most block of Underhill to cars, add two-way bike lanes, and install pinch-points to slow drivers. On Vanderbilt, sharrows become painted bike lanes, and new pedestrian islands and turn lanes will protect cyclists and walkers. DOT hopes to begin construction in the fall and is reviewing the neighborhood for further changes.

DOT Project Manager Jenny Leung said the city is updating conditions and planning stakeholder engagement.

FDNA Board Member Catherine Hughes pressed for urgency, saying, 'It's time for a pilot project now.' Business leader Jessica Lappin voiced logistical concerns.

DOT Director of Bus Priority Kyle Gebhart said, “Everything is on the table.” The agency’s data shows slow buses and high rates of pedestrian and cyclist injuries. The plan divides the corridor into three segments for tailored solutions, including curbside and center-running bus lanes, transit signal priority, and busways. Some business groups voiced anger over possible parking loss, but transit advocates countered that most shoppers do not drive. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein said, “Busways are great for business, bringing more customers from more neighborhoods more efficiently and affordably.” The project’s outcome will shape safety for thousands who walk, bike, and ride.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation will present its draft plan to Brooklyn Community Board 1’s Transportation Committee on June 30. The petition, described as a call for 'wider sidewalks and a wider median, a protected bike lane, and eliminating one lane of traffic in each direction,' follows the hit-and-run death of teacher Matthew Jensen. Gallagher stated, 'Our community is speaking loud and clear: no more deaths on McGuinness.' The campaign has support from Councilmember Lincoln Restler and Borough President Antonio Reynoso. The street, a busy four-lane truck route, has seen dozens of crashes and injuries in recent years.

The Department of Sanitation will install several dozen rat-proof trash bins for building managers and superintendents to store garbage and recycling, moving bags off sidewalks and into curbside street lanes. The matter summary reads: 'Testing a rat-proof trash container... instead of on the sidewalk.' Council Member Erik Bottcher said he is 'thrilled that our district was the first to be chosen for this exciting advance,' calling it 'another important step.' The pilot takes parking space for bins, sparking complaints from drivers but clearing pedestrian paths. The city plans to expand the $1.3-million program to all five boroughs. Critics note the bins are small and collection methods unchanged, limiting scale.

They acknowledged recent progress but warned, 'the disturbing incidents we've seen in recent weeks and the last 48 hours remind us just how fragile those positive steps are and how much more work remains.'

Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children.

The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns.

The matter centers on congestion pricing, which Lieber and advocates call the largest, most environmentally beneficial funding source for the MTA.
