A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Danny Harris urged Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez to invest in safe streets and fulfill the NYC Streets Plan’s legal requirements.

The report, led by Clare Miflin of the Center for Zero Waste Design, states: 'The Vanderbilt Avenue open street in Brooklyn could become a blueprint for how the city can finally containerize its trash for collection.' The analysis found that containers could replace sidewalk trash piles, freeing up as much as 25 percent of pedestrian space. The Department of Transportation is redesigning the road, adding curb extensions and loading zones, while the Department of Sanitation considers new collection methods. The plan calls for curbside bins, reducing sidewalk obstacles for pedestrians and shifting space away from cars and trash. No council member sponsored this report, but city agencies and experts are involved. The report argues for urgent action to reclaim public space from garbage and vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates warn it steals curb space from bike lanes and plazas. Billions go to cars, not transit or safe walking. The plan leaves vulnerable road users in the dust.</p><p class=mb3>On March 24, 2023, the Biden administration announced a federal initiative to build a vast network of electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs, aiming for 500,000 plugs and offering a $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit. The policy, described as a 'multi-billion dollar network of electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs,' claims to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030. Transportation advocates Jon Orcutt, Chris Rall, and Jaqi Cohen voiced strong opposition, warning that the plan entrenches car dependency and endangers future use of curb space for bike lanes, pedestrian plazas, or outdoor dining. Critics argue the federal grant program ignores transit riders and fails to electrify municipal fleets. As one advocate put it, 'Billions of dollars are essentially being spent to further the public’s dependence on cars with little benefit to those who cannot rely on one.' The initiative, lacking support for transit or active transportation, leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, described as creating 'a seamless boarding experience for parents,' will allow strollers to remain open on buses, ending the need for parents to fold them before boarding. Assemblymember Grace Lee, representing District 65, voiced strong support, sharing her own struggles as a parent navigating transit with strollers. The expansion follows positive feedback and no reported safety incidents during the pilot’s first phase. The designated stroller spaces will not compromise wheelchair access, ensuring continued priority for riders with disabilities. The move marks a step toward safer, more accessible transit for families and vulnerable riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City pays more, gets less. Riders face fare hikes, no better service. State hoards surplus, starves transit. Lawmakers protest. Suburbs dodge taxes. The city shoulders the load. Riders pay the price. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Governor Hochul’s 2023 state budget proposal, analyzed March 3, 2023, keeps New York State’s long-running refusal to match MTA funding under law 18-b. The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt. The budget leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as transit stagnates and car dominance persists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bus riders stood in slush. Bike lanes vanished under piles. Sanitation crews cleared some paths, but Parks left cycling routes blocked. Brooklyn Bridge bike path shined. Most streets failed the vulnerable. The city’s patchwork snow plan left danger for all who walk or ride.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2023, Streetsblog NYC published a report on New York City’s first major snow of the year. The article, titled 'Eyes on the Street: The First (And Only?) Snow Report of the Year,' details how sidewalk snow clearance, left to property owners, forced bus riders into slush. Painted bike lanes became useless as drivers shoveled snow into them and plows avoided parked cars. The Department of Sanitation’s new narrow snowplows cleared some routes well, but the Parks Department left cycling paths impassable, showing 'no interest...to encourage cycling.' Only the Brooklyn Bridge bike path stood out, freshly swept and safe. No council bill or vote is attached, but the report exposes how city agencies’ uneven snow removal endangers pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
