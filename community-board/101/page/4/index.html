Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member.

The bill, sponsored by Charles Fall (District 61), was introduced on February 4, 2025. It is titled: 'Relates to photo speed violation monitoring systems in school speed zones in the city of New York.' The measure 'reduces the radial distance from school buildings for such school speed zones.' This means fewer streets near schools will be covered by speed cameras. Fall’s sponsorship signals support for shrinking the protected area. No votes have been recorded yet. The bill’s change strips away a layer of safety for children and other vulnerable road users who walk near schools. No safety analyst has weighed in, but the intent is clear: less camera coverage, more danger at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, and others. No votes have been recorded yet. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving by forcing speed limiters on offenders.
