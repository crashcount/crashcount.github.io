A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>.

The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings.

The program grows, block by block.</p><p class=mb3>On September 27, 2022, the Department of Sanitation announced the expansion of its 'Clean Curbs' pilot program to Staten Island, with a new installation at 704 Bay St. The initiative, previously launched in Times Square and Brooklyn, containerizes commercial trash to clear sidewalks of leaky bags. The Staten Island Chamber of Commerce received a $3,500 grant for the project, which uses bins from CITIBIN, a Brooklyn-based woman-owned business. DSNY spokesman Vincent Gragnani said, 'Use of bins in these two different locations...will improve quality of life in these locations, while helping us learn more about containerized trash in a variety of New York City settings.' The program also repurposes curbside space for public use—like loading zones and parklets—instead of private car storage, freeing up sidewalks for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Elizabeth Adams called for protected bike lanes, saying, 'For the future of our climate and the safety on our streets, protected bike lanes need to be a priority.'

The report states, 'sales of gas-guzzling pickups and SUVs are also surging. This other face of the market subverts electric cars’ carbon-cutting progress.' No council bill number or committee is attached, as this is a policy report, not legislation.

The author urges tightening greenhouse gas standards, especially for large gasoline-powered vehicles, and closing loopholes that let automakers evade meaningful carbon cuts.

The bill sits stalled in the Assembly committee since January. The measure, sponsored by Senator Julia Salazar, would require NYSERDA to cover half the cost of e-bike purchases, up to $1,100. Salazar said, 'When the federal government falls short, it really does fall on the state to step up and take responsibility.' Assembly sponsor Robert Carroll added, 'This is not a luxury item.' The bill’s summary states it aims to make e-bikes accessible and reduce car dependence. If enacted, New York would join a handful of states offering direct e-bike subsidies, targeting emissions and car use in daily trips.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states: 'Air quality and public health in the Bronx will receive a boost from congestion pricing, even under a toll scenario that diverts substantial truck traffic.' The analysis draws from the MTA's environmental assessment, especially Toll Scenario A, which projects less particulate matter (PM2.5) in Bronx air despite increased vehicle miles. The health benefits for Bronx residents match those in Queens, Brooklyn, and Hudson County. Environmental justice and transportation advocates call for rapid electrification of buses and trucks, capping highways, and rigorous air monitoring to prevent new pollution hot spots. The analysis values total health benefits at $20.8 million for 2023.

He calls for better data, more transparency, and front cameras on giant cars. But cameras alone won’t shrink vehicles or save enough lives. The real fix: fewer, smaller cars on the road.</p><p class=mb3>On August 17, 2022, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) pressed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to address frontover crashes—fatal incidents where large vehicles strike unseen children in front. The senator’s letter called for annual injury and fatality data, improved data collection, and efforts to prevent future deaths. He stated, 'Safety is not—and should never be—a premium feature only available to those who can afford it; it should be the default.' Blumenthal’s push follows a demonstration showing ten children hidden in a single SUV’s blind spot. The bill’s focus is on mandating front cameras, but experts and advocates warn this won’t fix the core problem: cars are too big, too tall, too deadly. As noted, 'The most effective way to reduce tragic frontover deaths is to have fewer cars in American driveways.' Cameras help, but shrinking vehicles and reducing car dependency would save more lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
