A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states: 'Air quality and public health in the Bronx will receive a boost from congestion pricing, even under a toll scenario that diverts substantial truck traffic.' The analysis draws from the MTA's environmental assessment, especially Toll Scenario A, which projects less particulate matter (PM2.5) in Bronx air despite increased vehicle miles. The health benefits for Bronx residents match those in Queens, Brooklyn, and Hudson County. Environmental justice and transportation advocates call for rapid electrification of buses and trucks, capping highways, and rigorous air monitoring to prevent new pollution hot spots. The analysis values total health benefits at $20.8 million for 2023.

He calls for better data, more transparency, and front cameras on giant cars. But cameras alone won’t shrink vehicles or save enough lives. The real fix: fewer, smaller cars on the road.</p><p class=mb3>On August 17, 2022, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) pressed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to address frontover crashes—fatal incidents where large vehicles strike unseen children in front. The senator’s letter called for annual injury and fatality data, improved data collection, and efforts to prevent future deaths. He stated, 'Safety is not—and should never be—a premium feature only available to those who can afford it; it should be the default.' Blumenthal’s push follows a demonstration showing ten children hidden in a single SUV’s blind spot. The bill’s focus is on mandating front cameras, but experts and advocates warn this won’t fix the core problem: cars are too big, too tall, too deadly. As noted, 'The most effective way to reduce tragic frontover deaths is to have fewer cars in American driveways.' Cameras help, but shrinking vehicles and reducing car dependency would save more lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

An opinion from a Transportation Alternatives staffer urged the Council to 'transform impervious driving lanes into green climate solutions.' The piece calls for bioswales and greenspace in place of parking, citing the deadly floods after Hurricane Ida. It highlights that 72 percent of city land is impervious, worsening flash floods. The author presses city leaders, including Mayor Eric Adams, to repurpose street space for climate resilience, referencing the NYC 25x25 challenge. The message is clear: 'Our streets can become the solution to climate change and flooding.'

The truck driver’s lack of full licensing and inexperience played a key role in the crash. The sedan driver was not at fault. No ejections occurred, and the injury severity was moderate.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

It allocates $369 billion to decarbonize sectors like power plants and HVAC, aiming for a 40% emissions cut by 2030. The bill continues the $7,500 federal EV tax credit and adds a $4,000 credit for used EVs, but omits dedicated funding for electric transit, freight, or e-bikes. Advocates like Yonah Freemark, David Zipper, and Noa Banayan criticize the focus on large electric SUVs and trucks, calling them dangerous for people outside cars. Zipper says, “We’re actually inducing people to buy heavier, more dangerous electric automobiles.” The bill introduces a $3.4 billion Neighborhood Equity and Access Grant, but skips high-speed rail and transit. Advocates urge more action, warning that the bill leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency projects only 74% of pre-pandemic riders will return by 2024, leaving a $4 billion revenue gap through 2026. The matter summary warns, 'Without a new funding stream, the MTA faces a fiscal cliff after 2023.' MTA Chief Financial Officer Kevin Willens urged state legislators to act, saying, 'If we start working together and start solving the deficit by 2023, we can lower the fiscal cliff by a billion dollars a year.' Advocates like Rachael Fauss criticized the state's gas-tax holiday, arguing it incentivized driving over transit funding. State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli warned of looming service changes. The bill is not tied to a specific council number or committee, but the call for recurring, dedicated state revenue is clear. Without intervention, vulnerable transit riders face reduced service and higher fares, deepening the city's transportation divide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DiNapoli opposes service cuts and supports realigning schedules to match shifting demand, especially off-peak and weekends. MTA Chief External Relations John McCarthy echoed the need for a post-COVID plan. The report stresses that mass transit is essential for New Yorkers.

Lives depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>On July 20, 2022, Streetsblog NYC published a report titled 'Four Factors Driving the Bus Operator Shortage (And What to Do About Them).' The analysis highlights that over 90% of transit agencies struggle to hire bus drivers, forcing 71% to cut or delay service. The report cites low pay, workplace assaults, harsh schedules, and lack of basic facilities as root causes. It urges agencies to raise pay, cut hiring barriers, protect drivers, and provide humane schedules and facilities. The article states, 'Bus driver shortages are undermining transit agencies' efforts to recover from the pandemic and become the front-line mobility option that American cities need.' The report does not name specific council members or legislative actions, but it calls for systemic change to protect workers and restore reliable service for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay cluttered.</p><p class=mb3>The Clean Curbs pilot, launched by the Sanitation Department and Times Square Alliance, rolled out steel-and-bamboo trash enclosures at Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street in April 2022. By July 20, bins showed leaks, unlocked doors, and garbage overflow. The pilot, costing $1.3 million, aims to 'test methods for getting garbage bags off the streets.' Sanitation spokesman Vincent Gragnani promised daily cleaning and improved maintenance, saying, 'If this is a recurring issue, it will be taken into account as we expand the program.' CITIBIN owner Liz Picarazzi admitted the bins are over-capacity and need more frequent cleaning. Critics call the pilot too small for New York’s scale. Streets remain hazardous for walkers, who still dodge trash and puddles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The numbers do not lie.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published July 20, 2022, by Charles Komanoff in Streetsblog NYC, examines the effect of high gas prices on driving in New York State. Komanoff, a longtime advocate for congestion pricing and carbon taxes, analyzes state motor fuel tax receipts from 2019 to 2022. He finds a 16 percent drop in fuel sales, with April 2022 showing a stark 40 percent decline compared to April 2019. The piece, titled 'High Gas Prices Are Reducing Driving!', challenges claims that Americans are immune to price signals. Komanoff writes, 'Pricing has power. Changes in the prices of goods and services affect demand for those items.' No council bill or vote is involved. The analysis underscores that fewer cars mean safer streets for vulnerable road users, though no formal safety assessment is provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city will add gravel, markings, and planters. The move follows years of temporary closures. Locals and businesses welcome the change. Streets once deadly for walkers now belong to them.</p><p class=mb3>On July 19, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation announced the full pedestrianization of Doyers Street in Chinatown, formalizing its status as a car-free plaza. The project builds on the success of Covid-era open streets and seasonal closures. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, "DOT is proud to build on the success of our Open Streets with proposals to formalize spaces like the Doyers Open Street as a permanent pedestrian plaza." Wellington Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership, praised the move, calling it "healthier and safer for both shopkeepers and customers." The plan includes new plaza features and changes to nearby parking for commercial loading. The effort is part of a broader city push, with BIDs leading similar projects across New York. The conversion gives crowded Chinatown a rare, needed refuge for pedestrians and local businesses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
