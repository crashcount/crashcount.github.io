A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill would cut the required minimum personal injury protection insurance for yellow cabs, liveries, and app-based drivers from $200,000 to $50,000. At a recent hearing, Lauren Pine, a nurse and crash survivor, testified: 'The minimum $50,000 no fault insurance was exhausted within the first week or so of my hospitalization.' Pine urged the Council to oppose the bill, warning that victims of traffic violence would be left financially devastated. Transportation Alternatives’ Ben Furnas also opposed the bill, stating, 'This legislation will ultimately make it more expensive and difficult to access care, treatment, and support after a traffic crash.' The bill is generating support among some council members, but advocates and survivors demand the Council maintain current coverage to protect crash victims.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, introduced late Friday, would let Governor Hochul delay a congressional special election until November 4, leaving nearly 800,000 upstate residents without representation. The editorial quotes, 'wiping out congressional representation for so many people for so long is unfair and undemocratic and unconstitutional.' Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key player. Hochul requested the bill be put on hold, pausing the plan. The editorial supports congestion pricing, noting it has 'successfully reduced Midtown and Downtown traffic,' but condemns using democracy as a bargaining chip.

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, released February 7, 2025, by the Independent Budget Office, exposes the city’s failure to meet the Streets Master Plan law (passed in 2019) mandating 150 miles of new bus lanes. The IBO states: 'It will be virtually impossible for the city to meet the City Council's required 150 miles of new bus lanes at the pace Mayor Adams is going.' Mayor Adams, who took office in 2022, has slowed or killed key bus projects, including the Fordham Road busway. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno claims the agency is building protected lanes and using cameras for enforcement, but admits resources are tight. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has called for compliance but not funded it. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein blames hiring freezes and political interference for 'broken promises and neglected legislation.' The report shows that while DOT’s budget grew, staffing for bus lane expansion fell. Bus speeds remain stuck at 8.1 mph. The city’s inaction leaves millions of bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—stranded and exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate included calls for audits and cost reductions from Rep. Mike Lawler, while MTA Chair Janno Lieber promised to prioritize repairs over expansion. The committee has not yet voted. Riders voiced anger over high fares and little visible improvement.

The Council, after pressure from housing opponents, reinstated parking requirements in many transit-served neighborhoods, despite the City Planning Commission's push to eliminate them citywide. The matter, as described, states: 'Anyone not supporting the elimination of parking mandates is only perpetuating our city's housing crisis.' Planning expert Eric Kober, the author, argues the Council's move blocks housing growth and contradicts city policies to reduce car use. Council members' actions—passing a diluted version of COYHO—leave vulnerable road users exposed. The compromise preserves car dominance, keeps streets dangerous, and stalls progress for safer, people-first neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case is not a council bill, but a flashpoint in the debate over child independence and pedestrian safety. Prosecutor Emma Harper said the arrest was due to the boy walking on 'a busy highway with no sidewalk.' The matter highlights how parents, not road designers or drivers, face consequences when children navigate unsafe streets. Advocates, including Lenore Skenazy and attorney David DeLugas, condemned the criminalization of parents and called for accountability in road design. Streets like Mineral Bluff Highway, with high speeds and no sidewalks, endanger all pedestrians. The story underscores a systemic failure: dangerous roads persist, while parents and children bear the risk and blame.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler’s action highlights the burden on low-income riders and the need for regulation. The bill’s status is pending in committee. Mayor Adams voiced support for subsidies but offered no plan.

No protected bike lanes. The driver sped off. The street stayed the same. Neighbors rallied. The council member listened. The injury was harsh. The system failed. Brooklyn’s gap in bike safety remains wide.</p><p class=mb3>On January 9, 2025, Streetsblog NYC published an essay detailing a crash on Henry Street in Brooklyn. The piece, titled 'A Brush With Danger Made Me Exhibit A in My Fight for Better Bike Lanes in Brooklyn,' describes the lack of protected bike lanes in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. The author recounts merging into traffic, being closely followed by a driver, and crashing on a wet, greasy iron grid. The car sped away. Passersby helped. The cyclist suffered a broken collarbone. The essay notes, 'Our area of Brooklyn is a major hole in the borough's protected bike lane network.' Council Member Shahana Hanif attended a community meeting on the issue. The call is clear: Brooklyn’s streets favor cars, not people. The absence of protected lanes leaves cyclists exposed and injured. The system’s neglect is the danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It targets drivers who block bike lanes. The bill adds a mandatory surcharge. Money goes to the court. Cyclists get no relief until cars clear the lane.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly bill A 1236 was introduced on January 9, 2025. It sits at the sponsorship stage. The bill, titled 'Relates to violations and a mandatory surcharge for parking in a bicycle lane,' would require drivers who block bike lanes to pay a mandatory surcharge to the court that finds them liable. Jo Anne Simon (District 52) leads as primary sponsor, joined by Deborah Glick (District 66) and Tony Simone (District 75) as co-sponsors. The bill aims to penalize drivers who endanger cyclists by blocking bike lanes, but its impact depends on enforcement and driver behavior.
