A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure, shaped by a Council law passed last year, forced all businesses to clear curbside setups by November 29. The Department of Transportation banned enclosed structures, allowing only temporary, open designs. As the city’s Dining Out NYC program shifts to seasonal operation, many owners, like John Kastanis of Casita and Jerry Hsu of Alimama Tea, chose to dismantle their sheds early, citing high fees and storage hurdles. Fred Kent, co-founder of the Placemaking Fund, lamented, “We’ve lost a whole era that could have been evolved into something far more significant for neighborhood main streets to thrive.” The curb returns to cars, erasing space once claimed by pedestrians and diners.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency now plans to study a tunnel under All Faiths Cemetery at Metropolitan Avenue. MTA President of Construction and Development Jamie Torres-Springer said, "We're looking at a tunnel at Metropolitan Avenue, which will allow us to avoid street running to make the [Interborough Express] faster and more reliable." Transit advocates, including Blair Lorenzo of the Effective Transit Alliance, praised the decision, calling it a win for speed and reliability. The MTA will assess expanding the existing freight tunnel or building a new one. The engineering and environmental review will take about two years. Funding for the IBX remains uncertain, as MTA CEO Janno Lieber warned that expansion projects could be at risk if the 2025-2029 capital plan falls short. The move removes a threat to vulnerable road users by keeping trains off city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable users wait.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Transportation’s Smart Curbs pilot, updated October 29, 2024, aims to convert free parking to paid meters and add delivery microhubs on the Upper West Side. The plan, first proposed in June, promised about 200 new metered spots and 27 loading zones, but only 175 free spaces—one-tenth of the area’s 1,700—will be removed. Microhubs, meant to reduce double-parking and delivery chaos, are delayed until next year. DOT spokespersons Vin Barone and Mona Bruno confirmed most changes are just reassignments, not true removals of free parking. Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS called the slow pace disappointing: “We’ve been super eager to see these changes, see what their impact is and start measuring and observing, so it’s a little disappointing.” Parking expert Donald Shoup urged the city to reinvest meter revenue locally, but DOT declined.

The project, covered in committee and public statements, is described as 'transformative for so many New Yorkers.' Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who represents the area, had threatened to oppose the IBX if it included street-running. After the MTA’s shift to tunneling, Holden stated, 'Addressing the biggest issue by forgoing light rail on 69th Street is crucial to earning our support.' The plan eliminates a dangerous section where trams would have mixed with cars, reducing exposure for pedestrians and cyclists. The MTA has issued a request for proposals to design the line and guide it through federal review. The $5.5 billion project’s funding remains uncertain, but the tunnel plan removes a major safety concern for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, not tied to a council bill but crucial for transit policy, states: 'The MTA can't take on any more debt to fill the hole...without dramatically jacking up fares or cutting service.' DiNapoli’s analysis shows that borrowing $15 billion now, plus $13 billion more for the next plan, would force a 16 percent fare hike by 2037. He notes the MTA’s finances are already strained by weak real estate taxes and slow ridership recovery. DiNapoli opposes fare hikes and service cuts, backing congestion pricing and state support instead. He stresses that without new, reliable revenue, vulnerable riders will pay the price. The warning is clear: more debt means danger for those who depend on transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The toll on life and air remains high.</p><p class=mb3>On October 15, 2024, researchers from Duke, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and the University of Chicago published a working paper through the National Bureau of Economic Research. The report, titled 'The Effects of 'Buy American': Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act,' analyzes the full societal costs of electric vehicles (EVs) versus gasoline vehicles (GVs). The study finds, 'U.S. electric vehicles are only slightly less harmful to the environment and society than conventional gasoline cars.' The analysis aggregates climate damage, crash deaths, and pollution. It reveals that EVs’ heavier weight leads to more fatal crashes, and their battery production is energy-intensive. Charging EVs on carbon-heavy grids causes six times more harmful pollution than gas tailpipes. The authors conclude that, factoring in all harms, EVs are only 10 percent less damaging than GVs. The report urges policymakers to reconsider subsidies and warns that the real-world toll of cars—electric or not—remains immense.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It allows more crosswalks, green bike lanes, and transit lanes. But it still puts cars first. Pedestrians and cyclists remain at risk. The rules demand human perfection, not safer streets. The danger continues.</p><p class=mb3>On December 2023, the Federal Highway Administration released the 11th Edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), the first update since 2009. This federal document, over 1,000 pages, sets the standards for road markings, signals, and signs nationwide. The update, described as 'important steps toward a safer, more people-focused transportation system,' modernizes speed zone setting and allows more crosswalks, green bike lanes, and red transit lanes. But it still falls short. The MUTCD expects pedestrians and cyclists to act 'alertly and attentively,' ignoring human error and the diversity of street users. It keeps high barriers for pedestrian signals and prioritizes car movement over safety. The new section on autonomous vehicles raises concerns about streets being built for machines, not people. No council members are named; this is a federal action. Advocates and cities submitted over 25,000 comments demanding stronger reforms. The next update is due by December 2027.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, details Samuelsen’s resignation from the Traffic Mobility Review Board on November 30, 2023, the day tolling recommendations were released. He argued, 'Congestion pricing alone will not reduce traffic to its fullest potential. Central business district tolling should absolutely be coupled with massive increases and improvements in public transit service.' Samuelsen criticized the MTA for not expanding service and called the toll 'classist.' His stance shifted from earlier support in 2019 to strong opposition, citing unmet promises and risks to transit funding. No council bill or committee action is noted. The union’s move leaves vulnerable road users facing the same old dangers: crowded streets, slow buses, and stalled safety reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Stores fill up. Foot traffic surges. Shopkeepers call it a game-changer. Customers linger, spend, and smile. Lawsuits and car complaints fade against the buzz of busy sidewalks. Open Streets means safety, commerce, and life.</p><p class=mb3>The Columbus Avenue Open Streets program closes the avenue to cars between 68th and 77th streets every Sunday through October 27, 2024. The initiative, described as 'an absolute game-changer' by Martin Johnson of 67 Gourmet, boosts business and draws crowds on foot. Irene Kalogrias of Celso de Lemos says, 'Open street days are the busiest days for our store.' Vinni Schroeder of J.Jill urges expansion. Despite a lawsuit from some residents, business owners support the program. The matter, titled 'Tables of Success: Columbus Ave. Businesses Love the Open Street,' highlights how car-free streets bring safety and commerce. No formal council bill or vote is noted. The program stands as a testament to the power of reclaiming streets for people, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
