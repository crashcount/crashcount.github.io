A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The action responds to Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause on congestion pricing, which threatens $2 billion in elevator projects at 23 stations. Organizers cite the MTA’s legal mandate to make 95 percent of the subway accessible by 2055 and warn of a 30 percent cut to ADA spending without congestion pricing funds. Jeff Peters of the Center for Independence of the Disabled NY said, 'Congestion pricing would be used for just this situation.' Danna Dennis of Riders Alliance and Jessica Murray of Elevator Action Group joined calls for action.

The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Paint and ticket blitzes failed. Bus speeds barely moved. Riders remain stuck in traffic. Cars clog lanes. Promised fixes scrapped. Advocates demand real action. The city stalls. Riders suffer.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2024, MTA officials sent a scathing letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, criticizing the city’s decision to abandon plans to upgrade Fordham Road’s curbside bus lanes to offset bus lanes. The letter, signed by outgoing NYCT President Richard Davey and interim successor Demetrius Crichlow, called the city’s paint-and-enforcement approach a 'total bust.' The MTA cited new data showing bus speeds increased just 2–4 percent since October 2022—far below the 15 percent target. The matter summary reads: 'The Fordham Road project enjoys widespread support from transit advocacy groups, and Fordham Road bus riders, who have been enduring slow service for decades.' Council involvement is not specified, but the MTA’s letter and Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein both demand stronger measures. The city’s inaction leaves Bronx bus riders stranded in slow traffic, with vulnerable road users paying the price for political compromise.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Weprin is mentioned.</p><p class=mb3>On August 11, 2024, Council Member David Weprin (District 24) was mentioned in a report examining alternatives to congestion pricing for MTA funding. The Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA (PCAC) found that 'various proposals to replace the mass transit money lost from pausing congestion pricing either don’t raise the same revenue or fail to achieve other benefits such as reduced traffic from the Manhattan toll.' The report, reviewed by Weprin, details that none of the eight alternatives—ranging from payroll taxes to casino revenue—would match congestion pricing’s $1 billion annual yield or its bondable value. Lisa Daglian, PCAC’s executive director, said these options either fall short on funding or burden working New Yorkers, while missing out on cleaner air and less traffic. The MTA has suspended billions in modernization work. The pause leaves vulnerable riders and city streets exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Speaking at a Colorado think tank, Hochul insisted, 'Pause is a pause until I say it's not a pause.' She urged the state legislature to address the $15-billion MTA funding shortfall, stating, 'The legislature has to come back and find a solution.' Congestion pricing, passed in 2019, was designed to fund transit and reduce deadly traffic. Critics, including transit advocates and policy experts, challenged Hochul’s authority and accuracy, noting her claims about economic hardship and London’s tolls were misleading. Hochul’s unilateral move leaves the law in limbo and threatens the future of safe, reliable transit for millions of New Yorkers. No council members were directly involved in this executive action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jeremy Cooney, new chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, issued a public demand for Governor Hochul to deliver a '100-day plan' to replace the $16.5 billion MTA funding shortfall caused by her cancellation of congestion pricing. In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of funding jeopardizes projects vital to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In an op-ed, Cooney wrote, “The time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed, what is most important is keeping our promise to the passengers and workers impacted across the state.” He urged Hochul to deliver a 100-day plan to replace the $16.5 billion MTA shortfall, either by alternative funding or reinstating tolls. Cooney warned that the pause means less expansion, less accessibility, dirtier buses, older trains, and outdated signals. The impact hits every region, but especially vulnerable transit riders who rely on safe, modern service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers offer no fix. Riders wait. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2024, advocates condemned Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing, a move that halted funding for 23 new subway elevators. The action, detailed in 'Disabled NYer’s are Victims of Gov. Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Pause,' leaves tens of thousands without access. Michelle Alcaraz and Ray Ray, both disabled New Yorkers, are forced to travel far from home or avoid transit altogether. The MTA’s $16 billion in scheduled repairs, including crucial accessibility upgrades, is now in limbo. Joe Rappaport of the Brooklyn Center for the Independence of the Disabled called on the governor and legislature to restore funding, warning that the lack of elevators treats disabled riders as 'second-class citizens.' The pause keeps stations dangerous for parents, caregivers, and the disabled. Lawmakers have yet to offer a solution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision involved a northbound bike traveling straight ahead, which struck the pedestrian at its center front end. The report identifies 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' by the bike operator and 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but the report emphasizes driver error and systemic danger rather than victim fault. The bike had no occupants other than the driver, and the impact caused damage to the bike's center front end.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
