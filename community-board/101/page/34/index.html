Councilmember Mary Cheh says it’s a step to offset harm from oversized vehicles.</p><p class=mb3>On May 27, 2022, the D.C. Council passed a bill to increase registration fees for large SUVs. The measure, led by Transportation Committee Chairwoman Mary Cheh, boosts fees to $500 for vehicles over 6,000 pounds, $250 for 5,000–6,000 pounds, and $175 for 3,500–5,000 pounds. The bill summary states, 'the larger a vehicle, the worse it is for the environment, the more damage it causes to our roads, and the more dangerous to others using the roadway.' Cheh, who wrote the proposal, said, 'drivers who pick these larger vehicles will now need to pay a bit more to compensate for that additional damage.' The council expects the new fees to raise $40 million over five years, funding street safety projects and road repairs. Cheh admits the policy is not a cure-all for traffic violence but calls it a step forward to recoup costs from oversized vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick, originally included tougher measures: escalating fines, registration suspensions, and insurance reporting for repeat speeders. These provisions were stripped during negotiations, leaving only the round-the-clock camera operation. Assembly Member Glick said, 'keeping the cameras on 24/7 was that hill.' Mayor Eric Adams called it 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives.' Advocacy groups and lawmakers voiced frustration at Albany’s reluctance to adopt stronger safety tools. The final law removes blackout periods for cameras, but leaves dangerous drivers with fewer consequences. The bill passed despite disappointment over its dilution, exposing the limits of legislative action for street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Repairs come, but safety lags.</p><p class=mb3>On May 23, 2022, the Parks Department presented plans to close the Shore Parkway Greenway between the Verrazzano Bridge and Bay Parkway for a year-long repair in 2024. The matter, discussed at Brooklyn Community Boards 10 and 11, aims to fix potholes, resurface the path, and repair the seawall. The presentation, however, lacked any guarantee of a safe alternate route for cyclists and pedestrians. Brooklyn Borough Commissioner Martin Maher admitted, 'I can't make any promises.' Council Member Carlina Rivera’s office noted her bill would require protections for cyclists around work zones, highlighting the gap in current planning. Executive Director Terri Carta of the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative said, 'NYC Parks and DOT need to provide a safe alternative for greenway users during construction.' Despite DOT’s willingness to help, no concrete detour exists.

Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024.

The city’s plan keeps eight car lanes, weak bike protection, and slow buses. Cyclists dodge cars. Bus riders wait. Drivers rule. Real safety demands fewer car lanes, center bus lanes, and true bike barriers.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published April 26, 2022, calls out the Department of Transportation’s plan for Queens Boulevard. The plan, part of the 'Great Streets' project, keeps eight car lanes and installs only lightly protected bike lanes with mountable curbs. Samuel Santaella, the author, writes: 'the department has discriminated against thousands of bikers and 13,630 pre-pandemic daily bus riders in order to privilege the needs of 40,000 daily motorists.' Santaella opposes the current DOT plan and urges a redesign: reduce car lanes to four, add center-running bus lanes, fully separated bikeways, and wider sidewalks. He warns that mountable curbs let drivers invade bike lanes, putting cyclists at risk. Bus riders see little benefit, still stuck behind double-parked cars. The piece demands the city stop favoring drivers and start protecting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler called it a dramatic step for street safety. The sum falls short of Council’s ask, but promises hardened lanes and real barriers for cyclists and bus riders.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2022, Mayor Eric Adams announced a $900 million budget proposal for street safety infrastructure. The plan, part of ongoing budget talks, aims to fund hundreds of miles of protected bike and bus lanes, plus concrete barriers. Council Member Lincoln Restler of District 33, a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, praised the move as 'a very clear commitment to addressing street safety across the five boroughs.' The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists. The Council had requested $3.1 billion, but Restler called the $900 million a dramatic investment. The budget must be finalized by June 30.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Volunteers still shoulder the burden. Mayor Adams calls his commitment 'steadfast.' Car owners protest. Residents and businesses cling to rare safe space. Equity promised, but city support remains thin.</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2022, the city announced an expansion of the Open Streets program, adding 21 new locations to the existing 156. Mayor Adams, in a statement, called his commitment to the program 'steadfast.' The announcement pledges up to $20,000 per site for non-profits to cover costs like barriers and signage. The program, launched during the pandemic, lets residents walk and gather in streets closed to cars. Council action is not specified, but the mayor's office leads. The city promises to focus on underserved neighborhoods, aiming for equity. Still, most operations rely on volunteers, not city workers. Car owners protest the loss of parking. The Horticultural Society of New York will assist with management and upkeep. The city’s support is real but limited. Vulnerable road users get space, but the system leans on unpaid labor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
