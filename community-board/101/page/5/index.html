One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette.

Brooklyn’s first Regional Slow Zone targets crowded streets. Ten severe injuries and one death in five years haunt the area. Council Member Restler and DOT push for slower traffic. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2025, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced the lowering of Dumbo’s speed limit to 20 mph, making it Brooklyn’s first Regional Slow Zone. The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, required by the City Council, reveals the city missed mandates for protected bike lanes (29.3 of 50 miles) and bus lanes (17.9 of 30 miles) for the third year running. The matter summary states: 'New York City has failed to meet legally required benchmarks for redesigning streets for bikes, buses, and pedestrians due to a lack of resources and political interference.' Mayor Eric Adams is named as the main obstacle. The report cites staff shortages, shrinking divisions, and political pushback—especially the mayor’s role in killing the Fordham Road busway. Former DOT commissioner Polly Trottenberg warned the plan needed more funding and a new approach. Advocates and officials say Adams’s lack of support left the city’s most vulnerable road users exposed. The law’s promise is broken.

The plan, discussed in both Senate and Assembly one-house budgets, suggests new taxes: fees on online deliveries, higher payroll mobility taxes, and more surcharges on rideshare trips. The matter summary reads: 'Taxes to back the MTA? That is what some New York lawmakers are proposing.' Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key figure. Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie previously rejected the MTA’s $68.4 billion plan last December over funding gaps. The proposal has sparked public anger, with advocates and riders decrying more taxes. MTA chair Janno Lieber insists full funding is essential to keep trains and buses running safely.

The change, reported by Streetsblog NYC, limits car-free hours to Saturdays only from May to September—a 50 percent cut from last year’s already reduced schedule. The program, once a weekend staple from spring to fall, now faces its smallest footprint yet. Alex Morano, a volunteer organizer, called the rollback 'really unfortunate,' stressing the street’s value to the neighborhood. Saskia Haegens, Chair of the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Corporation, urged full city funding, saying the program is 'transformative.' Organizers blame insufficient city support, with less than half the cost covered this year. The Department of Transportation claims $10 million in annual support and promises a permanent redesign, but for now, cars win back space.

Hochul faces pressure to let New York City charge for residential street parking. The plan targets illegal registrations, raises MTA funds, and could cut traffic. Critics say current rules reward fraud and endanger cyclists. Reform means fewer cars, safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 20, 2025, an editorial published by Streetsblog NYC called for Governor Hochul and state leaders to grant New York City the authority to create citywide, resident-only parking zones. The piece, titled 'Gov. Hochul Could Transform Our City with Parking Reform,' argues, 'With permission from the state, New York City could enact a citywide, resident-only parking system. Non-residents needn’t be banned from parking here, just charged for it, with the money going to the MTA.' The editorial highlights rampant illegal vehicle registrations and the dangers they pose, including uninsured cars and increased risk for cyclists. The proposal urges charging both residents and visitors for parking, with higher rates in dense, wealthy areas. The plan aims to reduce congestion, generate MTA revenue, and reclaim curb space for safer uses. No council member is directly named, as this is an opinion piece, but the call is clear: state action is needed to protect vulnerable road users and restore trust in public space management.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets clear, but danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On February 13, 2025, the MTA reported results from its Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) expansion, which began in August 2024. The program, described as 'bus-mounted camera tickets to drivers who double-park along bus routes or park in bus stops,' has issued over 400,000 tickets in five months. The ACE system grew from 623 buses on 14 routes to 1,000 buses on 34 routes by November. MTA spokesperson Laura Cala-Rauch said the program 'is having a big impact on speeding buses and improving the quality of life for New Yorkers.' Data from Jehiah Czebotar shows cameras now issue 76.4% of bus lane and stop tickets—93% by December. Bus speeds rose 5%, crashes involving buses dropped 20%, and emissions fell up to 10%. Persistent violators remain, with some drivers racking up five tickets. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called for escalating fines and legislative changes to target repeat offenders. The ACE program marks a shift toward automated, consistent enforcement, but loopholes for chronic blockers persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pine urged the Council to oppose the bill, warning that victims of traffic violence would be left financially devastated. Transportation Alternatives’ Ben Furnas also opposed the bill, stating, 'This legislation will ultimately make it more expensive and difficult to access care, treatment, and support after a traffic crash.'

Promised bus lanes never come. Mayor Adams broke his pledge. The city built just 9.6 miles in two years. Riders wait. DOT blames funding. Council law ignored. Streets stay deadly. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, released February 7, 2025, by the Independent Budget Office, exposes the city’s failure to meet the Streets Master Plan law (passed in 2019) mandating 150 miles of new bus lanes. The IBO states: 'It will be virtually impossible for the city to meet the City Council's required 150 miles of new bus lanes at the pace Mayor Adams is going.' Mayor Adams, who took office in 2022, has slowed or killed key bus projects, including the Fordham Road busway. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno claims the agency is building protected lanes and using cameras for enforcement, but admits resources are tight. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has called for compliance but not funded it. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein blames hiring freezes and political interference for 'broken promises and neglected legislation.' The report shows that while DOT’s budget grew, staffing for bus lane expansion fell. Bus speeds remain stuck at 8.1 mph.
