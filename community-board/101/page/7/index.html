Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk.

Most streets stay risky.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2024, the NYC Department of Transportation announced it will use new powers from Sammy's Law to lower speed limits from 25 to 20 mph on 49 street segments starting September 2024, with 201 more to follow by late 2025. The measure covers just 0.13% of city streets, possibly reaching 0.8% if regional slow zones expand. The first such zone will be south of Canal Street in lower Manhattan. DOT can only lower limits street by street unless the City Council acts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confirmed no citywide bill exists. Council Member Christopher Marte welcomed the slow zone in his district, citing rampant speeding off the bridges. Advocates and officials demand faster, broader action, saying, 'Twenty is plenty wherever you'll find people, and in New York that's everywhere.' DOT says it will prioritize areas near schools and neighborhoods with more non-white and low-income residents. The rollout is slow. Most streets remain unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
