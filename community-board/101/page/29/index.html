A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report covers July through October 2022 and cites 'fewer contractors available, shortages in installation materials, and general political opposition' as reasons for a 42% drop in bike lane miles and a 47% drop in bus lane miles compared to the previous year. Streetsblog’s coverage, criticized by City Hall and DOT, revealed that vacancies and political interference—especially from Council Members Bob Holden and Oswald Feliz—stalled projects like the Citi Bike expansion in Queens and the Fordham Road bus lane in the Bronx. DOT completed only 67% of its bus lane mandate and fell 17% short on bike lanes. The city’s own numbers now confirm what advocates warned: delays and obstruction put vulnerable road users in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter focused on the administration’s failure to meet Council-mandated benchmarks in the NYC Streets Plan, especially protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers stated, 'No New Yorker should have to fear for their life while crossing or using our streets.' She stressed that enforcement alone is not enough, demanding equitable infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods.

The project, begun in September 2021 and finished last fall, added 1,285 square feet of sidewalk, a new median, and red bus-only lanes on Westchester Avenue. The DOT worked with the MTA to cut a circuitous bus detour, giving Bx12 and other riders a direct path. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'DOT’s work at Pelham Bay Park... may be only one-10th of a mile, but the impact for thousands of riders will be gigantic.' New York City Transit President Richard Davey added, 'Bus lanes don't have to be miles long to deliver a huge impact.' The changes serve 64,000 daily riders, expanding space for pedestrians and shortening bus trips.

The law, named after Carlos Moncayo, aims to curb a surge in construction worker deaths—22 in the past year, the highest in five years. State Sen. Jessica Ramos, representing District 13, called the law 'critically needed' as thousands of migrants enter non-union construction jobs lacking basic safety protections. Ramos and other lawmakers supported the bill, but advocates and union officials warn that without strong enforcement and education for new arrivals, deaths and injuries will persist. The law passed after years of advocacy, but the minimum fine was removed, and nonprofits struggle to train the influx of new workers.

The article centers on Ian Lockwood, a sustainable transportation expert, who was hit by a truck towing a boat while cycling. Lockwood blames road markings, not the driver, saying, 'I blame it on that yellow line.' He criticizes the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for prioritizing speed over safety, stating, 'They're there to make them faster.' Lockwood argues that traffic controls shift blame onto vulnerable users and do not guarantee safety. He supports Vision Zero and shared space designs, which slow traffic and reduce crashes. The critique calls for fewer big arterials and less reliance on signage, focusing instead on eliminating dangerous road features.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Witnesses described the SUV smashing through a concrete barrier and fence before falling onto the tracks, estimating speeds of 30 to 40 miles per hour. The NYPD initially suggested a 'medical episode' but later dropped this claim, despite a pattern of police blaming unexplained crashes on health issues. The vehicle’s license plate had 13 speeding violations since 2019, including four in the past year. No council bill or committee action is attached to this event.
