A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow.

The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings.

It allows more crosswalks, green bike lanes, and transit lanes. But it still puts cars first. Pedestrians and cyclists remain at risk. The rules demand human perfection, not safer streets. The danger continues.</p><p class=mb3>On December 2023, the Federal Highway Administration released the 11th Edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), the first update since 2009. This federal document, over 1,000 pages, sets the standards for road markings, signals, and signs nationwide. The update, described as 'important steps toward a safer, more people-focused transportation system,' modernizes speed zone setting and allows more crosswalks, green bike lanes, and red transit lanes. But it still falls short. The MUTCD expects pedestrians and cyclists to act 'alertly and attentively,' ignoring human error and the diversity of street users. It keeps high barriers for pedestrian signals and prioritizes car movement over safety. The new section on autonomous vehicles raises concerns about streets being built for machines, not people. No council members are named; this is a federal action. Advocates and cities submitted over 25,000 comments demanding stronger reforms. The next update is due by December 2027.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He argued, 'Congestion pricing alone will not reduce traffic to its fullest potential. Central business district tolling should absolutely be coupled with massive increases and improvements in public transit service.' Samuelsen criticized the MTA for not expanding service and called the toll 'classist.' His stance shifted from earlier support in 2019 to strong opposition, citing unmet promises and risks to transit funding. No council bill or committee action is noted.

The report cites 'Following Too Closely' as a contributing factor alongside 'Other Vehicular' causes. The point of impact was the center back end of the pick-up truck and the center front end of the BMW SUV, indicating a rear-end collision sequence. No victim fault or pedestrian involvement is noted. The crash highlights driver error in maintaining safe distance during turning maneuvers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Governor Kathy Hochul pledged to 'fight to secure as much funding as possible.' The MTA expects $14 billion from the federal government, $8 billion from Albany and the city, and $13 billion from its own debt, leaving a $33 billion gap for the state to fill.

Thirty-two business owners petitioned DOT to halt the project, citing truck maneuvering dangers.

The move slashed $15 billion from transit budgets, threatening repairs and upgrades. Hochul claimed to act for cost-of-living relief, but polling shows her approval at a record low. Republicans seized credit for the pause, while Democrats saw no political gain. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called it sabotage: 'Governor Kathy Hochul took a gamble when she sabotaged our public transit system for political gain and she lost dearly.' The MTA now faces a $33 billion shortfall for its next plan. No new revenue source is in place. The legislature, as Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany notes, already did its job by passing the law.

The article, titled '‘Doom Loop’ Alert: Transit Systems are Suffering — And Too Many Are Cutting Service,' chronicles how pandemic relief funds are running dry, ridership lags, and costs soar. Governor Kathy Hochul killed congestion pricing, stripping the MTA of $1 billion a year. Now, the agency slashes repair programs. Streetsblog quotes transit leaders warning that service cuts mean crowded buses, more cars, and lost productivity. Council members and mayors in cities like Miami and Philadelphia face similar choices. The story makes clear: when transit fails, vulnerable road users—those who walk, bike, or rely on buses—face greater risk.

Governor Hochul’s decision to halt congestion pricing drew sharp criticism from advocates. Sara Lind, Co-Executive Director of Open Plans, called the move 'disastrous,' warning that abandoning congestion pricing is a 'dereliction of duty' on street safety.
