The policy, passed by the Legislature in 2019, was set to begin within weeks. It would have charged drivers entering Manhattan’s core, raising $1 billion yearly for transit repairs and upgrades. Hochul’s decision, made without legislative action, drew sharp criticism. Jumaane Williams, NYC Public Advocate, warned of 'irreparable harm to the city.' Natasha Elder of NYPIRG said, 'Gov. Hochul's decision to delay congestion pricing tells subway and bus riders they don't rank.' Advocates like the Tri-State Transportation Campaign called for 'bold, strong leadership.' The cancellation leaves the city’s streets jammed and transit funding gutted, with no relief for those most at risk: people on foot, on bikes, and on buses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Protected lanes for kids and cyclists, gone. Homeowners waved signs. Parking won. Only a short stretch gets protection. The rest: paint and sharrows. Schools left exposed. Safety traded for curbside convenience. Another promise broken. Riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>""I expected DOT to follow through on what they committed to... They’re falling behind on their Streets Plan [bike lane construction] targets so I would expect them to want to install every bit of protected bike lane they had already committed to."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On June 5, 2024, the Department of Transportation (DOT) reversed course on a two-year-old plan to build protected bike lanes in northeast Queens. The project, once set to connect schools with safe cycling routes, will now feature mostly unprotected lanes and sharrows along 46th Avenue. Only a small segment between Springfield Boulevard and Cloverdale Boulevard will have a protected lane in one direction. DOT cited the need to 'maintain current curbside activities,' meaning parking. Community Board 11 had opposed the original plan, and homeowners rallied with 'NO BIKE LANES' signs and an 800-signature petition. Advocates like Laura Shepard and Elizabeth Adams condemned the rollback, saying, 'We can't let politics get in the way of saving lives.' Ben Turner criticized the prioritization of parking over safety, noting most homes already have driveways. The changes leave children and cyclists exposed, undermining the city's own Streets Master Plan targets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay risky for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 4, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on commercial waste zone implementation and contractor selection. The hearing spotlighted the Commercial Waste Zones law, which aims to cut crashes by limiting private trash haulers in each zone. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, author of the 2019 reform, and Council Member Shaun Abreu led the charge, questioning why companies like Cogent Waste Solutions—with poor safety records—were awarded contracts. Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial. Lawmakers condemned the city for putting cost before safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council members question why a company with such a record still hauls trash in city zones. The city’s new waste program promises stricter oversight, but danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2024, the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) appointed an independent monitor for Cogent Waste Solutions, a private carting firm with a deadly safety record. The move comes before the city’s new Commercial Waste Zone program launches this fall. Council Members Shaun Abreu and Sandy Nurse raised alarms, asking, 'how the city awarded a contract to a company with a history of endangering workers to begin with.' Cogent’s trucks have killed one, injured four, and racked up hundreds of violations. Despite this, DSNY allowed Cogent to win contracts in four waste zones. DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.' The oversight hearing exposes a system that lets reckless firms operate, even as new rules loom.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, led by the NJ Turnpike Authority, faces criticism for ignoring alternatives like mass transit, greenways, and bikeways. The article states: 'Gov. Phil Murphy wants to spend over $10 billion to widen a highway in an environmental justice community while asking transit riders to shoulder a 15 percent fare hike. That is unjust and unacceptable.' The Turnpike Authority held limited public sessions, excluded on-the-record comments, and failed to address induced demand or environmental justice. The piece urges federal agencies to reject the project, arguing it will worsen pollution, noise, and health outcomes for vulnerable residents. The author calls for investment in safer, more sustainable transportation instead.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, revealed by DOT Director Ted Wright, creates a 'bike boulevard' with two-way protected bike lanes from Steinway Street to Vernon Boulevard. The plan shifts the avenue to one-way car traffic, adds painted pedestrian islands, curb extensions, and may include a car-free plaza. DOT aims to reduce vehicle presence and traffic violence, responding to local advocacy after several high-profile crashes. Residents and organizers, including Alana Herlands and John Surico, voiced strong support: 'We are going to advocate for the most ambitious plan that not only adds more space for the community... but also reduces traffic violence.'

The DOT had pledged to convert a car lane into a two-way protected bike path by fall 2023, but the project remains unfinished.

The biggest gains come in dense city neighborhoods. Diesel buses choke streets with toxic air. Electric buses could clear the air and save lives.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2024, a Carnegie Mellon University study analyzed the impact of electrifying America’s bus fleet. The report, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found that replacing diesel buses with electric models could cut 40 million metric tons of greenhouse gases by 2035. The study summary states, 'America would reap massive public health and emissions-reduction benefits from electrifying its bus fleet.' Researcher Sofia Martinez said, 'We definitely need to be advocates for electrification, and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants in any way we can.' The study urges more federal subsidies to speed up the transition. Even replacing aging diesel buses as they retire would cut 35 million tons of CO2. The report stresses the greatest public health gains would come from electrifying buses in the most densely populated neighborhoods, where diesel pollution hits hardest. The study calls for urgent action to protect city dwellers from toxic air.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council and DOT hold the power. Advocates say language matters. Streets remain deadly. Action lags. Lives hang in balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 8, 2024, Mayor Eric Adams publicly supported lowering speed limits after the passage of 'Sammy’s Law,' which allows New York City to reduce limits to 20 mph on most roads. The law, passed in the state budget, excludes wide, multi-lane roads in the outer boroughs. Adams said, 'I do believe as New Yorkers we need to slow down,' but repeatedly referred to preventable crashes as 'accidents,' a term advocates reject for removing driver responsibility. The City Council must legislate any citywide speed limit change, while the Department of Transportation (DOT) can adjust limits on specific streets after community input. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Speaker Adrienne Adams pledged to 'collaborate and negotiate' with City Hall. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi stressed the need for street redesign and legal reform, noting, 'This is not a problem that goes away on its own.' Despite new authority, the Adams administration has lagged on safe street infrastructure. The city faces its deadliest start to a year in the Vision Zero era, with 60 killed in the first quarter.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
