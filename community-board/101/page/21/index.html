A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

This incident marked the 29th cyclist fatality in 2023, a grim milestone in a year of rising traffic violence. Brooks-Powers criticized the Adams administration and the Department of Transportation for failing to meet the Streets Plan's legal requirement of 50 miles of protected bike lanes, achieving only about 30 miles. She stated, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Brooks-Powers also condemned the missed bus lane targets and called out DOT's lack of transparency, pledging to hold the agency accountable and push for safer, more equitable streets. The city faces more cars, more crashes, and more injuries, while vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more waiting. No more trade-offs. Commissioner Tisch says every street gets cleared together. Cyclists will not be left stranded in snow. The city finally treats bike lanes as vital.</p><p class=mb3>On December 21, 2023, the Department of Sanitation announced a major shift in snow removal policy. Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch declared, “For the first time the plan calls for doing both at the same time, rather than prioritizing one over the other or making trade-offs.” This policy change ends years of prioritizing car lanes over bike lanes for snow clearance. The agency updated its annual snow plan and hired 563 new workers, now able to dispatch plows for all routes simultaneously. The new approach means protected bike lanes—165 miles worth—will be cleared alongside roads, not after. Tisch emphasized, “Every street in the city is on a route and we are staffed to dispatch every route at the same time. Prioritization of certain streets is a thing of the past.” Advocates, including Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, praised the move as overdue and vital for cyclists’ safety. The city’s snow fleet now includes smaller plows fit for bike lanes, ending the era of neglect.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, shaped by advocacy campaigns, was summarized as offering 'more flexibility to design roads safely,' but advocates say it is 'a transitional document; it’s not a transformational document.' FHWA Administrator Shailen Bhatt claimed the update empowers cities to prioritize active transportation, stating, 'The cities that are really thriving... are the ones who are really putting active transportation at the forefront.' However, advocates like Mike McGinn and Beth Osborne criticized the weak reforms to the 85th percentile speed rule and the lack of bold safety mandates. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law now requires updates every four years, giving hope for future, stronger reforms. For now, the MUTCD still leaves vulnerable road users at risk, with only incremental gains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, shaped by two years of outreach, proposes 121 routes—eight more than before—but cuts and combines stops, aiming for straighter lines and faster trips. The matter summary states the redesign seeks 'improved travel speed and reliability.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, voiced 'serious concerns about the proposal’s impact on her constituents, especially with the looming arrival of congestion pricing.' She called for an 'equitable and balanced' approach. The plan faces backlash over wider stop spacing and fewer stops, which could force longer walks for riders—many of them elderly or disabled.

The matter summary states the bill aims to 'protect against the risk of fires.' Torres and advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project pushed for app-based companies to supply certified batteries, but tech giants oppose this. Kavanagh said, 'A strong federal standard for lithium-ion batteries is required to ensure public safety.' Despite new laws, the cost of safe batteries—up to $5,000—still falls on low-paid delivery workers. Sixteen people have died in 253 battery fires this year.

The plan, now entering a 60-day public review, sets a $15 daytime toll for drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The matter, titled 'Don’t expect changes to MTA's congestion pricing even after final public review,' underscores the board's resistance to major changes. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'If you change one aspect – the whole thing starts to unravel or fall apart.' Council Member Robert F. Holden was mentioned in the discussion. The board is reconsidering tolls on school buses, but most exemptions are opposed. Lawsuits from New Jersey officials threaten delays. The plan’s fate hangs on legal and public scrutiny, but for now, the structure stands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 16, 2023, the Portland City Council unanimously passed a resolution targeting the Gorham Connector highway project. The matter, described as a call to 'stop its work on the highway until rapid transit options have been properly examined,' urges the Maine Turnpike Authority to pause construction. Council members cited climate change and Maine’s emissions goals, demanding transit and land-use reforms come first. The council’s action follows a 2012 study warning that new roads alone won’t fix traffic. Local groups like GrowSmart Maine and businesses such as Smiling Hill Farm oppose the project, fearing it will worsen sprawl and pollution. Despite council opposition and federal funding for transit studies, the Turnpike Authority continues land acquisition and environmental reviews. Vulnerable road users face increased risk if the highway moves forward without transit alternatives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders wait. Promises break. Advocates demand real bus rapid transit: center lanes, fast boarding, tough enforcement. Without action, the city’s buses crawl. Vulnerable riders pay the price in time and danger.</p><p class=mb3>This Streetsblog NYC analysis, published November 13, 2023, examines New York’s failure to deliver true Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). The article, titled 'Want More Rapid Bus Transit? Build Real Bus Rapid Transit,' criticizes Mayor Adams for not following through on campaign pledges to expand bus lanes and implement full BRT. Advocates like Annie Weinstock and JP Patafio argue that dedicated center-running lanes, off-board fare collection, and strict enforcement are needed to speed up buses and protect riders. The piece notes, 'Current bus lanes, like on Utica [Avenue], really it’s almost like a parking lot, because they cover the plates and there’s no enforcement.' The report highlights that without strong leadership and commitment, bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—remain exposed to slow service and street danger. No council bill number or committee is attached; this is a policy analysis and advocacy call to action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lane, long promised and long dangerous, remains unbuilt. Ossé demanded action. Cyclists keep dying. DOT offered no timeline. The city’s failure leaves lives at risk.</p><p class=mb3>""The bike lane has strong community support, and its benefits are obvious. This failure is yet another glaring example of the administration falling far behind on its commitments to develop bicycle infrastructure in our city."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On November 2, 2023, Council Member Chi Ossé publicly criticized the Department of Transportation for delaying the protected bike lane project on Bedford Avenue. The project, which was supposed to upgrade a painted lane to a parking-protected lane, has been pushed to at least next spring. Ossé wrote to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, calling the delay 'unacceptable' and demanding a firm installation date. He stated, 'The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.' Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, echoed his frustration, citing record cyclist deaths and urgent need for safety. The DOT has not responded to requests for comment. The delay highlights the city’s repeated failures to deliver promised street safety improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
