A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Human-scaled mobility deserves respect, not diminishment.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published June 12, 2023, on Streetsblog NYC, challenges the use of the term ‘micromobility’ to describe bikes, scooters, and similar vehicles. The article argues, ‘SUVs, pick-up trucks, and passenger cars should not be the benchmark by which we judge the size of other forms of transit, and the term 'micromobility' encourages us to believe that they are.’ Author Sarah Risser calls for dropping the ‘micro’ prefix, urging us to see bikes and scooters as standard, not lesser. She highlights how oversized vehicles—cars, SUVs, trucks—fuel rising deaths among pedestrians and cyclists. Risser urges language that centers human-scaled mobility and rejects car supremacy. No council bill or vote is attached, but the stance is clear: words shape safety, and the right words can help dismantle systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation will conduct a traffic study before starting the environmental review, pushing construction to late 2027. The matter, titled 'City delays BQE construction to conduct traffic study, says roadway is ‘safe’ amid interim repairs,' highlights the city’s claim that interim repairs will keep the road safe until at least 2028. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, voiced concern about the delay and the city’s ability to finish the project. Community Visioning Council members were not told in advance.

The move could make bike-share easier, but fractured agencies and costly upgrades stand in the way.</p><p class=mb3>On June 8, 2023, State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Midtown West) urged the MTA and Lyft to integrate OMNY, the city’s contactless fare system, with Citi Bike. In a letter, Hoylman-Sigal wrote, "We urge you to create a unified payment system as expeditiously as possible." The proposal aims to remove barriers for would-be Citi Bike users and address issues like vandalized QR codes. The bill is a policy proposal, not yet in committee or up for a vote. Hoylman-Sigal’s push highlights the fractured nature of New York’s fare systems, with separate payments for subways, bikes, ferries, and regional trains. While OMNY integration could streamline access, technical and financial hurdles remain. The MTA and Cubic, OMNY’s contractor, say they are reviewing expansion opportunities.

The piece, titled 'Feds Must Give Transit the Support (And Flexibility) It Needs Right Now,' demands Congress let transit agencies use federal funds for operating costs, not just capital projects. Regan warns, 'This flaw in federal policy is squeezing communities around the country.' He highlights looming service cuts in cities like New York, Boston, and Atlanta. Regan opposes current restrictions and supports permanent change. The opinion, published in Streetsblog NYC, reflects labor’s stance: without operational funding, transit shrinks, and vulnerable riders—those who walk, bike, or rely on buses and trains—face greater risk.

Family and advocates say the plan skips key safety fixes. Jersey barriers leave gaps. Pedestrian islands and bike signals are missing. The city delays. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) latest redesign proposal for Ninth Street in Gowanus drew fire at a Community Board 6 meeting. The plan, discussed in the Transportation and Public Safety Committees, adds buffer-protected bike lanes and some jersey barriers, but skips driveways and omits pedestrian islands, raised intersections, and bicycle signals. Maxime Le Munier, whose wife Sarah Schick was killed by a truck driver on Ninth Street, said, “What we want is to guarantee everyone’s safety, and it seems like it’s going to fall short.” Community Board 6 Transportation Chair Doug Gordon and Public Safety Chair Jerry Armer echoed calls for stronger, faster action. Council Member Hanif hosted a recent event on the issue. The committees unanimously approved the DOT proposal with conditions: more pedestrian safety, more traffic calming, and a comprehensive plan for all of Ninth Street. DOT has not set a timeline. Schick’s family is suing the city for $100 million, alleging negligence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The $2.6-million, seven-block overhaul—managed by the Parks Department—targets the cracked 1894 path between avenues R and X. Construction, delayed by the pandemic and contract issues, will continue through March 2024. The Parks Department closed the northernmost block but failed to provide a safe, legal detour for cyclists, leaving them to navigate dangerous service roads and unclear signage. Treyger celebrated the start on social media, thanking advocates. Jon Orcutt of Bike New York criticized Parks for slow, unsafe detour practices, saying, 'They should be working on it based on function.'

The plan, passed by the state legislature in 2019, remains stuck in federal review. Komanoff suggests, 'let’s give every household in the 12-county MTA region a single untolled trip per month into the congestion zone.' He argues this would address fairness concerns and soften opposition from occasional drivers. The freebie would cut annual net revenues by $110 million, but Komanoff says this could be offset by raising tolls for regular commuters. The proposal aims to preserve congestion pricing’s core goals: less traffic, faster travel, and more funding for transit. Komanoff’s compromise seeks to break the political stalemate and keep the city moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

MTA data shows a 25 percent drop in collisions and faster buses on enforced routes. Riders gain time. Streets grow safer. Delivery giants rack up tickets. The city lags on bus lane promises.</p><p class=mb3>On April 25, 2023, the City Council held a hearing on bus lane enforcement and service improvements. The matter, titled 'SMILE! Bus Lane Cameras Reduce Collisions, Speed Commutes, MTA Says,' highlighted MTA data: routes with automated bus lane enforcement (ABLE) saw 25 percent fewer crashes and 5 percent faster bus speeds over four years. MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey testified, calling camera enforcement 'one of the most efficient and effective tools at our disposal.' MTA board member Andrew Albert pushed for more dedicated lanes, while CEO Janno Lieber urged Mayor Adams to meet legal bus lane minimums. The MTA aims to expand cameras to 1,000 buses, covering 80 percent of lanes. The city DOT has fallen behind on required bus lane mileage. Delivery firms like Amazon and UPS are frequent offenders. The MTA is also redesigning routes and reallocating dispatchers to cut bus bunching. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the data shows clear benefits for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

If you ask a parent if they would like to have this technology in their cars for their teenagers, I would venture to guess almost every parent would say yes. If we want it for our teenagers, we should want it for everyone—because everyone is sharing the roads with each other."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On April 20, 2023, a coalition of transportation advocates launched the Safer Fleets Challenge, urging 50 U.S. communities to install Intelligent Speed Assist (ISA) technology on municipal vehicles by 2025. The campaign, highlighted in a Streetsblog NYC article, states: 'Some of America's most prominent sustainable transportation advocacy organizations are challenging governments to embrace a ground-breaking technology that makes it impossible for drivers to speed, starting with the vehicles in their own fleets.' Former council member Erica Gilmore and America Walks president Mike McGinn voiced strong support. Gilmore said, 'Greater safety, of course, would lead to budget savings over the long run for cities and towns.' The article details ISA pilots in New York City and California, showing fewer crashes and less speeding. Advocates argue that executive orders can quickly retrofit fleets, and broader adoption is overdue. The bill is not yet formal legislation but marks a clear push for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 19, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams endorsed a pilot to make two bus routes free in each borough, totaling ten free buses. The plan is part of the 'Fix the MTA' package, originally championed by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and progressive allies. Adams said, 'I strongly support the thought of having 10 buses being free on lines in the city. I think it would make a major impact.' Mamdani called free buses 'transformative' for working-class New Yorkers. Despite this, other bus improvements lag. Adams pledged 150 miles of new bus lanes in four years, but only 11.95 miles were built last year. Some projects stalled amid political opposition. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber stressed the need for city commitment to bus lanes and warned of fare hikes and service cuts if funding gaps persist.
