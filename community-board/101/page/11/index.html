A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable users wait.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Transportation’s Smart Curbs pilot, updated October 29, 2024, aims to convert free parking to paid meters and add delivery microhubs on the Upper West Side. The plan, first proposed in June, promised about 200 new metered spots and 27 loading zones, but only 175 free spaces—one-tenth of the area’s 1,700—will be removed. Microhubs, meant to reduce double-parking and delivery chaos, are delayed until next year. DOT spokespersons Vin Barone and Mona Bruno confirmed most changes are just reassignments, not true removals of free parking. Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS called the slow pace disappointing: “We’ve been super eager to see these changes, see what their impact is and start measuring and observing, so it’s a little disappointing.” Parking expert Donald Shoup urged the city to reinvest meter revenue locally, but DOT declined. The pilot leaves most curb space for cars, not people. Vulnerable road users see little relief.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, covered in committee and public statements, is described as 'transformative for so many New Yorkers.' Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who represents the area, had threatened to oppose the IBX if it included street-running. After the MTA’s shift to tunneling, Holden stated, 'Addressing the biggest issue by forgoing light rail on 69th Street is crucial to earning our support.' The plan eliminates a dangerous section where trams would have mixed with cars, reducing exposure for pedestrians and cyclists. The MTA has issued a request for proposals to design the line and guide it through federal review. The $5.5 billion project’s funding remains uncertain, but the tunnel plan removes a major safety concern for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Morano references the death of Kamari Hughes as a tragic example of the city’s failure. He writes, 'New York City should no longer be an exception when it comes to intersection safety.' Morano urges state lawmakers to enforce daylighting standards citywide, arguing that the current exemption leaves pedestrians at risk.

The report, not tied to a council bill but crucial for transit policy, states: 'The MTA can't take on any more debt to fill the hole...without dramatically jacking up fares or cutting service.' DiNapoli’s analysis shows that borrowing $15 billion now, plus $13 billion more for the next plan, would force a 16 percent fare hike by 2037. He notes the MTA’s finances are already strained by weak real estate taxes and slow ridership recovery. DiNapoli opposes fare hikes and service cuts, backing congestion pricing and state support instead. He stresses that without new, reliable revenue, vulnerable riders will pay the price. The warning is clear: more debt means danger for those who depend on transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, titled 'The Effects of 'Buy American': Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act,' analyzes the full societal costs of electric vehicles (EVs) versus gasoline vehicles (GVs). The study finds, 'U.S. electric vehicles are only slightly less harmful to the environment and society than conventional gasoline cars.' The analysis aggregates climate damage, crash deaths, and pollution. It reveals that EVs’ heavier weight leads to more fatal crashes, and their battery production is energy-intensive. Charging EVs on carbon-heavy grids causes six times more harmful pollution than gas tailpipes. The authors conclude that, factoring in all harms, EVs are only 10 percent less damaging than GVs. The report urges policymakers to reconsider subsidies and warns that the real-world toll of cars—electric or not—remains immense.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The update, described as 'important steps toward a safer, more people-focused transportation system,' modernizes speed zone setting and allows more crosswalks, green bike lanes, and red transit lanes. But it still falls short. The MUTCD expects pedestrians and cyclists to act 'alertly and attentively,' ignoring human error and the diversity of street users. It keeps high barriers for pedestrian signals and prioritizes car movement over safety. The new section on autonomous vehicles raises concerns about streets being built for machines, not people. No council members are named; this is a federal action. Advocates and cities submitted over 25,000 comments demanding stronger reforms. The next update is due by December 2027.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, details Samuelsen’s resignation from the Traffic Mobility Review Board on November 30, 2023, the day tolling recommendations were released. He argued, 'Congestion pricing alone will not reduce traffic to its fullest potential. Central business district tolling should absolutely be coupled with massive increases and improvements in public transit service.' Samuelsen criticized the MTA for not expanding service and called the toll 'classist.' His stance shifted from earlier support in 2019 to strong opposition, citing unmet promises and risks to transit funding. No council bill or committee action is noted. The union’s move leaves vulnerable road users facing the same old dangers: crowded streets, slow buses, and stalled safety reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision involved a 2011 Ford pick-up truck, a 2020 Chevrolet SUV, and a 2024 BMW SUV, all traveling south. The BMW was going straight ahead, while the other two vehicles were making right turns. The driver of the pick-up truck, a 48-year-old male, suffered head injuries and whiplash but was conscious and not ejected. The report cites 'Following Too Closely' as a contributing factor alongside 'Other Vehicular' causes. The point of impact was the center back end of the pick-up truck and the center front end of the BMW SUV, indicating a rear-end collision sequence. No victim fault or pedestrian involvement is noted. The crash highlights driver error in maintaining safe distance during turning maneuvers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Pedestrians now cross anywhere, any time. No summons. Law strips drivers of excuses. Streets shift. Power tilts to people on foot.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now enacted, rewrites New York’s pedestrian rules. The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, described as 'the biggest in the MTA's history,' now awaits review by a panel with appointees from the governor, legislative leaders, and the NYC mayor. Andrea Stewart-Cousins is mentioned in connection with the event. MTA Chair Janno Lieber stressed the plan's aim to 'protect riders from a decline in service due to infrastructure that’s been...neglected or left unfixed.' Governor Kathy Hochul pledged to 'fight to secure as much funding as possible.' The MTA expects $14 billion from the federal government, $8 billion from Albany and the city, and $13 billion from its own debt, leaving a $33 billion gap for the state to fill. The plan’s fate will shape the safety and reliability of transit for millions of New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Five killed, 170 injured in five years. Councilwoman Julie Won backs the plan. Truckers and owners protest. DOT pushes forward. Streets stay deadly. Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The controversy centers on a planned bike lane in Queens’ District 26, championed by Councilwoman Julie Won. The city aims to connect the Pulaski and Kosciuszko bridges via Borden, Starr, and Review avenues. The project, requested by local civic groups and the community board, follows five deaths—including two cyclists—and over 170 injuries on these roads in five years. Won stated, 'We need to do everything we can to ensure we don’t lose another life to a preventable death.' Thirty-two business owners petitioned DOT to halt the project, citing truck maneuvering dangers. DOT representative Vincent Barone called the route 'a critical gap' in the bike network and promised 'much-needed safety improvements.' The plan will take up to 15 feet from Review Avenue for a two-way bike path and buffer, leaving 22 feet for traffic. The fight underscores the city’s struggle to protect vulnerable road users in truck-heavy corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
