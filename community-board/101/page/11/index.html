A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A taxi, traveling north and making a left turn, collided with a northbound bicyclist going straight ahead. The point of impact was the taxi’s left front bumper and the bike’s center front end. The bicyclist, a 30-year-old male, was injured with head trauma and contusions but was conscious and not ejected from his bike. The report explicitly lists the taxi driver’s failure to yield right-of-way as the contributing factor. The bicyclist was not wearing any safety equipment, but this was not cited as a contributing factor. The taxi driver was licensed and operating a 2020 vehicle registered in New York.

The plan, discussed before the Community Board, would add a bus lane and a protected bike lane. DOT calls the corridor a Vision Zero Priority Corridor, citing 430 injuries from 2019 to 2023, including deaths and serious harm to cyclists and pedestrians. DOT's Rosy Doud said, 'We’re really seeing a need here to make some safety improvements.' Board member Kenneth Crouch supported protected lanes, while Chair Jose Altamirano pushed to limit parking loss. Delivery worker Naquan described drivers 'always trying to run me off the road.'

Hoylman-Sigal supports lowering the toll, saying, 'The goal should be mend it don’t end it.' He urges keeping the program alive to save mass transit. Sen. Liz Krueger is open to tweaks if goals are met. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow opposes any revival. The MTA faces a $15 billion shortfall after the program’s pause.

Advocates want more.</p><p class=mb3>On June 28, 2024, the City Council expanded the Fair Fares MetroCard program, raising eligibility from 120% to 145% of the federal poverty line. The change, part of the Fiscal Year 2025 budget, was championed by Council Finance Chair Justin Brannan. The bill increases access for individuals earning up to $21,837 and families of four earning $45,240. The council added $10 million in funding, bringing the total to over $100 million annually. Brannan and economist James Parrott wrote, 'By expanding the reach of Fair Fares, we can ensure that all New Yorkers—particularly those who are already struggling during a crisis of affordability—can fully participate in the economic, social, and cultural opportunities of our city.' The expansion boosts eligibility from 932,000 to just over 1 million people. Advocates and Speaker Adrienne Adams say it is a win, but still short of the 200% threshold they seek.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA board approved the pause, forcing a $16 billion cut in capital spending. Projects delayed include modern signals, station accessibility, new trains, and electric buses. The plan, crafted by former NYC Transit President Andy Byford, aimed to fix decades of neglect. Byford said, 'The Fast Forward plan we created in 2018 is as necessary today as it was then.' MTA board member Norman Brown lamented, 'We're turning the clock back.' The pause leaves vulnerable riders—especially low-income New Yorkers—exposed to unreliable, unsafe transit. No new funding is secured. The system’s future hangs in the balance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, pitched as a school safety upgrade, will replace painted bike lanes with a two-way protected lane, add sidewalk extensions, and close two slip lanes. DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals. DOT staffer Alex Ussery said, 'We’ve received some concerns from the community and various elected officials specifically regarding safety around students.' Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.' Installation will begin this summer and finish in the fall. No council member directly sponsored or voted on this DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rally, organized by Riders Alliance, gathered outside Broadway Junction. Protesters held signs reading, 'Don’t cancel @ 11th hour' and 'clean air, fast trains. Fund the MTA.' The matter, titled 'Brooklynites fume over congestion pricing delay: Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' saw Restler declare, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us.' He called for more frequent buses, reliable trains, and less car dependence. Demonstrators warned that the delay defunds the MTA, threatens service for those without cars, and puts Black, Brown, and low-income communities at risk. State Sen. Jabari Brisport urged Hochul to reinstate the plan.

The event, organized by Riders Alliance, followed Governor Kathy Hochul’s last-minute decision to halt the Manhattan toll plan. The protest drew bus and subway riders, who chanted for immediate action and held signs demanding clean air and reliable transit. Restler declared, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' and called for more frequent bus service, better trains, and less dependence on cars and trucks. The demonstrators warned that without congestion pricing, the MTA faces a funding crisis. This threatens repairs and improvements, especially in Black, Brown, and low-income neighborhoods, and risks worsening traffic and delays for emergency services. The protest highlights the systemic danger: when transit funding is gutted, vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure creates a pilot program to install speed cameras near schools, aiming to catch drivers who exceed posted limits. The authorization for the program expires December 31, 2028. Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push. The vote passed with strong support but faced opposition from several members. The bill’s summary reads: "Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2028." No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the measure targets driver speed in zones where children walk, bike, and cross.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Only confusion and risk.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, state leaders adjourned without resolving the MTA’s $1 billion funding gap. The crisis followed Governor Hochul’s abrupt halt of congestion pricing, a move that stripped the MTA of critical capital. The MTA warned, "Modernization and improvement projects like electric buses, accessible stations and new signals will likely need to be deprioritized." State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie both expressed uncertainty. The matter, titled "State of Confusion: Albany Pols Adjourn, Hochul Gets Delusional, MTA Plans Capital Cuts in Wild Final Day," leaves transit upgrades stalled. Stewart-Cousins was mentioned but took no direct action. With no new funding, the MTA’s ability to deliver safer, more reliable service for vulnerable New Yorkers is now in jeopardy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
