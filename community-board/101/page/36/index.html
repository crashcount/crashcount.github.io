A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, part of the 'Great Streets' project, keeps eight car lanes and installs only lightly protected bike lanes with mountable curbs. Samuel Santaella, the author, writes: 'the department has discriminated against thousands of bikers and 13,630 pre-pandemic daily bus riders in order to privilege the needs of 40,000 daily motorists.' Santaella opposes the current DOT plan and urges a redesign: reduce car lanes to four, add center-running bus lanes, fully separated bikeways, and wider sidewalks. He warns that mountable curbs let drivers invade bike lanes, putting cyclists at risk. Bus riders see little benefit, still stuck behind double-parked cars.

The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists. The Council had requested $3.1 billion, but Restler called the $900 million a dramatic investment.

Mayor Adams, in a statement, called his commitment to the program 'steadfast.' The announcement pledges up to $20,000 per site for non-profits to cover costs like barriers and signage. The program, launched during the pandemic, lets residents walk and gather in streets closed to cars. Council action is not specified, but the mayor's office leads. The city promises to focus on underserved neighborhoods, aiming for equity. Still, most operations rely on volunteers, not city workers. Car owners protest the loss of parking. The Horticultural Society of New York will assist with management and upkeep. The city’s support is real but limited. Vulnerable road users get space, but the system leans on unpaid labor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Decades of rising car ownership brought longer, not shorter, trips. Streets stay dangerous. Pollution and risk fall hardest on communities of color. The answer is not more cars. It is safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, released April 20, 2022, reviews a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The report, titled 'Study: Car Ownership Doesn’t Always Cut Black Workers’ Commutes,' finds that despite an increase in car ownership among Black workers—from 76% in 1980 to 85% in 2019—average commute times grew longer, not shorter. The study states, 'it may not be possible to speed up city commutes with automotive strategies alone.' The gap in commute times between Black and White workers persists, especially in large, segregated cities. The article warns that subsidizing driving will make streets more polluted and dangerous, with the heaviest toll on communities of color. It calls for investment in bus rapid transit, trains, and active transportation, and for building communities where jobs and housing are close.

The proposal, part of the council’s response to the mayor’s $98.5 billion preliminary budget, seeks to expand protected bike lanes to 500 miles, bus lanes to 500 miles, and add 38 million feet of pedestrian space. The council’s plan also introduces 40 miles of car-free busways, a benchmark not found in the mayor’s plan or previous legislation.

The E-BIKE Act, once part of the Build Back Better Act, proposed a federal tax credit for e-bike buyers. Congress reduced the credit from $1,500 to $900 and limited eligibility, stalling progress. The article states, 'By replacing car trips, e-bikes can simultaneously lower emissions, improve street safety, and boost riders' health.' John MacArthur, a transportation program manager, notes that local and state lawmakers now lead with rebates and incentives. Council members and legislators in Vermont, Colorado, California, Washington, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have introduced or supported bills for e-bike rebates. Despite the momentum, no current state proposal pairs incentives with new bike infrastructure.
