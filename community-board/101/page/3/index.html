A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.'

Video shows the vehicles touching in a V shape. Investigator Nelson Yu, a retired NYPD detective, confronted the woman, demanding identification and handcuffing her after she failed to produce ID. Yu ordered, 'Get out of the car and show some ID,' and later, 'Get in the car! You're not going anywhere!' The woman was placed in the back seat of Yu’s vehicle. The arrest was later voided. The Attorney General’s office stated, 'OAG is investigating this matter internally and will not have further comment at this time.' The incident highlights the risks of parked vehicles and the escalation that can follow minor collisions, especially when law enforcement is involved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State law blocks quick action. Critics slam the plan as unfair and toothless. Police already target cyclists. Enforcement and real change remain distant. Streets stay risky.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit (2025-06-19) reports that despite Mayor Eric Adams's proposal for a 15 mph speed limit on e-bikes, shops in Manhattan still advertise illegal speed modifications. Adams admits the plan is 'an idea' needing state approval and a lengthy rulemaking process. Critics like Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives call the proposal 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' arguing it unfairly targets cyclists while drivers face lesser consequences for greater harm. Janet Schroeder of the NYC E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the limit will matter without enforcement: 'The 15 mph speed limit does nothing.' The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor infractions.

Riders wait. DOT wants a busway. Some cheer, some worry. Cars may flood side streets. Community Board backs the plan. Debate rages. Pedestrians and transit users stand at the center. Streets hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on June 13, 2025, that the NYC Department of Transportation’s proposal to turn 34th Street into a busway drew mixed reactions at a Community Board 6 meeting. The board voted 31-5 in favor. DOT says the busway could boost bus speeds by 15 percent, helping 28,000 daily riders. Supporters called current buses 'painfully slow' and said, 'Time is life!' Others feared diverted cars would 'flood into narrow residential streets.' The plan would force cars to exit 34th quickly or face tickets. The article highlights the tension between improving transit and the risk of increased traffic on side streets, echoing calls for more data and traffic studies before changes roll out.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
