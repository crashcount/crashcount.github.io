A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, once set to launch June 30, was halted after pressure from U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who feared electoral fallout. The matter, described as a move to 'indefinitely delay' tolls, drew criticism for its timing and impact. Hochul’s action, punctuated by a speech echoing toll critics, left the policy in limbo. Political consultants and union leaders, including @TwuSamuelsen, noted the decision failed to win votes or resolve the issue. The MTA confirmed the program’s pause in court. With no congestion pricing, New York’s streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. The delay means no reduction in car traffic, no new funding for transit, and no safety gains for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk.

Hochul's decision to delay congestion pricing tells subway and bus riders they don't rank.' Advocates like the Tri-State Transportation Campaign called for 'bold, strong leadership.'

The project, once set to connect schools with safe cycling routes, will now feature mostly unprotected lanes and sharrows along 46th Avenue. Only a small segment between Springfield Boulevard and Cloverdale Boulevard will have a protected lane in one direction. DOT cited the need to 'maintain current curbside activities,' meaning parking. Community Board 11 had opposed the original plan, and homeowners rallied with 'NO BIKE LANES' signs and an 800-signature petition. Advocates like Laura Shepard and Elizabeth Adams condemned the rollback, saying, 'We can't let politics get in the way of saving lives.' Ben Turner criticized the prioritization of parking over safety, noting most homes already have driveways.

The project, led by the NJ Turnpike Authority, faces criticism for ignoring alternatives like mass transit, greenways, and bikeways. The article states: 'Gov. Phil Murphy wants to spend over $10 billion to widen a highway in an environmental justice community while asking transit riders to shoulder a 15 percent fare hike. That is unjust and unacceptable.' The Turnpike Authority held limited public sessions, excluded on-the-record comments, and failed to address induced demand or environmental justice. The piece urges federal agencies to reject the project, arguing it will worsen pollution, noise, and health outcomes for vulnerable residents. The author calls for investment in safer, more sustainable transportation instead.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, revealed by DOT Director Ted Wright, creates a 'bike boulevard' with two-way protected bike lanes from Steinway Street to Vernon Boulevard. The plan shifts the avenue to one-way car traffic, adds painted pedestrian islands, curb extensions, and may include a car-free plaza. DOT aims to reduce vehicle presence and traffic violence, responding to local advocacy after several high-profile crashes. Residents and organizers, including Alana Herlands and John Surico, voiced strong support: 'We are going to advocate for the most ambitious plan that not only adds more space for the community... but also reduces traffic violence.' Implementation is set for summer and fall, with an extension east to 51st Street planned next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
