A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He says communities need more input. Advocates warn this lets small groups block life-saving changes. The city falls behind on safety targets. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On October 17, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams made a public statement criticizing the Department of Transportation’s community outreach for street redesigns. No council bill number applies; this is a mayoral policy stance. Adams said, “We have not done a good job of speaking to long-term residents on how they want the shaping of their streets to change.” He announced a new door-to-door engagement strategy on Underhill Avenue, after stalling a bike network project for over a year. Adams’s comments came as he defended delays and rollbacks of approved street safety improvements, citing the need for more community input. Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Juan Restrepo (Transportation Alternatives) condemned the mayor’s approach, warning it gives veto power to small groups and leaves the city “rudderless” on street safety. DOT outreach has dropped to its lowest since Vision Zero began. The city is on pace to miss its bike and bus lane goals for the second year running. Vulnerable road users face continued danger as life-saving projects stall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) leads the rollout. The plan covers about 41% of city housing. The official summary states, 'New Yorkers living in smaller residential buildings will have to set out their garbage in lidded bins.' DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended sidewalk placement, saying, 'It is standard practice around the world to put wheelie bins out on the sidewalk rather than in the parking lane.' Advocate Christine Berthet countered, 'While the bags will be easy to move between cars, containers will be much harder. And therefore having them in the parking lane would be a major benefit.' The city will retrofit trucks for the new bins. For now, pedestrians must still navigate bins on crowded sidewalks. The curb stays reserved for parked cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, unveiled by DSNY, aims to move trash from sidewalks into closed bins, targeting cleaner streets and less sidewalk clutter. The mayor said, 'Everyday New Yorkers are tired of the rodents, they’re tired of the trash, and this is a small price to pay on ensuring that you can have cleaner streets.' Council member Shaun Abreu, representing West Harlem, voiced strong support, citing visible improvements from the local pilot. The plan requires smaller buildings to use wheeled bins on sidewalks, while larger buildings would get shared curbside containers. The city faces pushback from some residents, but Adams insists street cleanliness is a top concern. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the move could clear sidewalks for pedestrians and reduce hazards from trash piles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in October 2023, has not specified a streamlined process for licensing. The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy.

No council bill or vote was involved. No council member stepped forward. The city’s emergency response faltered. Vulnerable road users—those on foot, on transit, in cars—bore the brunt.

The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers. Assembly Member Grace Lee said, 'They should be exempt from tolls under the congestion pricing plan.' The MTA has not taken a position on the exemption.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He calls for federal funds to turn the highway into a bike and pedestrian haven. The plan faces legal and political hurdles but aims to reclaim space for people.</p><p class=mb3>On September 20, 2023, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine revived a proposal to remove the FDR Drive viaduct south of the Brooklyn Bridge. The plan, not yet in committee or assigned a bill number, seeks federal support through the Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods grant. Levine urges Mayor Adams to apply for funding, stating, 'We’re a perfect candidate for Reconnecting Communities.' State Senator Brian Kavanagh voiced support, saying, 'We will work with the borough president.' The proposal would transform the underused highway into a waterfront space for cyclists and pedestrians, echoing successful removals in cities like Seattle and Seoul. The project faces major legal, environmental, and jurisdictional obstacles, as the FDR is state-owned and exempt from congestion pricing. The city previously considered this removal for coastal resiliency, but dropped it from the final plan. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the plan centers vulnerable road users by reclaiming space from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
