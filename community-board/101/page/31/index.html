A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The agency completed only 25 miles of bike lanes and 11.95 miles of bus lanes. The matter, titled 'DOT Will Not Reach Required Bike and Bus Lane Requirements This Year,' drew sharp criticism from Riders Alliance and Transportation Alternatives. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said, 'The Adams administration is many miles wide of the mark when it comes to complying with the Streets Plan and keeping the mayor's promise to millions of riders.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives added, 'The city needs to meet these goals without delay or excuse and stop leaving New Yorkers who walk, bike, and bus behind.' A City Council spokesperson blamed staff shortages and unfilled vacancies, calling the situation 'unacceptable.' The Council urged the administration to fill key roles and meet legal requirements. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—bear the brunt of these failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The commentary notes, 'the stats on 2021's pedestrian death crisis came out not too long ago, and they were awful. As in, the-worst-they-been-in-40-years awful.' No council bill or vote is attached, but the piece draws on federal data and expert analysis. It singles out SUVs as a main threat: drivers are four times more likely to strike pedestrians while turning, and children hit by SUVs are eight times more likely to die than if struck by smaller cars. The article also exposes the frequency and devastation of vehicle-into-building crashes and the false promise of autonomous vehicles. It underscores how car culture’s burdens fall hardest on marginalized communities. The message is clear: systemic danger persists, and the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA Board approved a 2023 budget allowing fare hikes and service changes, pending Albany’s action. Chairman Janno Lieber said, "All good things can happen if people are willing to pay for them, or help figure out recurring funding sources, which is what MTA needs to achieve fiscal stability." New York City Transit President Richard Davey explained that peak hour service would be trimmed, with modest increases in wait times, while some weekend service would expand. Transit advocates and union leaders, including Richard Davis, condemned the cuts, warning of increased rider frustration and assaults on workers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani urged passage of bills to freeze fares and fill the MTA’s fiscal gap, stating, "We have to fix the rot at the heart of the transit system." No formal safety analyst assessment was provided, but the debate centers on the risk to riders and workers if service shrinks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Under the 1975 18-b law, the state must match local funding for public transit. Instead, since 1995, Albany has counted regional transit taxes as its own share, leaving a $4.9 billion shortfall. State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli criticizes the practice: 'the state has used a portion of these resources... rather than using General Fund revenues as originally intended.' Assembly Member Amy Paulin, chair of the Corporations Committee, insists, 'we don’t have to justify funding the MTA adequately. It is very justified.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls for an end to 'raiding dedicated funds.' The governor’s office has not pledged to stop.

They warn against using cameras as cash cows or funding police and private contractors. The report states: "The purpose of [automated enforcement] is to improve safety, not catch unsuspecting drivers." Ralph adds, "They need to be in places with known safety risks, and it should be a data driven process." The analysis calls for shifting control to transportation departments and removing jail time for unpaid fines. These changes aim to protect vulnerable road users and make streets safer for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cameras miss them. Streets stay dangerous. Senator Gounardes pushes a bill to pay citizens for reporting illegal plates. Police claim action, but advocates see little change. The bill sits in committee. Ghost cars keep rolling.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill in 2022 to reward citizens who report illegal license plates. The bill remains in committee. The measure would give whistleblowers 25% of the ticket, up to $75. The matter targets drivers who obscure or remove plates to dodge automated enforcement. As city and state agencies rely more on cameras to catch speeders and red-light runners, more drivers hide their plates. The Department of Transportation says cameras failed to ticket over 4% of violators last fall, up from 1% in 2019. Advocates accuse police of lax enforcement and even breaking the law themselves. Gounardes’s bill, still stalled, aims to close this loophole and put power in the hands of citizens. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while enforcement lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, "Designing New York: Streetscapes for Wellness," urges a shift from car-centric planning to public spaces that serve people. The statement notes, "streets are arguably one of the city’s most readily accessed and underutilized public resources." The Commission, in collaboration with city agencies and advocacy groups, showcases case studies where open streets and community-driven design improved health and access. The report criticizes decades of planning that prioritized cars and blocked communities from vital spaces. It calls for equity, local engagement, and innovation in street design. No council member is named; this is a commission-led initiative.

DOT spokesman Vin Barone insists the agency intends to meet 2023 goals, but specifics are lacking. The law has no enforcement provision.

They warn of a 'death spiral' if service cuts and fare hikes hit. Hochul’s support for projects like the Interborough Express and congestion pricing is noted. The message is clear: New Yorkers demand safe, reliable transit, and the governor must deliver.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Three pedestrians have died since 2016.</p><p class=mb3>On November 21, 2022, the Department of Transportation unveiled a plan for a parking-protected bike lane on nearly 40 blocks of 10th Avenue, stretching from W. 14th to W. 52nd streets. Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched. Council Member Erik Bottcher and local activists pushed for the redesign, citing high crash and fatality rates: 173 crashes this year, 40 injuries, and three pedestrian deaths since 2016. Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits. The agency aims to start work in spring and finish by fall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They dodge car chaos, breathe clean air, and stay close. Their story cuts through car culture. They prove families can thrive without a car. Streets shape safety. Bikes bring freedom.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2022, Streetsblog NYC published a public advocacy piece titled "Cargo Bikes: The Happiest Transportation Mode on Earth." The article highlights the Boelens family, who have lived car-free for 11 years, using cargo bikes for daily errands and childcare. The piece states: "We find it's just as easy to get around within a five-mile radius by bike than it is by car. We get exercise, fresh air, and save so much money." The story features direct quotes from Arnout and Nicole Zoeller Boelens, who describe the ease and joy of cycling as a family. No council bill, vote, or committee action is involved. The article challenges the myth that families need cars, showing how street design—not personal choice—shapes safety and mobility for vulnerable road users. No formal safety analyst assessment is included.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
