A car does not stop. The numbers pile up. <strong>In the last twelve months, 243 people were injured in traffic crashes in Manhattan CB1. Six were seriously hurt. One did not survive.</strong> The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left with severe head wounds after a crash at Canal and Lafayette. A sedan struck an 88-year-old man crossing Centre Street. He bled from the head. He survived, but the street did not forgive. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed one, seriously injured three, and left 150 more with lesser wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt ten. Bikes injured twenty-four. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not shared equally. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the distracted. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>. These are good steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported West Side Spirit</a>. The city investigates. The family grieves. The crosswalk stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h2><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Every delay is a risk. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The council can act. The mayor can act. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer speeds. Demand protected crossings. Demand action.</strong> The next victim is only a step away.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report, "Designing New York: Streetscapes for Wellness," urges a shift from car-centric planning to public spaces that serve people. The statement notes, "streets are arguably one of the city’s most readily accessed and underutilized public resources." The Commission, in collaboration with city agencies and advocacy groups, showcases case studies where open streets and community-driven design improved health and access. The report criticizes decades of planning that prioritized cars and blocked communities from vital spaces. It calls for equity, local engagement, and innovation in street design. No council member is named; this is a commission-led initiative. The statement supports reallocating street space and opposes car-first planning, pushing for a city where wellness and safety come first.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, coordinated with Council Member Julie Menin, used fiber-reinforced polymer panels to shield riders from the bridge’s hazardous metal grating. The official matter: 'Roosevelt Island Bridge bike lane now covered for a safer, smoother ride.' Won praised the project’s quick finish and its promise of safer, more comfortable biking. DOT and community leaders noted the new surface prevents slips and flats, separating cyclists from traffic. The $100,000 upgrade, never before used in New York, aims to keep vulnerable road users out of harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

As of December 2022, DOT had built only 7.7 miles, with 4.2 miles of new camera-enforced lanes and 7.3 miles under construction. The agency cites staff shortages and budget cuts as the main obstacles. Council members and advocates, including Riders Alliance and the City Council, have condemned the delays and called staff shortages 'unacceptable.' Mayor Adams’s administration has revised its promise, now counting 'enhanced' lanes, not just new ones. DOT spokesman Vin Barone insists the agency intends to meet 2023 goals, but specifics are lacking. The law has no enforcement provision. The city’s one million daily bus riders, many low-income and people of color, continue to suffer slow, unreliable service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Alfresco NYC Coalition and advocates like Maulin Mehta support shifting oversight to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a broader, safer approach to curb use.

Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched.

Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits.

The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.'

The plan was presented to Manhattan Community Board 12's Traffic and Transportation committee, which gave unanimous advisory support. The DOT aims to install the changes by summer or early fall 2023. The proposal states: 'The city wants to repurpose a pair of car lanes on the Washington Bridge uptown for a two-way bike lane and a bus lane next year, giving a dedicated space to cyclists who are currently forced to share extremely narrow paths with pedestrians.' Lucia Deng, a Transportation Alternatives activist, called the move 'huge,' noting the Bronx and Upper Manhattan have long been neglected. DOT planner Patrick Kennedy said, 'We try to maintain the protected connections as much as possible. They really only work if they’re continuous.'

The study, led by University of Washington researchers, argues that 'rolling back the clocks in November may give millions of Americans an extra hour of sleep, but it also costs human and animal lives on U.S. roads that could be saved by making daylight savings time permanent.' The report found that keeping daylight savings time year-round could prevent 33 human deaths and 36,550 deer deaths annually by reducing crashes during dark hours, especially at peak commute times. A 2004 Rutgers study cited in the report found permanent daylight savings time would cut pedestrian deaths by about 13 percent during dusk and dawn. The researchers stress that systemic changes—like mandatory streetlights, traffic-calming infrastructure, and wildlife crossings—are also needed to protect vulnerable road users and wildlife.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
