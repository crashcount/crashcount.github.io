The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to department of transportation approval prior to issuing or renewing a stoop line stand license.' Ung's bill would force the Department of Transportation to sign off before any stoop line stand gets a license or renewal. DOT must check for sidewalk blockages, consider pedestrian volume, and conduct site visits if a stand sits near a narrowing structure. If a stand is too wide and blocks the way, DOT can shrink it to four feet. The law puts the burden on businesses, not walkers. It aims to keep sidewalks open for people, not cluttered by commerce.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street is notorious for crashes. Advocates blame curb cuts and poor design. Officials call Chen’s death preventable. The city promises fixes, but families keep mourning children.</p><p class=mb3>On November 30, 2023, a hit-and-run driver killed 3-year-old Quintas Chen in downtown Flushing, Queens. The driver pulled out of a parking lot, struck Chen, and fled. Police later arrested a 20-year-old suspect for leaving the scene and driving without a license. Assembly Member Ron Kim, who walks the block daily, called out the area’s longstanding dangers: 'We've always recognized there was a problem on this block.' The street, College Point Boulevard, has seen 276 crashes since 2019. Advocates, including Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives, called Chen’s death preventable and demanded citywide safe street improvements. Harris said, 'We know how to make our streets safe, especially for our youngest and most vulnerable New Yorkers.' Mayor Adams pledged to daylight and redesign 1,000 intersections each year, but advocates argue this is not enough. The tragedy highlights the deadly risk curb cuts and poor street design pose to children and families.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill passed both the state Senate and Assembly unanimously. The matter summary called for a study to extend the greenway, which runs parallel to the hazardous Union Turnpike. State Senator John Liu sponsored the bill and vowed to keep pushing for the project, saying, 'I’m confident we’ll get there.' Hochul’s veto cited budget concerns and the risk of 'duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy.' Advocates like Joby Jacob called the veto a blow to years of organizing, noting that people are forced to walk dirt paths where sidewalks should be.

Adams made them permanent, but cut enforcement hours. Illegal parking still chokes lanes. Riders wait. Drivers fume. Cameras catch some, but not all. Streets stay dangerous. The city drags its feet.</p><p class=mb3>This report examines four busways implemented in 2020 and 2021 during Mayor de Blasio’s final years. The projects—Jay Street, West 181st Street, Flushing Main Street, and Archer/Jamaica avenues—were made permanent by Mayor Adams, though enforcement hours were reduced on most. The article notes: “Four busways announced and implemented in 2020 and 2021 during the latter days of the de Blasio administration appear to have sped up service for transit riders, according to official MTA bus speed data.” Bus operators like Orlando Tejeda and Anita Mealy describe persistent illegal parking and double-parking, which slows buses and endangers riders. Despite camera enforcement, violations remain rampant. Council Member Peter Koo opposed the Flushing busway, but it survived legal and political attacks. Riders and drivers report faster trips, but the city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users at risk. The city’s promise of safer, faster streets is only half-kept.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled "City Traffic Helps Make Bus Service Unbearable, Expensive And Difficult To Improve," highlights how traffic congestion, double-parking, and outdated routes cripple bus efficiency. State Sen. John Liu urges more service in neighborhoods where buses can move. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says, "With better service, the path to more service is a much clearer one." ABLE cameras have improved bus speeds by 5 percent on enforced routes. Despite promises, Mayor Eric Adams has not delivered on expanding bus lanes. The MTA and advocates call for more funding and better service. Riders remain stuck, exposed to traffic danger, while systemic failures persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
