One was a 78-year-old woman, struck and left to die on Northern Boulevard. The driver did not stop. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo;</a> Another day, a man and a child were hit at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man was pinned under the car. The child was sent to the hospital. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>&ldquo;Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, 1,029 people have been hurt here.

In three years, cars and SUVs killed 10, seriously injured 26, and left 154 with moderate wounds. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes and mopeds, almost none. The street is not a fair fight.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, New York can set its own speed limits. But the limit is not yet 20 mph. The law sits. The streets wait. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them on. Each year, the clock runs down.</p><p>No local official has spoken out in these latest deaths. No new redesigns have come for the worst crossings. The silence is heavy. The blood dries, but the danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Every delay is another family broken.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets built for people, not for speed.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the operation of electric scooters and bicycles with electric assist in parks,' sought to ban e-scooters and e-bikes from all parks under city jurisdiction. Council Members Robert F. Holden (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The summary reads: 'This bill would prohibit the operation of electric scooters and bicycles with electric assist in any park under the jurisdiction of the department of parks and recreation.' No safety analyst assessed the bill’s impact on vulnerable road users. The measure targeted micro-mobility, not the cars that kill.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT must approve every site. If a stand narrows a busy path, inspectors must visit. Stands wider than four feet get cut down. Pedestrian flow comes first.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1272-2023, introduced by Council Member Sandra Ung and filed at session's end, landed in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on December 6, 2023. The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to department of transportation approval prior to issuing or renewing a stoop line stand license.' Ung's bill would force the Department of Transportation to sign off before any stoop line stand gets a license or renewal. DOT must check for sidewalk blockages, consider pedestrian volume, and conduct site visits if a stand sits near a narrowing structure. If a stand is too wide and blocks the way, DOT can shrink it to four feet. The law puts the burden on businesses, not walkers. It aims to keep sidewalks open for people, not cluttered by commerce.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver pulled out of a parking lot, struck Chen, and fled. Police later arrested a 20-year-old suspect for leaving the scene and driving without a license. Assembly Member Ron Kim, who walks the block daily, called out the area’s longstanding dangers: 'We've always recognized there was a problem on this block.' The street, College Point Boulevard, has seen 276 crashes since 2019. Advocates, including Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives, called Chen’s death preventable and demanded citywide safe street improvements. Harris said, 'We know how to make our streets safe, especially for our youngest and most vulnerable New Yorkers.' Mayor Adams pledged to daylight and redesign 1,000 intersections each year, but advocates argue this is not enough. The tragedy highlights the deadly risk curb cuts and poor street design pose to children and families.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill passed both the state Senate and Assembly unanimously. The matter summary called for a study to extend the greenway, which runs parallel to the hazardous Union Turnpike. State Senator John Liu sponsored the bill and vowed to keep pushing for the project, saying, 'I’m confident we’ll get there.' Hochul’s veto cited budget concerns and the risk of 'duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy.' Advocates like Joby Jacob called the veto a blow to years of organizing, noting that people are forced to walk dirt paths where sidewalks should be.

Riders wait. Buses crawl. Costs soar. Lawmakers push for more service, but congestion and double-parked cars stall progress. ABLE cameras help, but Mayor Adams drags feet on bus lanes. Riders pay the price. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published November 14, 2023, details the ongoing crisis in New York City bus service. The article, titled "City Traffic Helps Make Bus Service Unbearable, Expensive And Difficult To Improve," highlights how traffic congestion, double-parking, and outdated routes cripple bus efficiency. State Sen. John Liu urges more service in neighborhoods where buses can move. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says, "With better service, the path to more service is a much clearer one." ABLE cameras have improved bus speeds by 5 percent on enforced routes. Despite promises, Mayor Eric Adams has not delivered on expanding bus lanes. The MTA and advocates call for more funding and better service. Riders remain stuck, exposed to traffic danger, while systemic failures persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
