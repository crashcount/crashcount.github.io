Since 2022, 23 people have died and 3,236 have been injured in crashes here. Eighty-five suffered injuries so severe they will never be the same. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, children, elders—the man who never made it home, the woman left broken at the curb.</p><p>Last month, a bus jumped the curb at 57th Road and Main Street. Seven people were hurt. A passenger, clutching her child, said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.&rdquo;</a> The bus driver, just 25, told police he misjudged the curb. Later, video showed he may have fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation drags on. Another rider said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo;</a> as the pole stood bent and the sidewalk scarred.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. In the last twelve months, three people died and 1,111 were hurt in crashes here. Children, elders, and those on foot or bike are most likely to pay with their bodies. Cars and SUVs are the main killers, responsible for most deaths and injuries. The violence is steady. It does not stop for rain, sun, or the school bell.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Some steps forward, too many sideways. Council Member Sandra Ung has co-sponsored bills for speed humps, raised crosswalks, and better lighting. She backed a study on safer street design. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a move proven to protect the vulnerable—she was absent. Council Member Vickie Paladino voted no. She did, however, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>celebrate new car-free school streets</a>, calling them a win for children’s safety.</p><p>Senator John Liu voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill that would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, another family is shattered. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for those who walk and ride. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, the incident occurred near dusk as the man was 'working in the roadway' and 'stood upright.' The Infiniti, operated by a licensed male driver, moved in reverse and collided with the stationary SUV. The report lists 'Backing Unsafely' as the contributing factor, directly implicating the driver’s maneuver. The impact forced the SUV’s bumper against the man’s knee and lower leg, causing crush injuries. The police narrative notes the victim did not fall and remained conscious at the scene. No victim behavior is cited as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the danger posed by driver errors, especially unsafe reversing, to people working or standing in the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The effort, led by the NYPD and Department of Transportation, aims to keep inebriated motorists off the roads. Senator John Liu, representing District 16, publicly supported the crackdown and advocated for lowering the legal blood alcohol limit from .08 to .05. The campaign includes increased police patrols and active speed cameras. The official matter summary states: 'Drunk driving crackdown: NYC launches aggressive enforcement campaign for New Year’s weekend.' Liu said, 'Cracking down on drunk driving, which continues to destroy lives and families, is the right focus as New Year's approaches.' The DOT notes fatalities from drunk driving have risen nearly 30% in recent years.
