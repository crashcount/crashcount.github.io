The report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor, underscoring a critical driver error that led to the crash. The narrative states, 'The cause: failure to yield. The wound: the frame.' No evidence in the report suggests any victim behavior contributed to the crash.
