Since 2022, at least <strong>23 people died</strong> on its streets and highways; drivers injured thousands more. Pedestrians took the worst of it: <strong>10 pedestrians dead</strong>; cyclists, <strong>3 dead</strong>. SUVs and sedans did most of the harm.</p><h3 id=where-people-die>Where people die</h3><p>Main Street at Reeves Avenue: a <strong>68‑year‑old woman</strong> crossing outside an intersection was struck and killed by a northbound Toyota. The database lists the factor as <strong>“Unsafe Speed.”</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Bowne Street at 41st Avenue, a <strong>63‑year‑old cyclist</strong> was hit and killed by a left‑turning Ford SUV. The listed factor: <strong>Driver Inattention/Distraction</strong>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</p><p>College Point Boulevard at Blossom Avenue: a <strong>63‑year‑old moped rider</strong> died after a Honda SUV made a left turn. The database says <strong>Failure to Yield</strong>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</p><p>Highways cut through this district and take their toll. The <strong>Cross Island Parkway</strong> leads CB7’s hotspot list for injuries and deaths; the <strong>Whitestone Expressway</strong> is next. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top locations</a>.</p><h3 id=when-the-pain-hits>When the pain hits</h3><p>The danger does not sleep. From 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., deaths stack up: 17:00 (<strong>1 death</strong>), 18:00 (<strong>1</strong>), 19:00 (<strong>3</strong>), 20:00 (<strong>2</strong>), 21:00 (<strong>4</strong>). <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly pattern</a>. Morning brings its share too: 9 a.m. (<strong>2 deaths</strong>), 10 a.m. (<strong>1</strong>), 14:00 (<strong>1</strong>), 15:00 (<strong>1</strong>), 16:00 (<strong>1</strong>). This is not one bad corner. It is the whole day tearing flesh.</p><h3 id=whats-driving-the-harm>What’s driving the harm</h3><p>The data points to drivers. CB7’s leading listed factor is “other,” but named factors tell the story: <strong>Failure to Yield</strong> killed and injured, “inattention/distraction” injured scores, alcohol appears too. <strong>Unsafe speed</strong> shows up in a pedestrian death on Main Street. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>factor rollup</a>.</p><p>Who gets hit: pedestrians and cyclists. Since 2022, pedestrians suffered <strong>807 injuries</strong> and <strong>33 serious injuries</strong>; cyclists had <strong>244 injuries</strong> and <strong>7 serious injuries</strong>.

The council file says, “This bill would remove the bus lane and bike lane quotas from the Streets Master Plan.” Status: in committee. No vote yet.</p><h3 id=state-move-against-repeat-speeders>State move against repeat speeders</h3><p>Albany moved on people who won’t slow down. The Senate bill <strong>S 4045</strong> advanced in June. Senators including <strong>John Liu</strong> and <strong>Toby Stavisky</strong> voted yes in committee; Liu also co‑sponsored. The bill would require speed limiters after repeated violations. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bill page</a>.</p><h3 id=local-fixes-that-do-not-need-a-new-law>Local fixes that do not need a new law</h3><p>Daylight every corner on <strong>Main Street</strong> and <strong>College Point Boulevard</strong>. Harden the left turns that killed a cyclist on 41st Avenue and a moped rider at Blossom Avenue. Add LPIs and leading ped phases at the crash corners. Put concrete where speeding begins on <strong>Northern Boulevard</strong>. Target the evening peak on Whitestone and Cross Island with speed control. The data tells you when and where. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-ledger>The ledger</h3><p>In the last 12 months, CB7 recorded <strong>3 deaths</strong>, <strong>1,348 injuries</strong>, and <strong>38 serious injuries</strong>. Year‑to‑date injuries are up, with crashes rising about 45% over last year to date. The bodies skew old: two of this year’s dead were <strong>75+</strong>; one was <strong>45‑54</strong>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a>.</p><h3 id=what-must-change-citywide>What must change citywide</h3><p>Slower streets save lives.
