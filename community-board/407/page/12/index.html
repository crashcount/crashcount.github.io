The incident occurred at 8:51 a.m. The report states the van’s brakes were defective, causing it to move unexpectedly and strike the man. The narrative describes the van as having 'failed brakes' and details how it 'crushed a 26-year-old man’s legs.' The victim remained conscious on the pavement, bleeding. Two parked vehicles—a van and an SUV—were involved, but only the van moved. The police report lists 'Brakes Defective' as the primary contributing factor. No driver errors beyond mechanical failure are cited. The report does not attribute any contributing actions to the pedestrian.

The city adds more car-free zones for kids. Streets once deadly will now be safer for walking, play, and learning. The move targets neighborhoods hit hardest by crashes.</p><p class=mb3>On August 29, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a record 71 school streets will close to cars this fall. The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
