A motorcycle traveling south struck the left rear bumper of an eastbound SUV that was making a left turn. The motorcycle driver was unlicensed, and driver inexperience was listed as a contributing factor. The SUV carried a 5-year-old female passenger in a child restraint in the middle rear seat, who sustained a head injury and whiplash but was conscious and not ejected.
