Council Member Sandra Ung leads as primary sponsor, joined by Bottcher, Lee, Brannan, Brewer, Vernikov, Zhuang, Gennaro, Won, Louis, Restler, and the Manhattan Borough President. The bill would raise fines for both light and heavy vehicles. It was referred to committee on the day of introduction. No vote has been held.

Metal and flesh bore the cost of mechanical neglect.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 2022 Toyota SUV was parked on 158th Street in Queens when it began rolling west due to defective brakes. The report states, 'A parked 2022 Toyota SUV rolled west with failed brakes. It struck, crumpling its front.' Inside the vehicle, a 78-year-old man, belted in and alone, suffered crush injuries to his entire body but remained conscious. The police report explicitly cites 'Brakes Defective' as the contributing factor in the crash. The vehicle did not stop until after the collision, and the impact left the driver injured. No other contributing factors related to the victim’s behavior are listed in the report. The incident underscores the lethal risk posed by mechanical failure in vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
