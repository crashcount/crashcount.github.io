One was a 78-year-old woman, struck and left to die on Northern Boulevard. The driver did not stop. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo;</a> Another day, a man and a child were hit at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man was pinned under the car. The child was sent to the hospital. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>&ldquo;Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, 1,029 people have been hurt here. Thirty-four were seriously injured. Most were walking, biking, or just trying to get home. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In three years, cars and SUVs killed 10, seriously injured 26, and left 154 with moderate wounds. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes and mopeds, almost none. The street is not a fair fight.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, New York can set its own speed limits. But the limit is not yet 20 mph. The law sits. The streets wait. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them on. Each year, the clock runs down.</p><p>No local official has spoken out in these latest deaths. No new redesigns have come for the worst crossings. The silence is heavy. The blood dries, but the danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Every delay is another family broken.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets built for people, not for speed.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A 2015 Nissan sedan, traveling south and making a left turn, struck a 79-year-old male pedestrian at the intersection. The point of impact was the vehicle’s left front quarter panel, which sustained damage. The pedestrian was conscious but suffered a fracture and dislocation to his knee, lower leg, and foot. The police report explicitly cites the driver’s failure to yield right-of-way as a contributing factor. The pedestrian’s actions were not listed as contributing factors. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle with two occupants inside. This collision underscores the dangers posed by driver errors at intersections, especially failure to yield to pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The car’s bumper stayed clean. His head did not. He remained conscious as the car kept moving, leaving him with severe crush injuries.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 2007 Honda sedan reversed on Station Road near 162nd Street in Queens, striking a 59-year-old man who was crossing without a signal. The report states, 'A 2007 Honda backed into him. The bumper was clean. His head was not. He stayed conscious. The car kept moving. He was crushed.' The pedestrian suffered head and crush injuries but remained conscious at the scene. The vehicle showed no damage, according to the report. The driver’s actions—backing without apparent awareness of a person behind—created a lethal hazard for the man on foot. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the narrative centers the impact and ongoing movement of the sedan as the source of harm. The pedestrian’s crossing without a signal is noted only after the vehicle’s actions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
