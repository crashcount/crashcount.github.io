The Mercedes, driven by FDNY firefighter Michael Pena, T-boned Diaz’s car. Surveillance footage showed Diaz entering the intersection as the pedestrian signal allowed crossing. Pena was arrested at the scene and charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusing a breath test. The FDNY suspended Pena without pay. Two Mercedes passengers were hospitalized.

According to the police report, the sedan was 'making left turn' when it struck the cyclist, who was 'going straight ahead.' The report states, 'Steel met skin. The rider, 32, fell hard. Legs crushed.' The cyclist suffered crush injuries to the lower legs and remained conscious at the scene. Police explicitly list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both the sedan and the crash overall. The sedan’s left front bumper struck the bike’s center front end. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after driver distraction is cited as the cause. The crash underscores the persistent risk posed by inattentive drivers to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

He sustained crush injuries to his entire body but remained conscious at the scene. The report notes 'alcohol involvement' as a contributing factor in the crash. No other individuals were injured, as all struck vehicles were unoccupied and parked. The narrative describes the sedan slamming into the stationary SUVs, with metal folding and lights blinking in the aftermath. The data highlights the presence of alcohol in the driver's system, a critical factor in the violent impact. No victim behavior is cited as contributing to the crash.
