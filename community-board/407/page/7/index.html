Thirty-four were seriously injured. Most were walking, biking, or just trying to get home. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In three years, cars and SUVs killed 10, seriously injured 26, and left 154 with moderate wounds. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes and mopeds, almost none. The street is not a fair fight.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, New York can set its own speed limits. But the limit is not yet 20 mph. The law sits. The streets wait. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them on. Each year, the clock runs down.</p><p>No local official has spoken out in these latest deaths. No new redesigns have come for the worst crossings. The silence is heavy. The blood dries, but the danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Every delay is another family broken.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets built for people, not for speed.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law in relation to requiring a study and plan regarding the installation of tactile paving on sidewalks,' mandates a one-year study and a five-year plan for tactile paving across New York City. Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Chris Banks, and Sandra Ung back the measure. The Department of Transportation must identify high-priority blocks, consult disability advocates, and review best practices. The Commissioner must submit a plan and annual progress reports to the Mayor and Council Speaker, all posted online. The bill aims to set design standards, clarify maintenance and liability, and ensure public outreach. The legislation focuses on making sidewalks safer and more accessible for people with vision loss.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff.

The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily.

The vehicle was traveling west and making a left turn when the collision occurred at the right front bumper.

The pedestrian was crossing with the signal, eliminating her actions as a contributing factor. She sustained abrasions and injuries to her entire body but remained conscious after the crash. The SUV showed no damage, indicating a low-speed impact. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally, but his failure to yield created a hazardous situation resulting in serious injury to the pedestrian.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states: 'the number of children and teens killed in car crashes in NYC has reached record highs, with 16 kids killed last year.' This is the highest three-year total since Vision Zero began in 2014. Councilmember Vickie Paladino (District 19, Queens) is mentioned as a staunch opponent of Vision Zero, speed cameras, and bike lanes. The report criticizes elected leaders for inaction and calls for urgent safety measures, including speed governors for repeat offenders, universal daylighting, lower speed limits, more protected bike lanes, and stronger regulation of delivery apps. The Department of Transportation supports some measures but opposes universal daylighting. The report highlights that most pedestrians killed at intersections were at crossings without physical daylighting, and most cyclists killed were on streets without protected bike lanes. Vulnerable road users remain exposed as city leaders delay life-saving changes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
