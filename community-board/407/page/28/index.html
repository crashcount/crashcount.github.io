Holden with co-sponsors including Ariola, Riley, Yeger, Restler, Brooks-Powers, Hanks, Borelli, Carr, Kagan, Vernikov, and Paladino. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects. While it aims to protect emergency access, advocates warn it could delay or block street redesigns that save lives for people walking and biking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by 21 co-sponsors including Williams, Hanif, and Yeger. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided, but the measure aimed to end secrecy around life-saving street changes.
