Thirty-four were seriously injured. Most were walking, biking, or just trying to get home. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In three years, cars and SUVs killed 10, seriously injured 26, and left 154 with moderate wounds. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes and mopeds, almost none. The street is not a fair fight.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, New York can set its own speed limits. But the limit is not yet 20 mph. The law sits. The streets wait. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them on. Each year, the clock runs down.</p><p>No local official has spoken out in these latest deaths. No new redesigns have come for the worst crossings. The silence is heavy. The blood dries, but the danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Every delay is another family broken.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets built for people, not for speed.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects.

The bill required the Department of Transportation to post details of all traffic control device and speed reducer requests on a public website. The matter summary reads: 'The required website would include, but need not be limited to, the following information: case number, general topic, issue, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial of traffic control device, and if approved, the timeline for completion.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by 21 co-sponsors including Williams, Hanif, and Yeger. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided, but the measure aimed to end secrecy around life-saving street changes.
