Since 2022, drivers killed at least <strong>16 people</strong> here and injured thousands, most of them car occupants, many on foot or bike, according to city crash data. Ten were pedestrians. Three rode bikes. The harm clusters on <strong>Whitestone Expressway</strong> and the <strong>Cross Island Parkway</strong>.</p><h3 id=where-people-die>Where people die</h3><p>A 68-year-old woman walking on Main Street near Reeves Avenue was hit by a northbound sedan at unsafe speed and died at the scene, the city’s database shows. The form is blunt: “Unsafe Speed.” The driver kept going straight. The woman did not go home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a> lists no crosswalk; it lists death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Source</a> (CrashID 4702952).</p><p>At Bowne Street and 41st Avenue, a 63-year-old cyclist was struck and killed by a left-turning SUV. The record says the SUV driver was inattentive. It also says “Ejected.” The bike kept going west. The person did not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Database record</a> shows a death and a turn across the rider’s path. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Source</a> (CrashID 4731666).</p><p>On College Point Boulevard at Blossom Avenue, a moped rider, 63, was killed in a left-turn crash with an SUV. The fields are cold: “Apparent Death.” “Severe Bleeding.” Another left turn. Another woman gone. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Record</a> here. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Source</a> (CrashID 4707767).</p><h3 id=hot-roads-hard-hours>Hot roads, hard hours</h3><p>The worst corridors keep showing up: <strong>Whitestone Expressway</strong> (2 deaths, 278 injuries) and the <strong>Cross Island Parkway</strong> (1 death, 175 injuries). These are not small numbers. They are a drumbeat. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Top locations</a> name them both.</p><p>Nights are not spared. Deaths spike after dark, with the heaviest counts around 7 to 10 p.m., then again at 8 and 9 p.m., and into the 21:00 hour. People are still out. So are the cars. The sheet shows the hour, the injuries, the dead. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly distribution</a>.</p><p>The causes cut a pattern: “other” leads the tally with 15 deaths; “failure to yield” is named in one death and 82 injuries; “vulnerable road user error” appears in four deaths but does not absolve drivers with steel and speed. The bodies are the proof. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Contributing factors</a>.</p><h3 id=policy-on-the-table-fewer-lanes-for-the-unprotected>Policy on the table: fewer lanes for the unprotected</h3><p>Even as the toll runs high, a local bill in City Hall moves to erase the city’s protected bike and bus lane targets. Council Member Vickie Paladino sponsored <strong>Int 1362-2025</strong>, which, in the Council’s own summary, “would remove the bus lane and bike lane quotas from the Streets Master Plan.” The measure sits in committee. No vote yet. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file</a>.</p><p>On the highways, a Queens man drove the wrong way on the Clearview Expressway and crashed into cars. In court he said, “I entered the Clearview Expressway in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people and I felt ‘liberated’ by what I had done.” A judge gave him eight years. The district attorney said he “terrorized other drivers.” These are their words. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>: “You want to fight?”; “terrorized other drivers.”</p><h3 id=slow-it-down-or-count-the-bodies>Slow it down or count the bodies</h3><p>Unsafe speed killed here. It killed on Main Street. It killed by the food trucks and airport this month elsewhere in Queens, where a driver hit a man and fled. The police said, “The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>Daily News</a>. The same morning, ABC7 reported: “The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man.” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>. Gothamist added the location and the death. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>Citywide, lawmakers took one step toward speed control. The State Senate moved a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat violators. Senator John Liu voted yes; he also co-sponsored. The bill targets drivers who rack up points or camera tickets. It passed committee votes in June. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file S 4045</a>.</p><h3 id=what-to-fix-on-these-blocks>What to fix on these blocks</h3><ul><li>Harden left turns and daylight corners where people are getting hit: Bowne at 41st, College Point at Blossom, and along Main Street. The deaths say where to start. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash logs</a>.</li><li>Cut speed on feeders to the expressways. Nights and evenings show the worst toll. Target those hours. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly data</a>.</li><li>Keep protected lanes in the Streets Master Plan. Removing quotas erases the promise to the unprotected. The bill would do that. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1362-2025</a>.</li></ul><p>The math in this board is simple and cruel: more speed, more dead. City Hall can lower limits and enforce them. Albany already moved on the worst repeat speeders. The city can do its part. Slow the cars. Save the people.</p><p>Take one step now. Ask leaders to drop default speeds and rein in repeat speeders. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>act to slow the streets</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
