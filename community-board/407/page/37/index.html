The mayor’s team scrambles, but time runs out.</p><p class=mb3>On May 10, 2022, critics blasted Mayor Eric Adams’ Albany efforts to secure key NYC priorities, including the renewal and expansion of speed and red light camera programs. The matter, covered in the article 'Critics slam Eric Adams’ Albany efforts on NYC priorities,' highlights City Hall’s inconsistent lobbying as the legislative session neared its end. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez was sent to push for stalled camera legislation, but lawmakers like State Sen. John Liu said the mayor’s direct engagement was lacking. Andrea Stewart-Cousins, mentioned in the coverage, is a key Albany figure. The bill’s fate remains uncertain. If the cameras expire, enforcement near schools vanishes, exposing pedestrians and cyclists to greater risk. The city’s last-minute push may not be enough to protect its most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
