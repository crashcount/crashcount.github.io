Over one thousand are hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, Queens CB7 saw 1,722 crashes, 1,027 injuries, and 31 serious injuries. Two of the dead were over 75. One was a child. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>A 78-year-old woman tried to cross Northern Boulevard. She did not make it. The driver kept going. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo;</a> Her name did not make the news. The minivan did not stop. No arrests. No answers.</p><p>At 32nd Avenue and 138th Street, a car hit a man and a child. The man was pinned under the car. The child was between eight and ten. Both went to the hospital. The man was in critical condition. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.</a></p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They say they are making streets safer. But the numbers do not lie. In the last year, crashes and injuries rose. Deaths did not fall. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Speed cameras save lives, but Albany lets the law expire and come up for renewal again and again. Each delay is another body in the road.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed 10 people and left 24 with serious injuries. Trucks and buses caused serious injuries, but no deaths. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. Bikes caused injuries, but no deaths. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the harm.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-waiting>The Cost of Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means more blood on the street.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit now. The state can keep speed cameras running. Local leaders can act, or they can wait for the next siren. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and permanent speed cameras. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
