Adams made them permanent, but cut enforcement hours. Illegal parking still chokes lanes. Riders wait. Drivers fume. Cameras catch some, but not all. Streets stay dangerous. The city drags its feet.</p><p class=mb3>This report examines four busways implemented in 2020 and 2021 during Mayor de Blasio’s final years. The projects—Jay Street, West 181st Street, Flushing Main Street, and Archer/Jamaica avenues—were made permanent by Mayor Adams, though enforcement hours were reduced on most. The article notes: “Four busways announced and implemented in 2020 and 2021 during the latter days of the de Blasio administration appear to have sped up service for transit riders, according to official MTA bus speed data.” Bus operators like Orlando Tejeda and Anita Mealy describe persistent illegal parking and double-parking, which slows buses and endangers riders. Despite camera enforcement, violations remain rampant. Council Member Peter Koo opposed the Flushing busway, but it survived legal and political attacks. Riders and drivers report faster trips, but the city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users at risk. The city’s promise of safer, faster streets is only half-kept.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled "City Traffic Helps Make Bus Service Unbearable, Expensive And Difficult To Improve," highlights how traffic congestion, double-parking, and outdated routes cripple bus efficiency. State Sen. John Liu urges more service in neighborhoods where buses can move. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says, "With better service, the path to more service is a much clearer one." ABLE cameras have improved bus speeds by 5 percent on enforced routes. Despite promises, Mayor Eric Adams has not delivered on expanding bus lanes. The MTA and advocates call for more funding and better service. Riders remain stuck, exposed to traffic danger, while systemic failures persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
