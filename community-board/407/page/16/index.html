Since 2022, 23 people have died and 3,236 have been injured in crashes here. Eighty-five suffered injuries so severe they will never be the same. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, children, elders—the man who never made it home, the woman left broken at the curb.</p><p>Last month, a bus jumped the curb at 57th Road and Main Street. Seven people were hurt. A passenger, clutching her child, said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.&rdquo;</a> The bus driver, just 25, told police he misjudged the curb. Later, video showed he may have fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation drags on. Another rider said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo;</a> as the pole stood bent and the sidewalk scarred.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. In the last twelve months, three people died and 1,111 were hurt in crashes here. Children, elders, and those on foot or bike are most likely to pay with their bodies. Cars and SUVs are the main killers, responsible for most deaths and injuries. The violence is steady. It does not stop for rain, sun, or the school bell.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Some steps forward, too many sideways. Council Member Sandra Ung has co-sponsored bills for speed humps, raised crosswalks, and better lighting. She backed a study on safer street design. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a move proven to protect the vulnerable—she was absent. Council Member Vickie Paladino voted no. She did, however, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>celebrate new car-free school streets</a>, calling them a win for children’s safety.</p><p>Senator John Liu voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill that would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, another family is shattered. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for those who walk and ride. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city adds more car-free zones for kids. Streets once deadly will now be safer for walking, play, and learning. The move targets neighborhoods hit hardest by crashes.</p><p class=mb3>On August 29, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a record 71 school streets will close to cars this fall. The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A motorcycle traveling westbound struck the right rear bumper of a westbound sedan. The motorcyclist, an 18-year-old male wearing a helmet, sustained abrasions and injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot but was conscious and not ejected. The report identifies 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Following Too Closely' as the primary contributing factors, both attributed to the motorcyclist. The sedan driver was licensed and traveling straight ahead with no reported violations. The impact point was the motorcycle's center front end hitting the sedan's right rear bumper, causing damage to both vehicles. The collision highlights driver errors related to speed and distance management on a high-speed expressway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
