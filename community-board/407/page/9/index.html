The article reports, "On Tuesday, police charged him with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to exercise due care, both misdemeanors." Jean-Baptiste, driving a Dodge Ram, turned left and hit Jimenez as he crossed the busy intersection. Jimenez suffered a massive head injury and died a week later. The driver remained at the scene and was later given a desk appearance ticket. This case highlights persistent risks at major crossings and the delay in holding drivers accountable for failing to yield and exercise care.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
