Thirty-four were seriously injured. Most were walking, biking, or just trying to get home. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In three years, cars and SUVs killed 10, seriously injured 26, and left 154 with moderate wounds. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes and mopeds, almost none. The street is not a fair fight.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, New York can set its own speed limits. But the limit is not yet 20 mph. The law sits. The streets wait. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them on. Each year, the clock runs down.</p><p>No local official has spoken out in these latest deaths. No new redesigns have come for the worst crossings. The silence is heavy. The blood dries, but the danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Every delay is another family broken.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets built for people, not for speed.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Riley is the primary sponsor, joined by Ariola, Joseph, Moya, Won, Banks, Narcisse, Paladino, and Marmorato. Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children.

The bill, sponsored by Councilmember Bob Holden, claims to address 'the proliferation of these vehicles' and their impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety. Councilmember Vickie Paladino, District 19, insisted, 'This is a safety issue.' Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez countered, 'We agree with the intent, but we believe that mandating registration and licensing is not a solution.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams warned the bill would 'have a disparate impact on low-income individuals, people of color, and undocumented migrants.' A separate resolution from Councilmember Gale Brewer supports licensing only for commercial e-bikes.

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Erik Bottcher (District 3), passed through committee and aims to address neglected, broken, and obstructive newspaper boxes. The bill summary states it will 'establish clear guidelines and help ensure that our local publications get to maintain their newsracks while also helping to alleviate sidewalk congestion.' Bottcher’s action brings new requirements: owners must display contact information, and the Department of Transportation gains authority to set size, shape, and material standards. Sandra Ung, another council member, noted that without oversight, newsracks become a blight.
