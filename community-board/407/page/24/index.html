Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said, “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway and crashed into multiple cars.” Lee told police he entered the expressway “in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people and I felt &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; by what I had done.” (amNY coverage).</p><h2 id=where-it-keeps-happening>Where It Keeps Happening</h2><p>The Cross Island Parkway and the Whitestone Expressway are repeat hotspots. Deaths cluster in the evening; fatalities spike between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. Small‑area data show unsafe speed and failure to yield among the recurring factors. Cars and SUVs account for most pedestrian deaths and injuries in the district.</p><p>Fixes that would cut risk here and now:</p><ul><li>Daylighting and leading‑pedestrian intervals (LPIs) at Main Street and Northern Boulevard to shorten crossing distances and give people on foot a head start.</li><li>Protected space and hardened turns on Northern Boulevard and College Point Boulevard to separate people walking and riding from fast cars.</li><li>Targeted nighttime speed enforcement and better lighting on parkway service roads to blunt the evening spike.</li></ul><h2 id=leaders-moves--and-missed-chances>Leaders’ Moves — and Missed Chances</h2><p>Council Member Vickie Paladino sponsored a bill that would remove protected bike‑lane and bus‑lane benchmarks from the Streets Master Plan; the measure sits in committee (Int 1362‑2025). State Senator John Liu voted yes in committee on S4045, the state bill to require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for habitual violators.</p><p>City council and the mayor can act locally. Keep the protected‑lane targets in the Streets Master Plan. Fund daylighting and LPIs at CB7 hotspots. And demand the city lower default speeds on local streets.</p><h2 id=citywide-fixes>Citywide Fixes</h2><p>Local patterns need citywide answers. Lowering New York City’s default speed limit to 20 mph would cut the force that turns mistakes into deaths. Requiring intelligent speed‑assistance devices for repeat offenders, as S4045 proposes, would force the worst drivers to slow down. These are practical, tested tools: speed limits and speed‑limiting tech save lives and focus enforcement where it matters (see S4045 and the Council file Int 1362‑2025).</p><h2 id=act-now>Act Now</h2><p>Call your council member and state legislators. Tell them to oppose removing lane targets (Int 1362‑2025), pass speed‑limiter requirements for repeat speeders (S4045), and lower local street speeds. Demand daylighting and LPIs on Main and Northern, protected space on Northern and College Point Boulevard, and night speed enforcement on parkway service roads. The bodies are here. Leaders must act before more families lose someone they love.</p><h2 id=sources>Sources</h2><ul><li>NYC Open Data motor‑vehicle crash records.</li><li>amNY reporting on the Clearview Expressway wrong‑way case (coverage of DA Katz statements and defendant admission).</li></ul></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The narrative states he suffered crush injuries to his entire body yet remained conscious at the scene. The vehicle involved fled, leaving the man behind, his injuries described as 'entire body' and 'crush injuries.' The police report does not specify the type of vehicle, the direction of travel, or any contributing factors from the driver, but it makes clear the driver left the scene without stopping. No driver errors are explicitly listed in the data, but the act of fleeing after a collision is a grave systemic failure. No contributing factors are attributed to the pedestrian. The report centers the violence of the impact and the abandonment that followed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
