One was a 78-year-old woman, struck and left to die on Northern Boulevard. The driver did not stop. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo;</a> Another day, a man and a child were hit at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man was pinned under the car. The child was sent to the hospital. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>&ldquo;Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, 1,029 people have been hurt here. Thirty-four were seriously injured. Most were walking, biking, or just trying to get home. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In three years, cars and SUVs killed 10, seriously injured 26, and left 154 with moderate wounds. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes and mopeds, almost none. The street is not a fair fight.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, New York can set its own speed limits. But the limit is not yet 20 mph. The law sits. The streets wait. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them on. Each year, the clock runs down.</p><p>No local official has spoken out in these latest deaths. No new redesigns have come for the worst crossings. The silence is heavy. The blood dries, but the danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Every delay is another family broken.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets built for people, not for speed.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
