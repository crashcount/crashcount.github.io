The last was just days ago: a 76-year-old woman crossing 86th Street at 18th Avenue. She made it to the intersection. She did not make it home. The city records say only this: &ldquo;Apparent Death.&rdquo;</p><p>In the past year, 483 people have been hurt and 5 seriously injured in crashes here. The old and the young are not spared. Two children under 18 were hit every week. Two people over 75 died. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h3 id=the-usual-killers>The Usual Killers</h3><p>SUVs and trucks do the most damage. In three years, SUVs killed three people and hurt 326. Trucks killed two. Bikes killed one. The city calls these collisions. The street calls them endings.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Assembly Member William Colton voted yes to extend school speed zones. Senator Steve Chan voted no. Chan did vote yes to require speed-limiting devices for repeat speeders, but only after years of delay.

On April 16, 2023, Trujillo drove his Volvo at 72 mph—nearly triple the speed limit—through a red light at Atlantic Ave and Clinton Street in Brooklyn. He struck pedestrian Katherine Harris, 31, killing her instantly, then rear-ended another car and crashed into an outdoor dining shed. Trujillo's blood alcohol level was .17, more than twice the legal limit. The article quotes Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez: "This defendant made a disastrous decision when he got behind the wheel of a car while intoxicated." The case highlights the lethal consequences of impaired driving and excessive speed, underscoring systemic risks for pedestrians in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
