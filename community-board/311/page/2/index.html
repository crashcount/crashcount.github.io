Twenty seriously injured.</strong> Nearly two thousand injured since 2022. The dead include a 95-year-old woman, an 81-year-old crossing with the light, a mother and her two daughters on a Saturday afternoon. The youngest victim was two. The oldest, nearly a century old. Each one had a name. Each one had a place to be.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs alone took three lives and left dozens more hurt. Trucks killed two. Bikes, one.

The city rejected Lyft’s plan to add speedometers, demanding immediate compliance. Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule. The move highlights rising e-bike use and the city’s struggle to manage micromobility safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
