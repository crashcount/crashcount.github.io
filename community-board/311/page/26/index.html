Twenty more are maimed for life.</strong> In just the last twelve months, Brooklyn CB11 saw 968 crashes. Six people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. <strong>One death this year.</strong> One family shattered. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The dead are old and young. A 95-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing at Cropsey and 24th. A 66-year-old woman, killed with a child at her side on Bath Avenue. An 81-year-old, hit by a truck turning left at 85th and 15th. The numbers keep coming. The bodies do not get up.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A son stands in the street.

She also co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists and a bill to register e-bikes—laws that shift the burden onto those most at risk. She voted against ending jaywalking enforcement, a law proven to protect the vulnerable. She voted yes to greener medians, a small step for those on foot.</p><p><strong>Assembly Member William Colton</strong> has backed bills for safer streets and school speed cameras. <strong>State Senator Steve Chan</strong> voted against renewing speed cameras in school zones (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against renewing speed cameras</a>). He supports insurance for delivery apps (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>supports insurance for delivery apps</a>), but not the laws that stop cars from killing in the first place.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> The bills that would slow cars, daylight corners, and end repeat speeding are stalled or watered down. The laws that punish the vulnerable move fast.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not an accident.</strong> It is a choice. Every day the speed limit stays high, every day a crosswalk stays blocked, another family waits for a call that never should come.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your assembly member.
