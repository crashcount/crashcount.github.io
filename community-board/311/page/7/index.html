Twenty seriously injured.</strong> Nearly two thousand injured since 2022. The dead include a 95-year-old woman, an 81-year-old crossing with the light, a mother and her two daughters on a Saturday afternoon. The youngest victim was two. The oldest, nearly a century old. Each one had a name. Each one had a place to be.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs alone took three lives and left dozens more hurt. Trucks killed two. Bikes, one. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but they punish the vulnerable most of all.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-again-and-again>The System Fails, Again and Again</h2><p><strong>Repeat offenders drive on.</strong> In March, a driver with a suspended license and over 90 violations mowed down a family in Gravesend. The car had twenty speeding tickets and five red-light violations in less than two years. Still, it was on the road. Still, no one stopped her. Dashcam footage shows the Audi <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/driver-accused-of-fatally-mowing-down-nyc-mom-kids-told-emts-she-had-the-devil-in-me-sources/>mowing down the family as they crossed the road</a>.</p><p>After the crash, the driver refused to speak to police.

I&rsquo;m haunted inside. I didn&rsquo;t kill anyone. I don&rsquo;t hurt anyone. Prove it. Show me proof,&rdquo;</a> she told prosecutors.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h2><p><strong>The city has tools. It does not always use them.</strong> Speed cameras slash speeding by 63% where installed. The city can now set speed limits at 20 mph, but most streets remain unchanged. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Calls for its renewal go unanswered. Cameras face expiration unless Albany acts.</p><p>Local leaders praise Vision Zero. They promise that &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; But promises do not slow cars. Promises do not bring back the dead.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand the city take the keys from repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another family to be broken.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
