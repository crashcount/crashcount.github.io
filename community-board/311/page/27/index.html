The city records say only this: &ldquo;Apparent Death.&rdquo;</p><p>In the past year, 483 people have been hurt and 5 seriously injured in crashes here. The old and the young are not spared. Two children under 18 were hit every week. Two people over 75 died.

Trucks killed two. Bikes killed one. The city calls these collisions. The street calls them endings.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Assembly Member William Colton voted yes to extend school speed zones.
