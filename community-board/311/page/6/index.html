Twenty seriously injured.</strong> Nearly two thousand injured since 2022. The dead include a 95-year-old woman, an 81-year-old crossing with the light, a mother and her two daughters on a Saturday afternoon. The youngest victim was two. The oldest, nearly a century old. Each one had a name. Each one had a place to be.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs alone took three lives and left dozens more hurt. Trucks killed two. Bikes, one. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but they punish the vulnerable most of all.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-again-and-again>The System Fails, Again and Again</h2><p><strong>Repeat offenders drive on.</strong> In March, a driver with a suspended license and over 90 violations mowed down a family in Gravesend. The car had twenty speeding tickets and five red-light violations in less than two years. Still, it was on the road. Still, no one stopped her. Dashcam footage shows the Audi <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/driver-accused-of-fatally-mowing-down-nyc-mom-kids-told-emts-she-had-the-devil-in-me-sources/>mowing down the family as they crossed the road</a>.</p><p>After the crash, the driver refused to speak to police.

I&rsquo;m haunted inside. I didn&rsquo;t kill anyone. I don&rsquo;t hurt anyone. Prove it. Show me proof,&rdquo;</a> she told prosecutors.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h2><p><strong>The city has tools. It does not always use them.</strong> Speed cameras slash speeding by 63% where installed. The city can now set speed limits at 20 mph, but most streets remain unchanged. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Calls for its renewal go unanswered. Cameras face expiration unless Albany acts.</p><p>Local leaders praise Vision Zero. They promise that &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; But promises do not slow cars. Promises do not bring back the dead.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand the city take the keys from repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another family to be broken.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Bus lanes, train upgrades, and green space fights mark a city in flux.</p><p class=mb3>This roundup, published December 31, 2024, surveys Brooklyn’s major transportation and public safety stories for 2025. Council Member Susan Zhuang (District 43) was arrested and charged with assault during a protest against a Gravesend homeless shelter, highlighting fierce local opposition. The city’s new ban on vendors along the Brooklyn Bridge walkway took effect in January, aiming to reduce sidewalk congestion and improve pedestrian safety. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway’s long-awaited renovation faces further delays, with major construction not expected until 2029; short-term fixes are planned. The MTA upgraded the G train’s signal system, promising better service. Flatbush Avenue may see new bus lanes to speed up transit. The article quotes City Hall calling the bridge vendor ban a 'public safety issue due to the sprawling stalls taking up sidewalk space and causing congestion for pedestrians.' Zhuang’s arrest and the city’s actions underscore the ongoing tension between public safety, mobility, and community resistance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
