Twenty seriously injured.</strong> Nearly two thousand injured since 2022. The dead include a 95-year-old woman, an 81-year-old crossing with the light, a mother and her two daughters on a Saturday afternoon. The youngest victim was two. The oldest, nearly a century old. Each one had a name. Each one had a place to be.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs alone took three lives and left dozens more hurt. Trucks killed two. Bikes, one.

According to the NYPD, 'a man driving a cargo van struck both of them while making a left turn.' Gil died from her injuries; her aide was hospitalized. Police did not arrest or charge the driver. The article notes that Gil was the second elderly pedestrian killed in Brooklyn this year, and cites Transportation Alternatives: '46 senior pedestrians were killed in car crashes across the city last year.' The crash highlights the ongoing risk seniors face on city streets, especially at intersections where turning vehicles endanger those crossing on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Susan Zhuang (District 43) was arrested and charged with assault during a protest against a Gravesend homeless shelter, highlighting fierce local opposition. The city’s new ban on vendors along the Brooklyn Bridge walkway took effect in January, aiming to reduce sidewalk congestion and improve pedestrian safety. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway’s long-awaited renovation faces further delays, with major construction not expected until 2029; short-term fixes are planned. The MTA upgraded the G train’s signal system, promising better service. Flatbush Avenue may see new bus lanes to speed up transit. The article quotes City Hall calling the bridge vendor ban a 'public safety issue due to the sprawling stalls taking up sidewalk space and causing congestion for pedestrians.'
