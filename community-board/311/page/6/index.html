Twenty more are maimed for life.</strong> In just the last twelve months, Brooklyn CB11 saw 968 crashes. Six people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. <strong>One death this year.</strong> One family shattered. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The dead are old and young. A 95-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing at Cropsey and 24th. A 66-year-old woman, killed with a child at her side on Bath Avenue. An 81-year-old, hit by a truck turning left at 85th and 15th. The numbers keep coming. The bodies do not get up.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A son stands in the street.

She also co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists and a bill to register e-bikes—laws that shift the burden onto those most at risk. She voted against ending jaywalking enforcement, a law proven to protect the vulnerable. She voted yes to greener medians, a small step for those on foot.</p><p><strong>Assembly Member William Colton</strong> has backed bills for safer streets and school speed cameras. <strong>State Senator Steve Chan</strong> voted against renewing speed cameras in school zones (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against renewing speed cameras</a>). He supports insurance for delivery apps (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>supports insurance for delivery apps</a>), but not the laws that stop cars from killing in the first place.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> The bills that would slow cars, daylight corners, and end repeat speeding are stalled or watered down. The laws that punish the vulnerable move fast.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not an accident.</strong> It is a choice. Every day the speed limit stays high, every day a crosswalk stays blocked, another family waits for a call that never should come.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your assembly member.

Prosecutors say Yarimi sped through a red light, collided with another car, and hit the family, killing Saada and two daughters. Her son remains in a coma. Yarimi’s license was suspended and her car had nearly $11,000 in violations, including 21 speed camera and five red light tickets. Black box data revealed Yarimi never braked. Brooklyn D.A. Eric Gonzalez called it 'one of the worst collisions I've ever seen on a New York City street.' Yarimi faces charges of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and assault, highlighting systemic failures in license enforcement and traffic violation accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
