The last was just days ago: a 76-year-old woman crossing 86th Street at 18th Avenue. She made it to the intersection. She did not make it home. The city records say only this: &ldquo;Apparent Death.&rdquo;</p><p>In the past year, 483 people have been hurt and 5 seriously injured in crashes here. The old and the young are not spared. Two children under 18 were hit every week. Two people over 75 died. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h3 id=the-usual-killers>The Usual Killers</h3><p>SUVs and trucks do the most damage. In three years, SUVs killed three people and hurt 326. Trucks killed two. Bikes killed one. The city calls these collisions. The street calls them endings.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Assembly Member William Colton voted yes to extend school speed zones. Senator Steve Chan voted no. Chan did vote yes to require speed-limiting devices for repeat speeders, but only after years of delay.

They are wide, fast, and deadly for walkers and cyclists. Most are state-owned. Cities and advocates demand lower speeds, urban design, and local control. Changing these streets is urgent. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy statement, published October 18, 2022, by Streetsblog NYC, highlights the urgent need to fix deadly arterial roads. The statement, titled 'Vision Zero Cities: How to Fix Our Most Dangerous Roads,' calls for context-sensitive speed limits, urban street design standards, and transferring state-owned roads to city control. Streetsblog and Transportation Alternatives urge, 'Cities and advocates should push their states to transform arterial streets into safe spaces for all modes.' The statement notes that arterials make up 15 percent of roads but see 67 percent of pedestrian deaths. It stresses that speed is the main factor in fatal crashes and that state DOTs often prioritize fast driving over safety. The call is clear: redesign streets for people, not cars, and give cities the power to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
