Twenty more are maimed for life.</strong> In just the last twelve months, Brooklyn CB11 saw 968 crashes. Six people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. <strong>One death this year.</strong> One family shattered. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The dead are old and young. A 95-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing at Cropsey and 24th. A 66-year-old woman, killed with a child at her side on Bath Avenue. An 81-year-old, hit by a truck turning left at 85th and 15th. The numbers keep coming. The bodies do not get up.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A son stands in the street.

She also co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists and a bill to register e-bikes—laws that shift the burden onto those most at risk. She voted against ending jaywalking enforcement, a law proven to protect the vulnerable. She voted yes to greener medians, a small step for those on foot.</p><p><strong>Assembly Member William Colton</strong> has backed bills for safer streets and school speed cameras. <strong>State Senator Steve Chan</strong> voted against renewing speed cameras in school zones (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against renewing speed cameras</a>). He supports insurance for delivery apps (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>supports insurance for delivery apps</a>), but not the laws that stop cars from killing in the first place.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> The bills that would slow cars, daylight corners, and end repeat speeding are stalled or watered down. The laws that punish the vulnerable move fast.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not an accident.</strong> It is a choice. Every day the speed limit stays high, every day a crosswalk stays blocked, another family waits for a call that never should come.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your assembly member.

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous.
