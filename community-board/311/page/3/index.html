The last was just days ago: a 76-year-old woman crossing 86th Street at 18th Avenue. She made it to the intersection. She did not make it home. The city records say only this: &ldquo;Apparent Death.&rdquo;</p><p>In the past year, 483 people have been hurt and 5 seriously injured in crashes here. The old and the young are not spared. Two children under 18 were hit every week. Two people over 75 died. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h3 id=the-usual-killers>The Usual Killers</h3><p>SUVs and trucks do the most damage. In three years, SUVs killed three people and hurt 326. Trucks killed two. Bikes killed one. The city calls these collisions. The street calls them endings.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Assembly Member William Colton voted yes to extend school speed zones. Senator Steve Chan voted no. Chan did vote yes to require speed-limiting devices for repeat speeders, but only after years of delay. The carnage did not wait.</p><p>A man who lost a friend on Morgan Avenue <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>said</a>, &ldquo;I was sad and angry at the same time because I still feel that these are things that can be prevented. I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed.&rdquo;</p><p>Polly Trottenberg, former DOT commissioner, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>put it plain</a>: &ldquo;In areas that were formally industrial—a lot of trucks, lot of heavy construction activity—that are becoming residential where cycling is more popular, we’re unfortunately seeing a lot of collisions with cyclists and trucks.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-disaster-is-slow-but-it-is-here>The Disaster Is Slow, But It Is Here</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day without action is a choice. The dead do not get a second chance. The living do.</p><p>Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every block. Demand action before another name becomes a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The lane stays for now. Cyclists and pedestrians remain shielded. The fight over safety and street space continues. The city must wait for court.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 18, 2025, that Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Carolyn Walker-Diallo blocked Mayor Adams from removing the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. The city must wait until an August hearing before making changes. The ruling follows a lawsuit by Transportation Alternatives, who argued Adams 'abused his discretion' by ordering the lane reverted to its unprotected design. The city had cited community feedback and a viral video of a child struck by an e-bike as reasons for removal. The Department of Transportation installed the protected lane after five pedestrian deaths in 2021 and 2022. Local lawmakers protested the removal, calling the process hasty. The judge’s order keeps the safety improvements in place, pausing the city’s plan to restore curbside parking and expose cyclists to traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The mayor cited 'community concerns' and stated, 'After several incidents—including some involving children...we decided to adjust the current design.' City Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the move, calling it 'pure politics' and warning, 'He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists.'

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
