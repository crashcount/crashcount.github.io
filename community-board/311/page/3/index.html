Twenty seriously injured.</strong> Nearly two thousand injured since 2022. The dead include a 95-year-old woman, an 81-year-old crossing with the light, a mother and her two daughters on a Saturday afternoon. The youngest victim was two. The oldest, nearly a century old. Each one had a name. Each one had a place to be.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs alone took three lives and left dozens more hurt. Trucks killed two. Bikes, one. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but they punish the vulnerable most of all.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-again-and-again>The System Fails, Again and Again</h2><p><strong>Repeat offenders drive on.</strong> In March, a driver with a suspended license and over 90 violations mowed down a family in Gravesend. The car had twenty speeding tickets and five red-light violations in less than two years. Still, it was on the road. Still, no one stopped her. Dashcam footage shows the Audi <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/driver-accused-of-fatally-mowing-down-nyc-mom-kids-told-emts-she-had-the-devil-in-me-sources/>mowing down the family as they crossed the road</a>.</p><p>After the crash, the driver refused to speak to police. She asked only for a lawyer. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/06/us-news/unhinged-wigmaker-accused-of-attacking-brooklyn-neighbor-with-hammer-before-killing-mom-kids-in-nyc-car-crash-court-docs/>&ldquo;The devil&rsquo;s in my eyes. I&rsquo;m haunted inside. I didn&rsquo;t kill anyone. I don&rsquo;t hurt anyone. Prove it. Show me proof,&rdquo;</a> she told prosecutors.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h2><p><strong>The city has tools. It does not always use them.</strong> Speed cameras slash speeding by 63% where installed. The city can now set speed limits at 20 mph, but most streets remain unchanged. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Calls for its renewal go unanswered. Cameras face expiration unless Albany acts.</p><p>Local leaders praise Vision Zero. They promise that &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; But promises do not slow cars. Promises do not bring back the dead.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand the city take the keys from repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another family to be broken.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article states, "She was arrested Wednesday following a police investigation, and was charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian, and failure to exercise due care, cops said." Martin hit Henriquez while turning left; Henriquez died later that day. The driver remained at the scene. The charges highlight driver error—failure to yield and lack of due care.

One driver collected 563 speed-camera tickets in Sheepshead Bay; another, 474 in Manhattan. The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low. The report highlights a small group’s outsized threat and the policy gap that lets them keep driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver had a suspended license and a record of violations. Lawmakers now press for speed limiters on repeat offenders. The city mourns. The system failed to stop the car.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-04-01) reports renewed calls for the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill after a Brooklyn crash killed a mother and two children. The driver, with a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' struck the family as they crossed the street. The bill would require speed-limiting technology for drivers with repeated offenses—those with 11 or more points in 24 months, or six camera tickets in a year. Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, citing the crash, demand action: 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair... it’s time for us to act.' The incident highlights gaps in enforcement and the stalled progress of safety legislation meant to curb reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
