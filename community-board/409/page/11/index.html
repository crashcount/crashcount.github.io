Over 400 injured.</strong> That’s just this year in Queens CB9. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement, families left with empty chairs. In the last twelve months, five people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Eleven have died since 2022. The dead do not get second chances.</p><p>Last month, a sedan struck a pedestrian on 131st Street. In June, another walker was hit at 101st Avenue and 116th Street. The pattern does not break. It only repeats. <strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage</strong>—five killed, hundreds hurt. Trucks turned, sedans sped, and people bled. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes all the same.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Some leaders act. <strong>Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called the carnage what it is: &ldquo;traffic violence,&rdquo;</strong> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/02/23/dot-commish-promises-safety-improvements-at-queens-intersection-where-pedestrian-was-run-over-three-times>demanded the city take control of speed limits and cameras</a>. <strong>State Senator Joe Addabbo <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a></strong>—a move that protects children at the curb. These are steps, not solutions. The blood still runs.</p><p>But not all stand with the vulnerable. <strong>Council Member Joann Ariola <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>voted against expanding speed cameras</a></strong>. She called them a burden, even as her own car racked up 27 school zone speeding tickets. The cameras work. The votes say who matters.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made upstream. Lower the speed limit. Expand cameras. Take the keys from repeat offenders. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call until the killing stops.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;I wish they would never have given him that car. I wish they would never think about giving him that car—because if they didn&rsquo;t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>said Keisha Francis</a>, after her 14-year-old was killed by an unlicensed teen driver.

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cabán’s platform promised safer streets and fewer cars. Ariola and others say the tickets show a gap between words and actions.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2024, Councilwoman Joann Ariola (District 32) publicly criticized Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán after media reports revealed Cabán received four school-zone speeding tickets and three other violations since November 2022. The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Woodhaven) opposed more housing in her district, calling it 'suburbs.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized neighborhoods that refuse new housing, saying it increases pressure on poorer areas. Arlene Schlesinger, a Queens resident, voiced strong opposition, especially to lifting parking mandates and adding accessory dwelling units.

The proposal aims to increase housing near transit, allow mixed-use zoning, and eliminate parking mandates.

Other Queens officials and residents echoed fears for single-family homeowners and suburban 'character.' In contrast, Borough President Donovan Richards's spokesperson and some residents supported the reforms, citing the city's affordability crisis.
