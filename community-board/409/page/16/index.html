It happened just before midnight on 101st Avenue in Ozone Park. The driver did not stop. The man was found unresponsive on the road. He is not a statistic to his family. But to the city, he is one more number in a long line, as <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>reported by ABC7</a>.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, a van driver lost control and killed Zhihong Shi, 31, as he exited a double-parked car. Two others were hurt. The van driver had a medical episode. The street did not forgive the mistake. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Shi and the other victims, ages 67 and 48, were all rushed to Jamaica Hospital, but Shi could not be saved.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.

The city can set speed limits lower, thanks to Sammy’s Law. But the pace is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. Cameras need reauthorization. The city can lower speeds to 20 mph but has not done so citywide.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city can act.

The debate centers on just 5,200 drivers. Most New Yorkers use transit. Opponents claim harm to businesses and residents. Data shows broad benefit. The city stands at a crossroads.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2023, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) was mentioned in a public debate over New York City's congestion pricing policy. The matter, titled 'Straw Men: The Fight Over Congestion Pricing Comes Down to Just 5,200 NYC Drivers,' highlights that only 1.2% of residents far from fast transit drive into the congestion zone. Ariola, along with other council members, voiced concerns about impacts on small businesses and residents. The debate draws on MTA data showing most New Yorkers rely on public transit, not cars. Exemptions and discounts for disabled and low-income drivers are included in the policy. Advocates argue congestion pricing will reduce traffic, fund transit, and transform city streets for vulnerable road users. The council's discussion reflects a sharp divide between data and political narrative.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

High-crash intersections must be prioritized unless deemed infeasible. DOT must also install physical daylighting features, such as planters or bike corrals, where possible. Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hudson, Ossé, and others. The law took effect 90 days after enactment. DOT must report annually on locations and reasons for any exceptions.

Lawmakers want more frequent, reliable, and affordable transit. They warn of a looming fiscal cliff. Without action, riders face service cuts. The vote backs millions who depend on buses and trains.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0460-2023 was adopted by the City Council on April 27, 2023, after review by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the bill, joined by co-sponsors including Amanda Farías, Tiffany Cabán, and others. The council voted overwhelmingly in favor on April 27, 2023. The law requires the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Department for the Aging, to annually install at least one traffic calming device in each designated senior pedestrian zone, with a minimum of fifty devices citywide per year. DOT must report installation locations to the council every year.
