Over 400 injured.</strong> That’s just this year in Queens CB9. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement, families left with empty chairs. In the last twelve months, five people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Eleven have died since 2022. The dead do not get second chances.</p><p>Last month, a sedan struck a pedestrian on 131st Street. In June, another walker was hit at 101st Avenue and 116th Street. The pattern does not break. It only repeats. <strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage</strong>—five killed, hundreds hurt. Trucks turned, sedans sped, and people bled. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes all the same.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Some leaders act. <strong>Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called the carnage what it is: &ldquo;traffic violence,&rdquo;</strong> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/02/23/dot-commish-promises-safety-improvements-at-queens-intersection-where-pedestrian-was-run-over-three-times>demanded the city take control of speed limits and cameras</a>. <strong>State Senator Joe Addabbo <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a></strong>—a move that protects children at the curb. These are steps, not solutions. The blood still runs.</p><p>But not all stand with the vulnerable. <strong>Council Member Joann Ariola <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>voted against expanding speed cameras</a></strong>. She called them a burden, even as her own car racked up 27 school zone speeding tickets. The cameras work. The votes say who matters.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made upstream. Lower the speed limit. Expand cameras. Take the keys from repeat offenders. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call until the killing stops.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;I wish they would never have given him that car. I wish they would never think about giving him that car—because if they didn&rsquo;t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>said Keisha Francis</a>, after her 14-year-old was killed by an unlicensed teen driver.

Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.

Mendez-Vasquez, initially charged with criminally negligent homicide, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless driving and received probation. The DA’s office cited the family’s wishes, but advocates and family friends called the outcome a slap on the wrist. The crash sparked local activism: the community board passed a resolution for universal daylighting—removing parked cars from corners to improve visibility. Mayor Adams pledged to daylight 1,000 intersections a year, but the Department of Transportation has resisted full implementation, citing concerns about driver behavior. The city installed a traffic signal and banned parking at two corners, but systemic danger remains. The case highlights how lenient prosecution and slow policy change leave vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case, filed in Manhattan, challenges the environmental review process and seeks to block the $15 daily toll for cars entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The lawsuit claims, 'the city, state, and federal government did not do the proper review to protect citizens.' Council Member Bob Holden called the charge 'insane.' The MTA defends its review and says delays threaten $15 billion in transit upgrades. Transit advocates say the lawsuit is frivolous and congestion pricing’s benefits are clear.
