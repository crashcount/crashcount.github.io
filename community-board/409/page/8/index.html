Eleven dead. Nineteen left with wounds that will never heal.</strong> In Queens CB9, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have hit and killed 11 people. Nineteen more were left with serious injuries. The pain is not spread evenly. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street.</p><p>Just this June, a 66-year-old man was killed at the corner of 116th Street and 101st Avenue. In March, two men—one 67, one 31—were struck and killed on Atlantic Avenue. The street does not care about age. It does not care about time of day. It only takes.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A brother stands at the curb, staring at the spot where his sibling died. “He was always happy. He would make you happy. He would make happy any person in the world,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>said Avelardo Venancio</a>. The grief is raw. The loss is permanent.</p><p>A witness, still shaken, remembers the moment. “Must have been going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams and just dropped everything and ran over there, it was instant,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>said George Giakoumis</a>.</p><p><strong>Speed is the weapon.

State Senator Joe Addabbo voted yes to extend school speed zones and to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed-limiting devices. Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called out the crisis as &ldquo;traffic violence&rdquo; and demanded stronger city control over speed limits and cameras. But others drag their feet or vote no. Each delay is another risk, another life in the balance.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day someone else may die. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The matter summary reads: 'DOT plans to widen the Sixth Avenue bike lane... eliminating one of the four vehicle lanes.' Council Member Joann Ariola, mentioned in the debate, strongly opposed the move, warning it 'will seriously impede emergency responders.' Other council members and residents voiced sharp criticism, calling the redesign dangerous and disruptive. DOT officials insist the plan is rooted in community input and data.

Prosecutors say Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and t-boned a BMW, killing 23-year-old Justin Diaz. The article quotes DA Melinda Katz: "An FDNY firefighter who was off duty is accused of driving under the influence, running a steady red light and slamming into a 23-year-old motorist, killing him, as he drove more than three times the posted speed limit." Pena's blood alcohol content was .156 percent, and he allegedly had drugs in his system. The BMW was sent flying into a parked car, its roof torn off. Pena faces manslaughter and related charges.

Lives lost.</p><p class=mb3>On February 17, 2025, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) announced draft legislation to crack down on drivers who block fire hydrants. The bill, not yet numbered, would raise fines from $115 to $1,000 and allow 311 video submissions for automatic summonses. Ariola said, 'We have seen two fires in the past week that have resulted in fatalities where the firefighters were unable to access the closest fire hydrant.' The measure responds to a surge in complaints—over 134,000 in 2023—about blocked hydrants. Ariola’s office blamed lost parking to DOT bike lanes and racks, but the DOT countered, calling protected bike lanes a proven safety tool. FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker said blocked hydrants slowed firefighting in a recent fatal fire. The bill aims to keep hydrants clear and prevent more deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The white Toyota sedan hit an underpass near 225th Street around 3:50 a.m. Both occupants were found outside the wreck when police arrived. Investigators are unsure who was driving at the time of impact: 'Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven't figured out who was driving, police said.' The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive. The article highlights ongoing uncertainty about driver identity and underscores the persistent risks on city highways, especially where loss of vehicle control leads to deadly outcomes.
