Eleven dead. Nineteen left with wounds that will never heal.</strong> In Queens CB9, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have hit and killed 11 people. Nineteen more were left with serious injuries. The pain is not spread evenly. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street.</p><p>Just this June, a 66-year-old man was killed at the corner of 116th Street and 101st Avenue. In March, two men—one 67, one 31—were struck and killed on Atlantic Avenue. The street does not care about age. It does not care about time of day. It only takes.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A brother stands at the curb, staring at the spot where his sibling died. “He was always happy. He would make you happy. He would make happy any person in the world,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>said Avelardo Venancio</a>. The grief is raw. The loss is permanent.</p><p>A witness, still shaken, remembers the moment. “Must have been going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams and just dropped everything and ran over there, it was instant,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>said George Giakoumis</a>.</p><p><strong>Speed is the weapon.

State Senator Joe Addabbo voted yes to extend school speed zones and to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed-limiting devices. Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called out the crisis as &ldquo;traffic violence&rdquo; and demanded stronger city control over speed limits and cameras. But others drag their feet or vote no. Each delay is another risk, another life in the balance.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day someone else may die. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

Porous pavement, wider sidewalks, and bike lanes now line the block. The project promises less flooding and safer passage for people on foot and bike. Connections to the ferry and boardwalk improved.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2023, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) marked the completion of a major infrastructure project in Rockaway. The work, running from Beach Channel Drive to Shore Front Parkway, added porous pavement, new bike lanes, and wider pedestrian walkways. The city says the 11,000 square feet of new surface can absorb nearly 1.3 million gallons of stormwater each year. Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes. The changes give cyclists and pedestrians an easier, safer route to the Rockaway ferry terminal and boardwalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.
