Over 400 injured.</strong> That’s just this year in Queens CB9. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement, families left with empty chairs. In the last twelve months, five people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Eleven have died since 2022. The dead do not get second chances.</p><p>Last month, a sedan struck a pedestrian on 131st Street. In June, another walker was hit at 101st Avenue and 116th Street. The pattern does not break. It only repeats. <strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage</strong>—five killed, hundreds hurt. Trucks turned, sedans sped, and people bled. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes all the same.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Some leaders act. <strong>Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called the carnage what it is: &ldquo;traffic violence,&rdquo;</strong> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/02/23/dot-commish-promises-safety-improvements-at-queens-intersection-where-pedestrian-was-run-over-three-times>demanded the city take control of speed limits and cameras</a>. <strong>State Senator Joe Addabbo <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a></strong>—a move that protects children at the curb. These are steps, not solutions. The blood still runs.</p><p>But not all stand with the vulnerable. <strong>Council Member Joann Ariola <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>voted against expanding speed cameras</a></strong>. She called them a burden, even as her own car racked up 27 school zone speeding tickets. The cameras work. The votes say who matters.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made upstream. Lower the speed limit. Expand cameras. Take the keys from repeat offenders. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call until the killing stops.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;I wish they would never have given him that car. I wish they would never think about giving him that car—because if they didn&rsquo;t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>said Keisha Francis</a>, after her 14-year-old was killed by an unlicensed teen driver.

On February 26, Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and crashed into Justin Diaz’s BMW. Diaz, 23, died after being rushed to the hospital. Prosecutors say Pena’s blood-alcohol content was 0.156% and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. Surveillance footage shows Diaz had the right-of-way. The article states, “The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light, prosecutors say.” Two passengers in Pena’s car were also injured. The case highlights the lethal consequences of high-speed, impaired driving and raises questions about enforcement and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA demanded $4 billion from the city—a 33% jump from the last plan—warning of major subway disruptions if denied. The matter, titled 'MTA threatens another ‘Summer of Hell’ of subway disruptions if NYC doesn’t cough up billions,' drew sharp words. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Queens) blasted the agency: 'Instead of insulting us with baseless threats, the agency that spends $30 million on a staircase should find ways to cut its wasteful spending and bloated payroll before asking for more taxpayer money.' Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility. Despite heated criticism, council members did not strongly oppose the request in session. The hearing left the city’s most vulnerable riders—those who rely on safe, reliable transit—caught between political fights and crumbling infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
