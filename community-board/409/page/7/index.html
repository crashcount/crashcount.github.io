Over 550 injured. Three left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Queens Community Board 9 in the last year alone, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The names are not here. But the numbers are. They do not flinch.</p><h2 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h2><p>A man in his 50s lies in a hospital bed, fighting for his life after a black SUV struck him and kept going. It happened just before midnight on 101st Avenue in Ozone Park. The driver did not stop. The man was found unresponsive on the road. He is not a statistic to his family. But to the city, he is one more number in a long line, as <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>reported by ABC7</a>.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, a van driver lost control and killed Zhihong Shi, 31, as he exited a double-parked car. Two others were hurt. The van driver had a medical episode. The street did not forgive the mistake. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Shi and the other victims, ages 67 and 48, were all rushed to Jamaica Hospital, but Shi could not be saved.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.

The city can set speed limits lower, thanks to Sammy’s Law. But the pace is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. Cameras need reauthorization. The city can lower speeds to 20 mph but has not done so citywide.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city can act. The council can act. Albany can act. But the dead cannot wait. The injured cannot wait. The families cannot wait.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing.

The bill was introduced on September 12, 2024, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure the same day. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the operation of shared electric scooter systems on certain streets in the Borough of Queens.' Council Members Lynn C. Schulman (District 29, primary sponsor) and Sandra Ung (District 20, co-sponsor) back the measure. The bill would stop shared e-scooter organizations from operating in a dense, contested part of Queens. No safety analysis was provided. The legislation draws a hard line on who can move—and how—on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger.

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report explicitly identifies unsafe speed as the contributing factor for the crash, repeated twice for emphasis. Both drivers were licensed and operating their vehicles legally, but the truck driver's left turn combined with unsafe speed led to the collision.
