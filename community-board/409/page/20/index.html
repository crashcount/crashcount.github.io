Eleven dead. Nineteen left with wounds that will never heal.</strong> In Queens CB9, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have hit and killed 11 people. Nineteen more were left with serious injuries. The pain is not spread evenly. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street.</p><p>Just this June, a 66-year-old man was killed at the corner of 116th Street and 101st Avenue. In March, two men—one 67, one 31—were struck and killed on Atlantic Avenue. The street does not care about age. It does not care about time of day. It only takes.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A brother stands at the curb, staring at the spot where his sibling died. “He was always happy. He would make you happy. He would make happy any person in the world,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>said Avelardo Venancio</a>. The grief is raw. The loss is permanent.</p><p>A witness, still shaken, remembers the moment. “Must have been going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams and just dropped everything and ran over there, it was instant,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>said George Giakoumis</a>.</p><p><strong>Speed is the weapon.

State Senator Joe Addabbo voted yes to extend school speed zones and to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed-limiting devices. Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called out the crisis as &ldquo;traffic violence&rdquo; and demanded stronger city control over speed limits and cameras. But others drag their feet or vote no. Each delay is another risk, another life in the balance.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day someone else may die. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

His car had racked up 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June. Council Member Brannan and DA Katz slammed weak penalties. Most reckless drivers still face little consequence. Streets remain dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On October 21, 2022, police in Bay Ridge arrested Ibrahim Chaaban for reckless driving after he performed donuts on Shore Road. The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program.

Her SUV racked up 27 school-zone speeding tickets. She calls cameras a burden. Critics see hypocrisy. The vote blocks a tool proven to slow drivers and protect people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>On September 9, 2022, the New York City Council considered a 'home rule' message to let state lawmakers expand speed cameras to 24/7 operation. The matter summary: 'expanding New York's speed camera program.' Council Member Joann Ariola, representing southern Queens and the Rockaways, voted no. Ariola argued, 'these cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,' and claimed repeat offenders with fake plates escape punishment. Ariola’s SUV has 48 violations since 2017, including 27 for speeding in school zones and two for running red lights. She insists her record did not influence her vote. Critics, like StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure, highlight the contradiction between her opposition to speed cameras and her stated concern for school safety. The vote denied a proven measure to slow traffic and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
