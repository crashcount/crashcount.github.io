Over 550 injured. Three left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Queens Community Board 9 in the last year alone, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The names are not here. But the numbers are. They do not flinch.</p><h2 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h2><p>A man in his 50s lies in a hospital bed, fighting for his life after a black SUV struck him and kept going. It happened just before midnight on 101st Avenue in Ozone Park. The driver did not stop. The man was found unresponsive on the road. He is not a statistic to his family. But to the city, he is one more number in a long line, as <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>reported by ABC7</a>.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, a van driver lost control and killed Zhihong Shi, 31, as he exited a double-parked car. Two others were hurt. The van driver had a medical episode. The street did not forgive the mistake. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Shi and the other victims, ages 67 and 48, were all rushed to Jamaica Hospital, but Shi could not be saved.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.

The city can set speed limits lower, thanks to Sammy’s Law. But the pace is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. Cameras need reauthorization. The city can lower speeds to 20 mph but has not done so citywide.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city can act. The council can act. Albany can act. But the dead cannot wait. The injured cannot wait. The families cannot wait.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to repair any curb deemed a safety hazard during street resurfacing. The matter summary reads: 'requiring that the department of transportation repair broken curbs as part of resurfacing projects.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Schulman, Brewer, Dinowitz, Krishnan, Narcisse, Menin, Yeger, Avilés, Nurse, Gutiérrez, Riley, Brannan, Sanchez, and Louis. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. Broken curbs are a daily threat to pedestrians, especially the elderly and disabled. The bill would have forced the city to address these hazards as part of routine work, but the effort stalled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No relief in sight.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2022, Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) joined critics in a policy debate over New York City's stalled congestion pricing plan. The measure, approved by state lawmakers three years ago, would charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The MTA faces hundreds of follow-up questions from the Federal Highway Administration, delaying the required environmental assessment. Ariola argued, 'I don’t believe it will work, in fact I believe it will make the city more unmanageable to travel through.' The plan is intended to reduce traffic, lower car pollution, and fund MTA capital improvements. Delays put $1 billion in annual funding at risk, threatening upgrades like accessible subway stations and zero-emission buses. As the debate drags on, vulnerable road users remain exposed to traffic and pollution hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lynn C. Schulman sponsored the bill, joined by Kagan, Hudson, Hanif, Abreu, Restler, Riley, and Sanchez. The bill would have forced the city to install these signals at no fewer than 400 intersections each year. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No law passed. The city’s most vulnerable—kids, elders, patients—remain at risk at crossings meant to protect them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

More eyes on reckless drivers. Fewer chances for harm. The vote was clear. The danger stays in focus.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 5602, titled 'Relates to the hours of operation of a school zone speed camera demonstration program,' passed the Senate on May 25, 2022, and the Assembly on June 2, 2022. The bill extends the hours that speed cameras operate in New York City school zones. Sponsored by Senator Gounardes (District 26) with co-sponsors Biaggi, Cleare, Gianaris, Hoylman, Jackson, Kavanagh, Krueger, Myrie, Persaud, Ramos, Rivera, and Sepulveda, the measure drew strong support. The committee vote stage showed a clear majority in favor. The bill aims to keep cameras active when children are most at risk. More enforcement means fewer speeding drivers near schools. Vulnerable road users—children, parents, and school staff—remain the focus.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill increases state funding for transportation projects when municipalities include complete street design features. Assemblymember Fahy led as primary sponsor, joined by Hunter, Seawright, Woerner, and others. The measure sailed through both chambers with strong support. The law aims to shift state dollars toward projects that protect pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders, not just drivers.
