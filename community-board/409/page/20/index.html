Over 400 injured.</strong> That’s just this year in Queens CB9. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement, families left with empty chairs. In the last twelve months, five people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Eleven have died since 2022. The dead do not get second chances.</p><p>Last month, a sedan struck a pedestrian on 131st Street. In June, another walker was hit at 101st Avenue and 116th Street. The pattern does not break. It only repeats. <strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage</strong>—five killed, hundreds hurt. Trucks turned, sedans sped, and people bled. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes all the same.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Some leaders act. <strong>Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called the carnage what it is: &ldquo;traffic violence,&rdquo;</strong> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/02/23/dot-commish-promises-safety-improvements-at-queens-intersection-where-pedestrian-was-run-over-three-times>demanded the city take control of speed limits and cameras</a>. <strong>State Senator Joe Addabbo <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a></strong>—a move that protects children at the curb. These are steps, not solutions. The blood still runs.</p><p>But not all stand with the vulnerable. <strong>Council Member Joann Ariola <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>voted against expanding speed cameras</a></strong>. She called them a burden, even as her own car racked up 27 school zone speeding tickets. The cameras work. The votes say who matters.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made upstream. Lower the speed limit. Expand cameras. Take the keys from repeat offenders. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call until the killing stops.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;I wish they would never have given him that car. I wish they would never think about giving him that car—because if they didn&rsquo;t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>said Keisha Francis</a>, after her 14-year-old was killed by an unlicensed teen driver.

The move aims to connect southeast Queens, cut car trips, and open new routes. The bill signals urgency but lacks binding power. Debate continues over transit versus parkland.</p><p class=mb3>On November 28, 2022, Council Members Joann Ariola and Selvena Brooks-Powers introduced a City Council resolution urging the MTA to conduct an environmental impact study for the QueensLink rail reactivation. The bill, non-binding and currently under committee review, seeks to revive 3.5 miles of the former Rockaway Beach Branch, extending the M train from Rego Park to the Rockaways. The matter title calls for 'a deeper study of the QueensLink proposal to reactivate an old rail line.' Ariola and Brooks-Powers, both representing southeastern Queens, argue the project would benefit communities with poor subway access and reduce car dependency. Ariola stated, 'I think it’s necessary and I think that it would really benefit the communities.' Brooks-Powers emphasized the resolution as a priority for the Transportation Committee. The push comes as Mayor Adams advances the QueensWay park plan, raising concerns among transit advocates. The MTA says a new study is unnecessary, but supporters insist a thorough review is needed before converting the corridor to parkland.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The FDNY supported four out of five bills, including bans on second-use and non-certified batteries, a public safety campaign, and safety information for delivery workers. The FDNY expressed concern about resource demands for detailed annual fire reporting. The matter summary states the bills aim to address the rise of deadly fires from faulty batteries, often used by delivery workers. Council Member Joann Ariola urged the FDNY to consider international solutions and invest in safe charging infrastructure. Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas Unidos opposed the bans, arguing they punish low-income workers and miss root causes. The city recently abandoned a proposal to ban e-bikes on NYCHA property and is working on new charging stations. The debate highlights the struggle to protect vulnerable workers while preventing more deaths and injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
