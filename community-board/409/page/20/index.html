Sixteen left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> This is Queens CB9 since 2022. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on Woodhaven Boulevard, Atlantic Avenue, and Jamaica Avenue—lives ended or broken by cars, trucks, and SUVs. In the past year alone, two people died and five were seriously hurt. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p>Last spring, a 63-year-old woman was crushed by a dump truck turning at Atlantic and Woodhaven. She was working in the street. The truck kept going. The city called it a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;view obstructed&rdquo; crash</a>. The woman never went home.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-not-just-accidents>The Pattern: Not Just Accidents</h2><p><strong>Most deaths here are not random. They follow the same script.</strong> A driver turns. A pedestrian crosses. A truck blocks the view. Someone dies. In March, a 47-year-old man was killed crossing 101st Avenue with the signal. The driver was distracted. The city called it <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;driver inattention&rdquo;</a>.

State Senator Joe Addabbo voted yes to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. But others, like Assembly Member David Weprin, voted no on speed cameras, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>opposing safer school speed zones for children</a>.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.

The move aims to connect southeast Queens, cut car trips, and open new routes. The bill signals urgency but lacks binding power. Debate continues over transit versus parkland.</p><p class=mb3>On November 28, 2022, Council Members Joann Ariola and Selvena Brooks-Powers introduced a City Council resolution urging the MTA to conduct an environmental impact study for the QueensLink rail reactivation. The bill, non-binding and currently under committee review, seeks to revive 3.5 miles of the former Rockaway Beach Branch, extending the M train from Rego Park to the Rockaways. The matter title calls for 'a deeper study of the QueensLink proposal to reactivate an old rail line.' Ariola and Brooks-Powers, both representing southeastern Queens, argue the project would benefit communities with poor subway access and reduce car dependency. Ariola stated, 'I think it’s necessary and I think that it would really benefit the communities.' Brooks-Powers emphasized the resolution as a priority for the Transportation Committee. The push comes as Mayor Adams advances the QueensWay park plan, raising concerns among transit advocates. The MTA says a new study is unnecessary, but supporters insist a thorough review is needed before converting the corridor to parkland.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The FDNY supported four out of five bills, including bans on second-use and non-certified batteries, a public safety campaign, and safety information for delivery workers. The FDNY expressed concern about resource demands for detailed annual fire reporting. The matter summary states the bills aim to address the rise of deadly fires from faulty batteries, often used by delivery workers. Council Member Joann Ariola urged the FDNY to consider international solutions and invest in safe charging infrastructure. Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas Unidos opposed the bans, arguing they punish low-income workers and miss root causes. The city recently abandoned a proposal to ban e-bikes on NYCHA property and is working on new charging stations. The debate highlights the struggle to protect vulnerable workers while preventing more deaths and injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The discussion, reported by nypost.com, focused on rising fire deaths and slower FDNY response times. The matter summary reads: 'Rising NYC fire deaths, response times blamed on traffic measures.' Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) argued that open street programs, bike lanes, and traffic islands hinder emergency vehicles, especially when illegal parking blocks access. She called for better enforcement. Other voices, including union leaders, echoed her concerns. However, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan defended new street designs, stating they were built with emergency input. The Department of Transportation said all projects include emergency routes and are monitored. FDNY officials attributed delays to increased post-pandemic traffic, not street safety measures.

The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
