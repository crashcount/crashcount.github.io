Over 550 injured. Three left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Queens Community Board 9 in the last year alone, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The names are not here. But the numbers are. They do not flinch.</p><h2 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h2><p>A man in his 50s lies in a hospital bed, fighting for his life after a black SUV struck him and kept going. It happened just before midnight on 101st Avenue in Ozone Park. The driver did not stop. The man was found unresponsive on the road. He is not a statistic to his family. But to the city, he is one more number in a long line, as <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>reported by ABC7</a>.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, a van driver lost control and killed Zhihong Shi, 31, as he exited a double-parked car. Two others were hurt. The van driver had a medical episode. The street did not forgive the mistake. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Shi and the other victims, ages 67 and 48, were all rushed to Jamaica Hospital, but Shi could not be saved.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They have power.

The city can set speed limits lower, thanks to Sammy’s Law. But the pace is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. Cameras need reauthorization. The city can lower speeds to 20 mph but has not done so citywide.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city can act. The council can act. Albany can act. But the dead cannot wait. The injured cannot wait. The families cannot wait.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, covered by nypost.com, followed a fatal stabbing and NYPD data showing felony assaults up 9% this year. Ariola warned, 'Forcing more New Yorkers underground with this ridiculous congestion pricing scheme is going to put more people into contact with the dangerously unwell.' She called the subway the city's 'de facto mental institution and homeless shelter.' The policy, supported by Governor Hochul, has increased subway and bus ridership by 6% and 9%. Ariola’s stance: congestion pricing endangers vulnerable riders, forcing them into unsafe conditions. The city has responded with more police and outreach, but many riders remain fearful.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Queens DA Melinda Katz said, 'Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes.' Rosen surrendered at the 112th Precinct and was arraigned. No council members are involved; this is a criminal prosecution, not legislation.

The NYPD's Highway District Collision Investigation Squad is handling the case, and no arrests have been made. The article highlights the crash location—westbound Belt Parkway, just west of 130th Street—and notes the ongoing investigation. The incident underscores the dangers present on high-speed parkways and the unforgiving design of tree-lined medians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors allege Peña was drunk, high, and speeding at 83 mph—three times the limit—when he ran a red light and T-boned 23-year-old Justin Diaz’s car. Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield.
