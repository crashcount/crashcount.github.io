FDNY supports bans on unsafe batteries and calls for more safety info. Advocates warn bans hit low-income delivery workers. Debate rages as fires, injuries, and deaths mount. City eyes safer charging.</p><p class=mb3>On November 14, 2022, the City Council held a hearing on a package of bills addressing lithium-ion battery fires. The FDNY supported four out of five bills, including bans on second-use and non-certified batteries, a public safety campaign, and safety information for delivery workers. The FDNY expressed concern about resource demands for detailed annual fire reporting. The matter summary states the bills aim to address the rise of deadly fires from faulty batteries, often used by delivery workers. Council Member Joann Ariola urged the FDNY to consider international solutions and invest in safe charging infrastructure. Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas Unidos opposed the bans, arguing they punish low-income workers and miss root causes. The city recently abandoned a proposal to ban e-bikes on NYCHA property and is working on new charging stations. The debate highlights the struggle to protect vulnerable workers while preventing more deaths and injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The discussion, reported by nypost.com, focused on rising fire deaths and slower FDNY response times. The matter summary reads: 'Rising NYC fire deaths, response times blamed on traffic measures.' Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) argued that open street programs, bike lanes, and traffic islands hinder emergency vehicles, especially when illegal parking blocks access. She called for better enforcement. Other voices, including union leaders, echoed her concerns. However, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan defended new street designs, stating they were built with emergency input. The Department of Transportation said all projects include emergency routes and are monitored. FDNY officials attributed delays to increased post-pandemic traffic, not street safety measures. The debate highlights the ongoing conflict between car-free streets for vulnerable users and emergency vehicle access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets remain dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On October 21, 2022, police in Bay Ridge arrested Ibrahim Chaaban for reckless driving after he performed donuts on Shore Road. The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
