But to the city, he is one more number in a long line, as <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>reported by ABC7</a>.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, a van driver lost control and killed Zhihong Shi, 31, as he exited a double-parked car. Two others were hurt. The van driver had a medical episode. The street did not forgive the mistake. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Shi and the other victims, ages 67 and 48, were all rushed to Jamaica Hospital, but Shi could not be saved.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.

The city’s most vulnerable face the risk underground.</p><p class=mb3>On April 26, 2025, City Council Minority Leader Joann Ariola (District 32) publicly criticized New York’s congestion pricing policy, linking it to rising subway assaults. The event, covered by nypost.com, followed a fatal stabbing and NYPD data showing felony assaults up 9% this year. Ariola warned, 'Forcing more New Yorkers underground with this ridiculous congestion pricing scheme is going to put more people into contact with the dangerously unwell.' She called the subway the city's 'de facto mental institution and homeless shelter.' The policy, supported by Governor Hochul, has increased subway and bus ridership by 6% and 9%. Ariola’s stance: congestion pricing endangers vulnerable riders, forcing them into unsafe conditions. The city has responded with more police and outreach, but many riders remain fearful.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
