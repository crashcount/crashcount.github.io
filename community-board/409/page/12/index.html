Sixteen left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> This is Queens CB9 since 2022. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on Woodhaven Boulevard, Atlantic Avenue, and Jamaica Avenue—lives ended or broken by cars, trucks, and SUVs. In the past year alone, two people died and five were seriously hurt. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p>Last spring, a 63-year-old woman was crushed by a dump truck turning at Atlantic and Woodhaven. She was working in the street. The truck kept going. The city called it a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;view obstructed&rdquo; crash</a>. The woman never went home.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-not-just-accidents>The Pattern: Not Just Accidents</h2><p><strong>Most deaths here are not random. They follow the same script.</strong> A driver turns. A pedestrian crosses. A truck blocks the view. Someone dies. In March, a 47-year-old man was killed crossing 101st Avenue with the signal. The driver was distracted. The city called it <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;driver inattention&rdquo;</a>.

State Senator Joe Addabbo voted yes to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. But others, like Assembly Member David Weprin, voted no on speed cameras, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>opposing safer school speed zones for children</a>.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.

Rajkumar, a close ally of Mayor Adams, claims e-bikes are a 'singular threat' and a 'safety hazard,' citing injury numbers that city data does not support. She stated, 'We have to get rid of the e-bike problem.' Despite her focus on e-bikes, a car used by Rajkumar’s office received 10 school-zone speeding tickets in under a year. Her spokesperson denied she drives the car, later confirmed to belong to her chief of staff. Rajkumar declined further comment.
