Two others were hurt. The van driver had a medical episode. The street did not forgive the mistake. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Shi and the other victims, ages 67 and 48, were all rushed to Jamaica Hospital, but Shi could not be saved.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.

The city can set speed limits lower, thanks to Sammy’s Law. But the pace is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. Cameras need reauthorization.

High-crash intersections must be prioritized unless deemed infeasible. DOT must also install physical daylighting features, such as planters or bike corrals, where possible. Council Member Farah N.

The committee urged the Department of Transportation to study sidewalk widening, safer crossings, outdoor seating, and even pedestrianizing segments of the street. The matter title reads: 'Austin Street in Forest Hills should be transformed into a pedestrian paradise instead of the car-choked, will-sapping roadway it is today.' Pedro Rodriguez, a local advocate, pressed for urgent action, citing ongoing injuries and business impacts. Council Member Lynn Schulman did not comment. DOT spokesperson Vin Barone welcomed the board's support for Vision Zero and promised further discussions. From January 2018 to November 2022, 356 crashes caused 80 injuries on this stretch—most to pedestrians and cyclists. The board’s push aims to end the violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
