Over 550 injured. Three left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Queens Community Board 9 in the last year alone, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The names are not here. But the numbers are. They do not flinch.</p><h2 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h2><p>A man in his 50s lies in a hospital bed, fighting for his life after a black SUV struck him and kept going. It happened just before midnight on 101st Avenue in Ozone Park. The driver did not stop. The man was found unresponsive on the road. He is not a statistic to his family. But to the city, he is one more number in a long line, as <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>reported by ABC7</a>.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, a van driver lost control and killed Zhihong Shi, 31, as he exited a double-parked car. Two others were hurt. The van driver had a medical episode. The street did not forgive the mistake. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Shi and the other victims, ages 67 and 48, were all rushed to Jamaica Hospital, but Shi could not be saved.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They have power.

The city can set speed limits lower, thanks to Sammy’s Law. But the pace is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. Cameras need reauthorization. The city can lower speeds to 20 mph but has not done so citywide.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city can act. The council can act. Albany can act. But the dead cannot wait. The injured cannot wait. The families cannot wait.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mendez-Vasquez, initially charged with criminally negligent homicide, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless driving and received probation. The DA’s office cited the family’s wishes, but advocates and family friends called the outcome a slap on the wrist. The crash sparked local activism: the community board passed a resolution for universal daylighting—removing parked cars from corners to improve visibility. Mayor Adams pledged to daylight 1,000 intersections a year, but the Department of Transportation has resisted full implementation, citing concerns about driver behavior. The city installed a traffic signal and banned parking at two corners, but systemic danger remains. The case highlights how lenient prosecution and slow policy change leave vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case, filed in Manhattan, challenges the environmental review process and seeks to block the $15 daily toll for cars entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The lawsuit claims, 'the city, state, and federal government did not do the proper review to protect citizens.' Council Member Bob Holden called the charge 'insane.' The MTA defends its review and says delays threaten $15 billion in transit upgrades. Transit advocates say the lawsuit is frivolous and congestion pricing’s benefits are clear.

The matter summary reads: 'Lower East Side residents sue MTA over $15 congestion toll, claiming it will create a traffic nightmare.' Holden’s involvement signals council opposition.
