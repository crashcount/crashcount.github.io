Over 400 injured.</strong> That’s just this year in Queens CB9. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement, families left with empty chairs. In the last twelve months, five people suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Eleven have died since 2022. The dead do not get second chances.</p><p>Last month, a sedan struck a pedestrian on 131st Street. In June, another walker was hit at 101st Avenue and 116th Street. The pattern does not break. It only repeats. <strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage</strong>—five killed, hundreds hurt. Trucks turned, sedans sped, and people bled. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes all the same.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Some leaders act. <strong>Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called the carnage what it is: &ldquo;traffic violence,&rdquo;</strong> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/02/23/dot-commish-promises-safety-improvements-at-queens-intersection-where-pedestrian-was-run-over-three-times>demanded the city take control of speed limits and cameras</a>. <strong>State Senator Joe Addabbo <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a></strong>—a move that protects children at the curb. These are steps, not solutions. The blood still runs.</p><p>But not all stand with the vulnerable. <strong>Council Member Joann Ariola <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>voted against expanding speed cameras</a></strong>. She called them a burden, even as her own car racked up 27 school zone speeding tickets. The cameras work. The votes say who matters.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made upstream. Lower the speed limit. Expand cameras. Take the keys from repeat offenders. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call until the killing stops.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;I wish they would never have given him that car. I wish they would never think about giving him that car—because if they didn&rsquo;t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>said Keisha Francis</a>, after her 14-year-old was killed by an unlicensed teen driver.

Prosecutors say Rosen pursued William McField, a 55-year-old motorcyclist, after a minor collision. On Woodhaven Boulevard, Rosen struck McField from behind, ran him over, and continued driving, dragging the motorcycle until it caught fire. Rosen then hit another car before stopping at a lamp post. McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes."

Rahimi, the driver, said, "We were driving right off here. Something fell off the train, damaging the windshield." Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
