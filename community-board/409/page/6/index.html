But to the city, he is one more number in a long line, as <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>reported by ABC7</a>.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, a van driver lost control and killed Zhihong Shi, 31, as he exited a double-parked car. Two others were hurt. The van driver had a medical episode. The street did not forgive the mistake. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Shi and the other victims, ages 67 and 48, were all rushed to Jamaica Hospital, but Shi could not be saved.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They have power.

The city can set speed limits lower, thanks to Sammy’s Law. But the pace is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. Cameras need reauthorization. The city can lower speeds to 20 mph but has not done so citywide.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city can act.

Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on.

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the department of transportation posting information on traffic-control device and speed reducer requests on its website.” Council Member Kalman Yeger led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law orders DOT to publish every request for traffic signals and speed humps—case number, subject, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial, and timeline if approved. The public can now track what the city does, or fails to do, when streets need taming.

The pedestrian was crossing at a marked crosswalk without a crossing signal when a 2024 Kia sedan, driven by a licensed male driver, made a right turn and failed to yield the right-of-way. This driver error is cited twice as the contributing factor. The pedestrian sustained fractures and dislocations to her knee, lower leg, and foot, classified as injury severity level 3. The vehicle showed no damage, indicating the impact was likely at low speed but sufficient to cause serious injury. The report explicitly identifies the driver’s failure to yield as the cause, with no contributing factors attributed to the pedestrian.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
