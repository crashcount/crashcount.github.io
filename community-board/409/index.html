Eleven dead. Nineteen left with wounds that will never heal.</strong> In Queens CB9, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have hit and killed 11 people. Nineteen more were left with serious injuries. The pain is not spread evenly. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street.</p><p>Just this June, a 66-year-old man was killed at the corner of 116th Street and 101st Avenue. In March, two men—one 67, one 31—were struck and killed on Atlantic Avenue. The street does not care about age. It does not care about time of day. It only takes.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A brother stands at the curb, staring at the spot where his sibling died. “He was always happy. He would make you happy. He would make happy any person in the world,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>said Avelardo Venancio</a>. The grief is raw. The loss is permanent.</p><p>A witness, still shaken, remembers the moment. “Must have been going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams and just dropped everything and ran over there, it was instant,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>said George Giakoumis</a>.</p><p><strong>Speed is the weapon.

State Senator Joe Addabbo voted yes to extend school speed zones and to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed-limiting devices. Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called out the crisis as &ldquo;traffic violence&rdquo; and demanded stronger city control over speed limits and cameras. But others drag their feet or vote no. Each delay is another risk, another life in the balance.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day someone else may die. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The original proposal called for 2,775 homes and limited parking. Now, density drops by 27 percent. Empire State Development claims compromise, but the statement is aspirational and lacks concrete safety measures for pedestrians or cyclists. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.

The teen, unlicensed and speeding at over 100 mph in a 30-mph zone, lost control and struck a parked UPS truck. Prosecutors said he only had a learner's permit and had been previously ticketed for unlicensed driving. His parents, who gave him the BMW, were convicted of child endangerment. DA Melinda Katz called it 'a landmark case where both an unlicensed teenage driver and his parents were held responsible.'

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...exempting ambulettes from certain bus lane restrictions and allowing them to double park to assist passengers,' would let ambulettes drive, stop, and double-park in bus lanes to help passengers. Council Member Julie Menin sponsors, joined by Linda Lee, Frank Morano, Eric Dinowitz, Lynn C. Schulman, Kamillah Hanks, Carlina Rivera, and Chris Banks. Allowing more vehicles to double-park and block bus lanes increases risk for pedestrians and cyclists at the curb. The city’s most vulnerable will face more conflict and less safe space.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
