The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users.

The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes.

Jessica Ramos led a rally, citing 'reckless drivers who refuse to yield to pedestrians' and called for stronger pedestrian safety, saying, 'driving is a privilege that can, and should be, taken away.' Adam White, a lawyer for crash victims, said the DA should have insisted Barcia not drive. The rally highlighted rising road deaths—48 killed citywide in early 2024—and called out the city’s failure to protect its most vulnerable.

The driver, Jose Barcia, rushed a left turn from 31st Avenue and struck the children, according to NYPD Chief of Transportation Philip Rivera. Barcia faces charges of criminally negligent homicide, failure to yield, failure to exercise due care, and speeding. State Senator Jessica Ramos responded, calling for passage of 'Sammy's Law' to let the city set its own speed limits. Ramos said, 'I fight so hard for improved public transit because there are too many cars on the road, particularly SUVs and pickup trucks that do not allow for full visibility in city streets.' She urged fewer cars, especially large vehicles, and stressed the need for pedestrian safety in the budget. 31st Avenue, where the crash happened, saw 74 crashes and 47 injuries last year, far more than nearby, mostly car-free 34th Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
