The matter, titled 'The City Needs a Systemic Fix, Justice for Workers and Accountability by Tech Giants,' exposes how delivery workers, squeezed by low pay and unsafe roads, turn to illegal mopeds. Council Member Alexa Aviles demanded rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and resources for workers. State Sen. Jessica Ramos blamed app companies for shifting costs onto underpaid deliveristas. Advocacy leaders like Carl Mahaney rejected crackdowns, calling for dedicated space instead. Jon Orcutt criticized City Hall’s blindspot on traffic rules. The debate centered on expanding bike lanes, building charging infrastructure, holding tech companies accountable, and buyback programs for unsafe batteries.
