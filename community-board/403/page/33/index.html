An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

This follows a state bill signed last year mandating better conditions for cyclists. The plan, still in development, aims to create 'equitable access to the transit system and support sustainable transportation modes.' MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber said, 'We want to improve customer access to our environmentally friendly MTA services, however they get to their train or bus.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas called bridge access 'a matter of environmental justice, public health, and labor justice.' The MTA has ended bike permits on LIRR and Metro-North and added bike parking at Grand Central, but its record on bike access remains mixed. The agency is now seeking public comment and has hired Sam Schwartz Engineering to help shape the plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
