An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure.

Two Mercedes passengers were hospitalized. The article notes, 'The FDNY stated Pena will be suspended without pay for 28 days during the investigation.' Video evidence indicated Diaz entered the intersection legally, with the pedestrian signal allowing crossing. The incident highlights the lethal risk of speeding and red-light running, even in early morning hours.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill summary reads: 'Provides a fare-free bus pilot program in New York City for one year, subject to appropriations.' Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani (District 36, primary sponsor) and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas (District 34, co-sponsor) lead the charge. The measure was introduced on February 26, 2025. No safety analyst has assessed the bill's impact on vulnerable road users. The pilot aims to change how New Yorkers move, but its effect on street safety remains unstudied.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
