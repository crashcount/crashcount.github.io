An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived.

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment.

Surveillance video captured Pena’s Mercedes “passing a red light on Northern Boulevard and T-boning Diaz’s 2022 BMW.” Diaz, 23, died at Elmhurst Hospital. Pena faces charges of vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to take a breath test. Two passengers in Pena’s car were hospitalized. The FDNY suspended Pena for 28 days without pay.

The impact was severe enough that a parked Toyota SUV was also damaged. The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'Metal screamed. A parked Toyota caught the edge. The street fell silent.'
