Streets once safe for walkers and riders now risk return to cars. The future is uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2025, New York City’s Open Streets program entered crisis. The program, legislated by the City Council, lost its federal Covid funding. Mayor Adams has not allocated city funds. The Department of Transportation (DOT) says $5 million is needed to maintain current operations, but the Council’s preliminary budget omits this. DOT Chief of Staff Ryan Lynch told advocates the agency is lobbying for replacement funds. Council Member Shekar Krishnan criticized the mayor’s stance, saying, “It’s deeply misguided to cut funds from the open street program, especially at this moment.” The City Comptroller’s office also faulted the administration for poor planning. The funding gap has already led to reduced hours and fewer open streets. Council members are pushing for restoration, but the program’s future hangs in the balance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
