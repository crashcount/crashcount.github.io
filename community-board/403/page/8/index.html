An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

The matter summary reads: 'NYC mayoral candidates participated in a transit-focused forum... discussing congestion pricing, subway safety, and transit upgrades.' Zellnor Myrie, representing District 20, criticized Mayor Adams for not defending congestion pricing and promised to support it regardless of federal politics. Ramos pushed for congestion pricing revenue to fund the MTA. Stringer called for bus expansion and DOT reform. Walden wanted more police and exemptions for seniors and disabled riders.

Two bicyclists, both 42-year-old men, were involved. Both were ejected from the bicycle and suffered head injuries classified as injury severity level 3. Both wore helmets, as noted in the report, but still sustained significant trauma. The police report does not list any contributing factors or driver errors, nor does it indicate involvement of other vehicles. The bicycle was traveling west, going straight ahead, with no damage reported to the vehicle. The absence of cited driver errors or other vehicles suggests the crash circumstances remain unclear, but the impact was severe enough to cause ejection and serious injury to both riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The discussion, reported in the New York Post, centered on Trump’s opposition to congestion pricing and promises to improve Penn Station and the subways. State Senator Jessica Ramos, mentioned in the debate, voiced skepticism: 'If he’s saying he’s going to do it, he better deliver.' Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis urged collaboration with Trump and federal funding for infrastructure, rejecting congestion pricing. Mayor Eric Adams said he contacted Trump about city infrastructure needs. The matter title reads: 'What lefty leaders need to do to make NY great again after Trump’s victory, pols and pundits reveal.' No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The debate leaves the city’s most at-risk—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—waiting for action, not promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states he was 'ejected' and suffered 'severe lacerations' to the head after falling from the moving vehicle. The narrative details: 'A 47-year-old man clung to the outside of a dump truck. No belt. No shield. He fell. Skull met asphalt. Blood pooled. The truck rolled on, untouched. The man did not.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.'
