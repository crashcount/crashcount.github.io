An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

No daylighting near schools. No lower bike lane speed limits. No new e-bike rules. City and state leaders bickered. Streets stay dangerous. Pedestrians and cyclists remain exposed. The system failed them again.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, during New York State’s $254-million budget negotiations, lawmakers rejected Governor Hochul’s proposed street safety measures. The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, featured Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Whitney Tilson. Stringer demanded 'massive expansion of protected bike lanes.' Myrie backed S1047, a bill for 50-percent e-bike rebates. Ramos called for safe bike lanes and clear signage for all riders. Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, featured Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Whitney Tilson. Stringer pledged to move the city away from car dependence and build infrastructure for biking and transit. Myrie called for removing parking mandates to boost housing and speed up buses. Ramos supported repurposing parking for safer streets and green space. Lander pushed for eliminating parking minimums citywide and dynamic curbside management. Mamdani criticized the vast space given to cars. Only Tilson promised to preserve free street parking. The candidates’ stances show a clear divide: most want to reclaim streets for people, not vehicles.

Scott Stringer said, 'The best way to curtail reckless driving is to make less room for reckless drivers on the road.' Zellnor Myrie promised 'physically separated bus lanes' and expanded automated enforcement. Jessica Ramos called for 'a citywide strategy that prioritizes safety through design.' Zohran Mamdani wants to move traffic enforcement from NYPD to DOT, ending biased stops. Whitney Tilson supports more police and cameras. The candidates back protected bike lanes, busways, daylighting, and automated enforcement. Their plans center on street redesign and accountability, not blaming victims.

The bill’s fate now rests with the next mayor, as Adams’s plan delays long-term decisions. The City Council, led by Parks Committee Chair Shekar Krishnan, urges Adams to secure the program’s future, warning, "future mayors don’t inherit a decimated program." Comptroller Brad Lander and several Democratic mayoral candidates support expansion. Ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a leading candidate, offers only a case-by-case review. Advocates and organizers say the current funding is inadequate, calling it a "token show of support" and demanding $48 million over three years.
