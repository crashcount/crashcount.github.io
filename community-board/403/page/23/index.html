He promises green space and bike lanes. Renderings show paths, but crossing the Grand Central Parkway stays deadly. Locals want safer streets, not slots. Lawmakers push for community input. The fight for access continues.</p><p class=mb3>Billionaire Mets owner Steve Cohen has proposed a major redevelopment of the Citi Field parking lot, including a Hard Rock casino, public park, plaza, bike lanes, and a renovated train station. The plan, called 'Metropolitan Park,' was unveiled on November 7, 2023. Assembly Member Jeffrey Aubrion introduced a bill to enable construction by 'alienating' parkland, but State Sen. Jessica Ramos, the local representative, remains skeptical. Ramos said, 'I didn't think a casino is necessary to redevelop the parking lot or create a safer pathway from 34th Street to the baseball stadium,' and stressed the need for community input: 'It's important that my neighbors look carefully at the proposal and we'll continue together with our process.' Public visioning sessions showed residents want better bike and transit connections, not gambling. The proposal highlights new bike lanes on Roosevelt Avenue and Boat Basin Place, but fails to address the hazardous crossing at Grand Central Parkway for cyclists and pedestrians. Details on funding and implementation remain unclear.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
