An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

The plan, described as 'bold,' creates a 1.3-mile stretch where vehicles are guests on shared streets, with two blocks and five half-blocks fully pedestrianized. Councilmember Shekar Krishnan, who campaigned for this change, voiced strong support: 'This design improves pedestrian safety and expands accessibility for all people.' DOT officials committed to ongoing collaboration. Some Community Board 3 leaders raised concerns about transparency, scooters, disability access, and environmental review, but DOT called these minor and solvable. The plan has broad support from local advocates and is set to begin implementation in June, with more improvements in 2023. The move marks a major shift for Jackson Heights, prioritizing people over cars and setting a new standard for city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began. The mayor’s proposed $98.5-billion budget did not allocate significant funds for the plan.

Riders in transit deserts face long waits, missed trains, and crowded platforms. The resolution highlights gaps in service that strand working New Yorkers far from Manhattan.</p><p class=mb3>Res 0110-2022 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution, introduced April 14, 2022, and filed at session's end on December 31, 2023, urges the MTA to 'adjust schedules for distant subway terminal lines to include more peak-direction rush hour trains for commuters to travel to central economic hubs.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Bottcher, and others. The bill responds to service gaps hitting outer boroughs, end-of-line stations, and transit deserts—areas where 600,000 New Yorkers live with poor transit access. The council points to pandemic-era staffing shortages and train cancellations that left riders stranded. The measure aims to push the MTA to close these gaps and connect more New Yorkers to jobs and opportunity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to limit the sidewalk area that residential or commercial property owners must maintain to thirty feet from the property line. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to limiting the amount of sidewalk area that private property owners are responsible for maintaining.' Council Members Robert F. Holden (primary sponsor), Kalman Yeger, and Francisco P. Moya backed the bill. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage. The bill would have shifted some sidewalk responsibility away from private owners, but left gaps in accountability. The city retains liability for areas beyond the thirty-foot limit, but the fractured system remains. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, wheelchair users—still face hazards from uneven, neglected sidewalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a 'broken promise and failure of the prior administration,' centers on the city’s failure to ban cars from the full length of 78th Street between 34th Avenue and Northern Boulevard. Council Member Shekar Krishnan led the charge, criticizing the city for allowing Koeppel Mazda to use park space as a service entrance. Krishnan called this 'offensive to the notion of parks equity' and demanded urgent action to remove car access. Parks Commissioner Susan Donoghue acknowledged the issue and committed to working with DOT and City Hall to resolve it. The push aims to reclaim public space for pedestrians and children, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
