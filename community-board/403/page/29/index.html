The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began. The mayor’s proposed $98.5-billion budget did not allocate significant funds for the plan. Advocates say the city must act now to stem the bloodshed on its streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders in transit deserts face long waits, missed trains, and crowded platforms. The resolution highlights gaps in service that strand working New Yorkers far from Manhattan.</p><p class=mb3>Res 0110-2022 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution, introduced April 14, 2022, and filed at session's end on December 31, 2023, urges the MTA to 'adjust schedules for distant subway terminal lines to include more peak-direction rush hour trains for commuters to travel to central economic hubs.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Bottcher, and others. The bill responds to service gaps hitting outer boroughs, end-of-line stations, and transit deserts—areas where 600,000 New Yorkers live with poor transit access. The council points to pandemic-era staffing shortages and train cancellations that left riders stranded. The measure aims to push the MTA to close these gaps and connect more New Yorkers to jobs and opportunity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to limit the sidewalk area that residential or commercial property owners must maintain to thirty feet from the property line. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to limiting the amount of sidewalk area that private property owners are responsible for maintaining.' Council Members Robert F. Holden (primary sponsor), Kalman Yeger, and Francisco P. Moya backed the bill. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage. The bill would have shifted some sidewalk responsibility away from private owners, but left gaps in accountability. The city retains liability for areas beyond the thirty-foot limit, but the fractured system remains. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, wheelchair users—still face hazards from uneven, neglected sidewalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a 'broken promise and failure of the prior administration,' centers on the city’s failure to ban cars from the full length of 78th Street between 34th Avenue and Northern Boulevard. Council Member Shekar Krishnan led the charge, criticizing the city for allowing Koeppel Mazda to use park space as a service entrance. Krishnan called this 'offensive to the notion of parks equity' and demanded urgent action to remove car access. Parks Commissioner Susan Donoghue acknowledged the issue and committed to working with DOT and City Hall to resolve it. The push aims to reclaim public space for pedestrians and children, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight for safer, fairer transit rolls on.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, discussed on February 25, 2022, centers on the push for free bus service in New York City. The matter, titled 'Is It Time For Free Buses In New York City?', highlights calls from TWU Local 100 Vice-President JP Patafio and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas to end fare enforcement and make buses free. Patafio said, 'They should look at making local bus service free. As we saw during the pandemic, it's an essential public service.' González-Rojas argued that free buses sped up service and helped riders during the pandemic. She is working on proposals to boost MTA funding and pilot free lines. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber pushed back, citing a $2B-plus deficit and stressing the need for faster, more reliable buses. Advocates and officials agree: bus improvements and fare-free service are not mutually exclusive. The debate continues in committee, with no formal bill yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The visit drew Council Member Shekar Krishnan, who lobbied Adams to convert the street into a permanent, car-free linear park. Krishnan said, 'I advocated for a linear park and how transformative it would be for our city.' Despite Adams’ past support—he once signed a petition for the park—he made no commitments during the visit. Funding for the conversion and for Citi Bike expansion was left out of the Department of Transportation budget. DOT and City Hall offered no clear answers on future plans or funding. The future of 34th Avenue’s open street remains uncertain, leaving vulnerable road users waiting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
