Krishnan said, “The infrastructure projects, the transportation and green space projects, need to be progressing at a much much faster rate.” The legislation responds to years-long delays on vital bike and pedestrian greenways, like Ocean Parkway, where repairs have lagged since 2019. Parks officials blame pandemic pauses and contractor reviews. The bills aim to end the cycle of neglect that leaves vulnerable road users at risk on crumbling paths.

The fight moves to City Planning.</p><p class=mb3>On November 7, 2022, Queens Community Board 2 passed a resolution rejecting a rezoning application for a Lincoln SUV dealership on Northern Boulevard, Woodside. The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The discussion, reported by nypost.com, focused on rising fire deaths and slower FDNY response times. The matter summary reads: 'Rising NYC fire deaths, response times blamed on traffic measures.' Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) argued that open street programs, bike lanes, and traffic islands hinder emergency vehicles, especially when illegal parking blocks access. She called for better enforcement. Other voices, including union leaders, echoed her concerns. However, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan defended new street designs, stating they were built with emergency input. The Department of Transportation said all projects include emergency routes and are monitored. FDNY officials attributed delays to increased post-pandemic traffic, not street safety measures.
