State Senator Zellnor Myrie, representing District 20, called for a dedicated busway on Brooklyn's Flatbush Avenue, echoing the success of Manhattan's 14th Street. The forum, hosted by Riders Alliance, saw candidates—including Myrie, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, and Jim Walden—debate urgent transit reforms. The matter: 'improving NYC's slow bus service.' Myrie and others backed more bus lanes, fare-free buses, and expanding Fair Fares for low-income riders. Mamdani vowed not to cave to local opposition. All criticized Mayor Adams for stalled bus projects.

The Council may weaken the plan by creating a three-tiered system, risking fewer new homes. Mayoral challengers Zellnor Myrie, Brad Lander, Scott Stringer, Jessica Ramos, and Zohran Mamdani—all Democrats—strongly support the original plan. Myrie urges, 'resist efforts to revise the proposal in any way that would yield fewer homes.' Lander calls for ending exclusionary zoning and prioritizing housing over parking. Stringer calls the plan a 'small step.' Mamdani opposes changes that reduce housing or water down parking elimination. Ramos would vote yes but wants to protect neighborhood character.

Two bicyclists, both 42-year-old men, were involved. Both were ejected from the bicycle and suffered head injuries classified as injury severity level 3. Both wore helmets, as noted in the report, but still sustained significant trauma.

The bicycle was traveling west, going straight ahead, with no damage reported to the vehicle. The absence of cited driver errors or other vehicles suggests the crash circumstances remain unclear, but the impact was severe enough to cause ejection and serious injury to both riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
