An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

The event, organized by Riders Alliance, saw candidates attack Mayor Eric Adams for not meeting the Streets Master Plan law, which mandates 30 new miles of bus lanes each year. Adams’ administration installed only 15.7 miles last fiscal year. State Sen. Jessica Ramos said, 'The current mayor promised 150 miles of bus lanes and hasn't delivered.' Comptroller Brad Lander promised a 'professional, world-class DOT commissioner.' Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani vowed to resist business interests blocking bus projects. Sen. Zellnor Myrie, mentioned at the forum, made pro-transit promises.

The Council may weaken the plan by creating a three-tiered system, risking fewer new homes. Mayoral challengers Zellnor Myrie, Brad Lander, Scott Stringer, Jessica Ramos, and Zohran Mamdani—all Democrats—strongly support the original plan. Myrie urges, 'resist efforts to revise the proposal in any way that would yield fewer homes.' Lander calls for ending exclusionary zoning and prioritizing housing over parking. Stringer calls the plan a 'small step.' Mamdani opposes changes that reduce housing or water down parking elimination. Ramos would vote yes but wants to protect neighborhood character.

Two bicyclists, both 42-year-old men, were involved. Both were ejected from the bicycle and suffered head injuries classified as injury severity level 3. Both wore helmets, as noted in the report, but still sustained significant trauma. The police report does not list any contributing factors or driver errors, nor does it indicate involvement of other vehicles. The bicycle was traveling west, going straight ahead, with no damage reported to the vehicle. The absence of cited driver errors or other vehicles suggests the crash circumstances remain unclear, but the impact was severe enough to cause ejection and serious injury to both riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Leaders call for federal funds, but vulnerable road users remain at risk as politics stall real safety gains.</p><p class=mb3>On November 9, 2024, following the presidential election, New York City leaders debated transportation policy. The discussion, reported in the New York Post, centered on Trump’s opposition to congestion pricing and promises to improve Penn Station and the subways. State Senator Jessica Ramos, mentioned in the debate, voiced skepticism: 'If he’s saying he’s going to do it, he better deliver.' Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis urged collaboration with Trump and federal funding for infrastructure, rejecting congestion pricing. Mayor Eric Adams said he contacted Trump about city infrastructure needs. The matter title reads: 'What lefty leaders need to do to make NY great again after Trump’s victory, pols and pundits reveal.' No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The debate leaves the city’s most at-risk—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—waiting for action, not promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
