An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

Parents begged for help. The city stalled. Jessica Ramos backs a bill for a guard at every school corner. She calls for daylighting, scrambles, and less congestion. The city’s response: not enough. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On September 27, 2024, State Senator Jessica Ramos, representing Queens District 13, called for urgent action after two students were killed in traffic near P.S. 127. The matter, titled 'Queens parents struggle to get crossing guards after 2 students killed in traffic,' highlights a dire shortage: only 1,500 crossing guards citywide, down from 2,600 in 2019. Ramos supports a bill mandating a crossing guard at every school corner and urges investment in pedestrian scrambles, daylighting, and congestion reduction. She said, 'You would think that this is one of the most basic ways to protect the safety of our children. And yet that seems like an insurmountable task.' Ramos’s advocacy comes as parents face bureaucratic stonewalling and city officials offer piecemeal fixes. The city’s measures—stop signs, bollards, and cement blocks—fall short. Ramos demands full funding and systemic change to protect children on their way to school.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

But other bridges still leave vulnerable users stranded. Advocates demand more.</p><p class=mb3>On September 25, 2024, the MTA completed a major upgrade to the Cross Bay Bridge, replacing its hazardous Rockaway-side ramp with a wider, ADA-compliant path. This action fulfills a mandate from the 2021 MTA Bike Access bill. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, who sponsored the law, said, "I'm excited about the ADA-accessible ramp on the Cross Bay Bridge and that cyclists and pedestrians can access this space... because we passed my legislation." The MTA also announced similar improvements for the Henry Hudson and Triboro Bridges. However, plans for the Verrazzano, Gil Hodges-Marine Parkway, Bronx-Whitestone, and Throgs Neck bridges remain uncertain. Cycling advocates praised the MTA’s progress but criticized its reluctance to consider lane conversions for safer, broader access. The new ramp removes a deadly barrier, but the fight for safe passage on all city bridges continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
