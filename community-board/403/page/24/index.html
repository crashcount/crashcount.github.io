An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous. Lawmakers are under pressure to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Over 20 surpass 2019 numbers. Riders are workers, immigrants, people of color. MTA tweaks service—adds some, cuts some. Waits grow. Calls mount for more funding. Riders need frequent trains. Lives depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2023, Comptroller Tom DiNapoli reported that more than 20 New York City subway stations exceeded pre-pandemic ridership in December 2022. The recovery, strongest in outer boroughs and Upper Manhattan, highlights the reliance of working-class, immigrant, and communities of color on transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber said, 'these New Yorkers deserve the same frequent, safe reliable service that they've come to depend on over time.' State Sen. Jessica Ramos, representing the 7 train corridor, demanded state funding for six-minute off-peak service, noting, 'my neighbors are the ones who do work that they can't do from home.' The MTA has made service adjustments—some lines see more weekend trains, but peak service is trimmed, leading to longer waits. As total ridership lags, agency leaders and advocates warn that cuts hit those who need transit most. The fight for reliable, frequent service continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the Council, calls for a 25 percent reduction in capital project durations and greater transparency through improved online tracking. Krishnan said, “The infrastructure projects, the transportation and green space projects, need to be progressing at a much much faster rate.” The bill responds to years-long delays on projects like the Ocean Parkway greenway. Parks officials acknowledge the problem and welcome collaboration. The mayor’s task force also seeks capital process reform, including design-build contracts and standardized approvals. The proposal aims to speed up critical repairs for pedestrians and cyclists, demanding accountability from city agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bills, discussed at an oversight hearing, would force Parks to devise a plan by December 1, 2023, to reduce project durations by 25 percent and improve online transparency about delays and costs. Krishnan said, “The infrastructure projects, the transportation and green space projects, need to be progressing at a much much faster rate.” The legislation responds to years-long delays on vital bike and pedestrian greenways, like Ocean Parkway, where repairs have lagged since 2019. Parks officials blame pandemic pauses and contractor reviews. The bills aim to end the cycle of neglect that leaves vulnerable road users at risk on crumbling paths. Parks spokesperson Meghan Lalor said the agency is open to working with the Council on reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
