An eight-year-old boy was crossing at the intersection with the pedestrian signal when the truck’s right front bumper struck him. The report states the child suffered crush injuries to his entire body and died at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The boy was crossing with the signal, as documented in the report. The driver’s failure to yield during a left turn directly led to the fatal collision.

The avenue is a known danger.</p><p class=mb3>On March 13, 2024, in East Elmhurst, Queens, a pickup truck driver killed 8-year-old Bayron Palomino Arroyo and injured his 10-year-old brother as they crossed 100th Street. The driver, Jose Barcia, rushed a left turn from 31st Avenue and struck the children, according to NYPD Chief of Transportation Philip Rivera. Barcia faces charges of criminally negligent homicide, failure to yield, failure to exercise due care, and speeding. State Senator Jessica Ramos responded, calling for passage of 'Sammy's Law' to let the city set its own speed limits. Ramos said, 'I fight so hard for improved public transit because there are too many cars on the road, particularly SUVs and pickup trucks that do not allow for full visibility in city streets.' She urged fewer cars, especially large vehicles, and stressed the need for pedestrian safety in the budget. 31st Avenue, where the crash happened, saw 74 crashes and 47 injuries last year, far more than nearby, mostly car-free 34th Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
