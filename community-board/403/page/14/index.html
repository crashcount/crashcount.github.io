At arraignment, Barcia was released without surrendering his license. The Queens District Attorney’s office did not seek revocation. State Sen. Jessica Ramos led a rally, citing 'reckless drivers who refuse to yield to pedestrians' and called for stronger pedestrian safety, saying, 'driving is a privilege that can, and should be, taken away.' Adam White, a lawyer for crash victims, said the DA should have insisted Barcia not drive. The rally highlighted rising road deaths—48 killed citywide in early 2024—and called out the city’s failure to protect its most vulnerable.

The driver, Jose Barcia, rushed a left turn from 31st Avenue and struck the children, according to NYPD Chief of Transportation Philip Rivera. Barcia faces charges of criminally negligent homicide, failure to yield, failure to exercise due care, and speeding. State Senator Jessica Ramos responded, calling for passage of 'Sammy's Law' to let the city set its own speed limits. Ramos said, 'I fight so hard for improved public transit because there are too many cars on the road, particularly SUVs and pickup trucks that do not allow for full visibility in city streets.' She urged fewer cars, especially large vehicles, and stressed the need for pedestrian safety in the budget. 31st Avenue, where the crash happened, saw 74 crashes and 47 injuries last year, far more than nearby, mostly car-free 34th Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of bollards at reconstructed sidewalks, curb extensions and pedestrian ramps.” Council Members Shekar Krishnan (primary sponsor), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Shahana K. Hanif, and Crystal Hudson back the measure. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install bollards where sidewalks, curb extensions, and pedestrian ramps are rebuilt for accessibility. It also mandates a study on bollard effectiveness in high pedestrian traffic areas and demands new installation guidelines within six months. The bill aims to shield vulnerable pedestrians, especially those with disabilities, from vehicle intrusion at rebuilt crossings. As of June 25, 2024, the committee has not advanced the bill.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill's title reads: "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting dynamic pricing under the city’s bike share program." Council Member Lincoln Restler is the primary sponsor, joined by Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, and Francisco P. Moya. Their action: sponsorship and referral to committee. The bill would stop the Department of Transportation from allowing dynamic pricing—defined as any fee increase based on demand—in the Citi Bike program. The goal: keep bike share affordable and predictable for all riders, especially those who rely on it most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It requires the Department of Transportation, or any relevant agency, to notify and allow comments from council members, community boards, and business improvement districts before removing a vehicular lane or parking for 500 feet or three blocks for at least a week. The bill remains in committee. Moya leads the effort, but no safety analyst has weighed in on the impact for pedestrians or cyclists.

The bill’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to ferry service to Willets Point.' Moya’s measure would require the Department of Transportation to run regular ferries from Willets Point, Queens, to Manhattan.
