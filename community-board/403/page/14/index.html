An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

The avenue is a known danger.</p><p class=mb3>On March 13, 2024, in East Elmhurst, Queens, a pickup truck driver killed 8-year-old Bayron Palomino Arroyo and injured his 10-year-old brother as they crossed 100th Street. The driver, Jose Barcia, rushed a left turn from 31st Avenue and struck the children, according to NYPD Chief of Transportation Philip Rivera. Barcia faces charges of criminally negligent homicide, failure to yield, failure to exercise due care, and speeding. State Senator Jessica Ramos responded, calling for passage of 'Sammy's Law' to let the city set its own speed limits. Ramos said, 'I fight so hard for improved public transit because there are too many cars on the road, particularly SUVs and pickup trucks that do not allow for full visibility in city streets.' She urged fewer cars, especially large vehicles, and stressed the need for pedestrian safety in the budget. 31st Avenue, where the crash happened, saw 74 crashes and 47 injuries last year, far more than nearby, mostly car-free 34th Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sedan driver was distracted by a passenger, compounding the error. The sedan’s front passenger, a 21-year-old female, sustained a head injury and complained of pain and nausea. The driver suffered an upper arm and shoulder injury. Both occupants were restrained by lap belts and were not ejected. Vehicle damage was concentrated on the van’s left side doors and the sedan’s right front bumper.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill states: 'providing notice and an opportunity for comment before implementing a major traffic change.' It requires the Department of Transportation, or any relevant agency, to notify and allow comments from council members, community boards, and business improvement districts before removing a vehicular lane or parking for 500 feet or three blocks for at least a week. The bill remains in committee. Moya leads the effort, but no safety analyst has weighed in on the impact for pedestrians or cyclists. The bill’s effect on vulnerable road users is unknown.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers deserve the truth.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0255-2024 sits in the Committee on Public Safety after introduction on February 28, 2024. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle," forces the NYPD to add 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a specific reporting category in quarterly and annual use of force reports. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Won, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Avilés, Abreu, Ossé, Krishnan, Williams, Cabán, Nurse, Sanchez, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force. This change brings police violence by car into the light, exposing patterns that endanger pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
