An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a speeding driver in 2013, would let the city lower limits to 20 mph. The matter, described as 'Let New York City lower its own speed limits,' has strong support from the mayor, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, and advocates like Families for Safe Streets. Restler’s action was public advocacy. The Assembly is the final hurdle; the bill is already in the governor’s and Senate’s budgets. Advocates cite a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit change. Families demand action to prevent more deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The total cost is about $500 million, far less than any rail option. State Senator Jessica Ramos, district 13, praised the decision, saying, 'My neighbors who live around LaGuardia deserve transit that is for them, not whatever that boondoggle was.'

They called for education, better battery rules, and fair treatment for delivery workers. City Hall’s inaction leaves e-bike users exposed. Bans loom while agencies stall. Vulnerable riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, State Sen. Jessica Ramos and colleagues sent a letter to city and state DOTs urging action against the 'demonization' of e-bikes and e-scooters. The letter, signed by Ramos and State Sen. Liz Krueger, demanded more education on safe riding and battery use, warning, 'We cannot allow a narrative to build against a vital, green, and growing mode of transportation.' Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries. The senators warned that inaction could lead to blanket bans, hitting delivery workers hardest. The city’s plan for safe charging hubs faces local opposition. DOT claims a 'holistic approach,' but vulnerable riders remain at risk as agencies drag their feet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City pays more, gets less. Riders face fare hikes, no better service. State hoards surplus, starves transit. Lawmakers protest. Suburbs dodge taxes. The city shoulders the load. Riders pay the price. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Governor Hochul’s 2023 state budget proposal, analyzed March 3, 2023, keeps New York State’s long-running refusal to match MTA funding under law 18-b. The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt. The budget leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as transit stagnates and car dominance persists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
