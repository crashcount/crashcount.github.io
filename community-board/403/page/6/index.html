Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Zohran Mamdani all support expanding open streets and outdoor dining. Stringer pledges to 'loosen unnecessary design requirements' and simplify permits. Myrie promises a 'year-round outdoor dining program' and restoration of open streets, citing safety and access for pedestrians and cyclists. Ramos calls the current scheme 'unworkable' and urges consensus. Lander faults City Hall for 'over-regulating' and vows to speed up applications while 'respecting pedestrian traffic.' Mamdani highlights the economic and social benefits. All criticize current restrictions and bureaucratic hurdles.

No daylighting near schools. No lower bike lane speed limits. No new e-bike rules. City and state leaders bickered. Streets stay dangerous. Pedestrians and cyclists remain exposed. The system failed them again.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, during New York State’s $254-million budget negotiations, lawmakers rejected Governor Hochul’s proposed street safety measures. The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Stringer demanded 'massive expansion of protected bike lanes.' Myrie backed S1047, a bill for 50-percent e-bike rebates. Ramos called for safe bike lanes and clear signage for all riders. Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes.

Comptroller Brad Lander and several Democratic mayoral candidates support expansion. Ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a leading candidate, offers only a case-by-case review.

Their words center safety for people walking, biking, and riding transit.</p><p class=mb3>On May 6, 2025, Streetsblog NYC published 'Decision 2025: Mayoral Candidates Answer Our Question 3.' The piece asked candidates how they would make streets safer for walking and biking. Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Zohran Mamdani all responded. Stringer highlighted his push for protected bike lanes and daylighting. Myrie promised to meet or exceed the Streets Master Plan’s 50-mile annual bike lane goal and to end delays. Ramos pledged 200 miles of physically separated bike lanes and to close network gaps. Lander committed to the Streets Master Plan and fixing greenway connections. Mamdani vowed to use all mayoral powers for Vision Zero. Each candidate supports redesigning streets to protect vulnerable road users. Their plans focus on proven changes—protected lanes, pedestrian islands, daylighting, and bus lanes—to cut injuries and deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
