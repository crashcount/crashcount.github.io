An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

The report states the moped rider was 'partially ejected,' suffering severe lacerations to his entire body, and was found conscious and screaming at the scene. 'Unsafe Speed' is cited as a contributing factor in the crash, with 'Alcohol Involvement' also listed in the police data. The teen wore no helmet, as documented in the report. The Ford SUV was traveling west, while the moped headed north; both were reportedly going straight ahead before impact. The police narrative describes the aftermath in stark terms: 'Blood spread. He was awake. He screamed.' The crash underscores the lethal consequences of speed and alcohol on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
