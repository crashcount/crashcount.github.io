Introduced February 28, 2024, it urges the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), A.1901 (Crash Victims Bill of Rights), and the full SAFE Streets Act package. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ in relation to allowing New York city to establish a lower speed limit, and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gutiérrez, Restler, Ossé, Avilés, Sanchez, Krishnan, Rivera, Cabán, Brewer, Abreu, Marte, Brannan, Schulman, Won, Feliz, Bottcher, Nurse, Hudson, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The SAFE Streets Act targets reckless driving, demands safer street design, and gives crash victims more rights. The resolution’s focus is clear: fewer deaths, more justice, safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill pushes for a web tool to keep big rigs on legal routes. Sponsors say tech can stop trucks from straying. The measure sits in committee. No action yet. Streets wait.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0200-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on February 28, 2024. The bill would require the Department of Transportation to study if a web-based GPS map could keep trucks on city-approved routes. The matter title reads: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a truck route GPS study.” Council Members Alexa Avilés (primary), Jennifer Gutiérrez, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Lincoln Restler, and the Brooklyn Borough President requested the bill. They want DOT to report on the feasibility of a GPS-integrated truck route map. The bill aims to keep trucks off streets where they endanger people walking and biking. The measure is still in committee. No votes have been taken.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
