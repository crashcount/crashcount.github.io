An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.
