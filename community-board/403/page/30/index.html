Kids will walk free. No engines, no rush, no threat. The move follows a 42% drop in pedestrian injuries on 34th Avenue. Officials say car-free streets mean fewer dead children.</p><p class=mb3>On October 24, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a major expansion of car-free streets for Halloween. The initiative, called 'Trick-or-Streets,' will close 100 streets—across all boroughs except Staten Island—from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. The DOT will extend hours on 40 existing open streets and keep another 60 car-free through the evening, partnering with the Street Activity Permit Office for more pedestrian zones. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'I am incredibly excited to build on the triumph of our thriving Open Streets program ... this Halloween, providing greater access to safer, shared community spaces.' Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and Council Member Shekar Krishnan backed the move, stressing the deadly risk cars pose to children. DOT data shows a 42% drop in pedestrian injury crashes on 34th Avenue since it went car-free. The city cites national spikes in child pedestrian deaths on Halloween. The message is clear: car-free streets save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board circulated an email with misinformation about emergency access and parking. Jim Burke, the open street’s volunteer leader, was targeted with homophobic and xenophobic abuse. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and Borough President Donovan Richards condemned the hate, with Krishnan stating, 'Hate, homophobia, bigotry, threats have no place in our community.' Richards, a supporter of Paseo Park, said, 'We can disagree, but we need to be adults.' DOT spokesman Scott Gastel said the open street benefits the entire community, prioritizing pedestrians and children. The city’s plan removes curbside parking and adds plaza blocks, making streets safer for people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
