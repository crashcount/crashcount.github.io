The board circulated an email with misinformation about emergency access and parking. Jim Burke, the open street’s volunteer leader, was targeted with homophobic and xenophobic abuse. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and Borough President Donovan Richards condemned the hate, with Krishnan stating, 'Hate, homophobia, bigotry, threats have no place in our community.' Richards, a supporter of Paseo Park, said, 'We can disagree, but we need to be adults.' DOT spokesman Scott Gastel said the open street benefits the entire community, prioritizing pedestrians and children. The city’s plan removes curbside parking and adds plaza blocks, making streets safer for people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
