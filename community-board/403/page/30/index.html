An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

Ramos urged residents, 'Please do your part to keep our neighbors safe,' and condemned drunk driving. Councilmember Shekar Krishnan called the death 'senseless.'

The driver stayed at the scene and was arrested. Local officials mourned the loss. The deadly corridor has seen little change despite repeated deaths. The toll mounts. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On November 27, 2022, State Senator Jessica Ramos responded to a fatal crash in Council District 13. The incident occurred when a drunk driver struck and killed a scooter rider on 37th Avenue, a Vision Zero priority corridor in Queens. The official matter summary reads: 'Alleged Queens drunk driver in custody after fatal collision with scooter rider.' Ramos urged residents, 'Please do your part to keep our neighbors safe,' and condemned drunk driving. Councilmember Shekar Krishnan called the death 'senseless.' Despite five pedestrian deaths on this stretch in the past decade, major safety improvements have not been made. Ramos’s statement highlights the ongoing danger for vulnerable road users and the city’s failure to fix deadly streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The discussion, reported by nypost.com, focused on rising fire deaths and slower FDNY response times. The matter summary reads: 'Rising NYC fire deaths, response times blamed on traffic measures.' Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) argued that open street programs, bike lanes, and traffic islands hinder emergency vehicles, especially when illegal parking blocks access. She called for better enforcement. Other voices, including union leaders, echoed her concerns. However, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan defended new street designs, stating they were built with emergency input. The Department of Transportation said all projects include emergency routes and are monitored. FDNY officials attributed delays to increased post-pandemic traffic, not street safety measures. The debate highlights the ongoing conflict between car-free streets for vulnerable users and emergency vehicle access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
