An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, featured Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Whitney Tilson. Stringer demanded 'massive expansion of protected bike lanes.' Myrie backed S1047, a bill for 50-percent e-bike rebates. Ramos called for safe bike lanes and clear signage for all riders. Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes. All agreed: safer streets need better design, strong enforcement, and real protections for workers and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Comptroller Brad Lander and several Democratic mayoral candidates support expansion. Ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a leading candidate, offers only a case-by-case review. Advocates and organizers say the current funding is inadequate, calling it a "token show of support" and demanding $48 million over three years.

The event was not a council bill, but a public challenge. Streetsblog asked: 'Now that congestion pricing is operating in New York City, what should the city government do to build on its success in reducing Manhattan traffic?' Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Whitney Tilson responded, each supporting congestion pricing and further transit investment. Streetsblog’s demand was clear—protect vulnerable road users. The safety analyst notes that congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and opens the door for street redesigns that put vulnerable users first. The debate underscores urgency: congestion pricing helps, but more must be done to make streets safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She says the mayor should pick the NYC Transit boss. The push follows years of state failures. Riders face delays, confusion, and a system that ignores their needs.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2025, State Senator Jessica Ramos, representing District 13, announced her support for New York City taking control of its subway system. The current system is run by the state through the MTA. Ramos, a mayoral candidate, said, "I would love for the mayor of the City of New York to be able to appoint the New York City Transit president or to have a greater say in what happens in the system." The announcement came as part of a broader mayoral campaign debate, with other candidates like Brad Lander proposing a city-run authority called 'Big Apple Transit.' The push for city control follows years of service failures and frustration among riders. Ramos’s stance signals a demand for local accountability and a transit system that answers to the people who use it every day. No formal bill number or committee action is attached to this policy announcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Rosen pursued William McField, a 55-year-old motorcyclist, after a minor collision. On Woodhaven Boulevard, Rosen struck McField from behind, ran him over, and continued driving, dragging the motorcycle until it caught fire. Rosen then hit another car before stopping at a lamp post. McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes."
