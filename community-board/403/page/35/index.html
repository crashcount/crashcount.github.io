An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

The matter, titled 'Is It Time For Free Buses In New York City?', highlights calls from TWU Local 100 Vice-President JP Patafio and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas to end fare enforcement and make buses free. Patafio said, 'They should look at making local bus service free. As we saw during the pandemic, it's an essential public service.' González-Rojas argued that free buses sped up service and helped riders during the pandemic. She is working on proposals to boost MTA funding and pilot free lines. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber pushed back, citing a $2B-plus deficit and stressing the need for faster, more reliable buses. Advocates and officials agree: bus improvements and fare-free service are not mutually exclusive. The debate continues in committee, with no formal bill yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Krishnan said, 'I advocated for a linear park and how transformative it would be for our city.' Despite Adams’ past support—he once signed a petition for the park—he made no commitments during the visit. Funding for the conversion and for Citi Bike expansion was left out of the Department of Transportation budget. DOT and City Hall offered no clear answers on future plans or funding.

The Department of Transportation and Council Member Shekar Krishnan back a permanent car-free linear park. Mayor Adams has signed the petition. The article states: 'When cars are banished from roadways, total crashes drop dramatically and injuries to pedestrians and cyclists almost entirely disappear.' Luz Maria Mercado and Transportation Alternatives support expanding open streets citywide. DOT spokesman Seth Stein says, 'by reclaiming space from cars we make our streets safer.' The data is stark: from 2019 to 2021, crashes during open street hours fell from 26 to 6, injuries from 19 to 2.
