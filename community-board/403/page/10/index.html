On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.

One vehicle was traveling east going straight ahead, while the other was making a left turn. The collision point was the center front end of the eastbound sedan and the right rear quarter panel of the turning vehicle. The report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, indicating driver error in failing to obey traffic signals or signs. The front passenger in the eastbound sedan, a 39-year-old male, sustained neck injuries and whiplash but was not ejected and was restrained by a lap belt and harness. The drivers were licensed and operating vehicles registered in NY and VA.

The toll stirs anger, hope, and a fight over who pays and who breathes.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2025, congestion pricing (no bill number cited) will begin in Manhattan after a federal judge allowed the toll to proceed. The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The point of impact was the center front end of the vehicle. The report cites 'View Obstructed/Limited' as a contributing factor, indicating the driver’s limited visibility played a role in the crash. The pedestrian was injured in the knee, lower leg, and foot area, sustaining internal complaints but remained conscious. The vehicle sustained no damage. The driver was licensed and traveling southwest at the time. No pedestrian errors or contributing factors were noted beyond the obstructed view affecting the driver.
