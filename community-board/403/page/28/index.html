An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived.

The fight moves to City Planning.</p><p class=mb3>On November 7, 2022, Queens Community Board 2 passed a resolution rejecting a rezoning application for a Lincoln SUV dealership on Northern Boulevard, Woodside. The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The discussion, reported by nypost.com, focused on rising fire deaths and slower FDNY response times. The matter summary reads: 'Rising NYC fire deaths, response times blamed on traffic measures.' Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) argued that open street programs, bike lanes, and traffic islands hinder emergency vehicles, especially when illegal parking blocks access. She called for better enforcement. Other voices, including union leaders, echoed her concerns. However, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan defended new street designs, stating they were built with emergency input. The Department of Transportation said all projects include emergency routes and are monitored. FDNY officials attributed delays to increased post-pandemic traffic, not street safety measures. The debate highlights the ongoing conflict between car-free streets for vulnerable users and emergency vehicle access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, launched to comply with a 2019 law, mandates 150 miles of protected bus lanes by 2026—20 miles in 2022 alone. With two months left, only 5.4 miles were finished. González-Rojas declared, 'We demand to get our 20 miles of bus lanes.' The rally took place on Northern Boulevard, a corridor scarred by pedestrian deaths, including 9-year-old Giovanni Ampuero. His father spoke out: 'If you don’t improve the street, people are going to still get killed.' The Department of Transportation claims progress and a $900 million investment, but the pace lags.

On October 26, 2022, the MTA announced legal cycling on the Cross Bay Bridge, with sharrows painted on the path. The Henry Hudson Bridge will open to cyclists after a major renovation, expected by 2025. The MTA will award a contract for that work next year. Gonzalez-Rojas said, 'This is what we worked toward when...we introduced and passed the MTA Bike Access bill.' Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt called the move 'pretty good progress.' The MTA also plans to add bike parking at 37 subway stations and expand bike access near transit. The Verrazzano Bridge remains off-limits for now. The announcement marks a step forward, but cyclists still face barriers and delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The initiative, called 'Trick-or-Streets,' will close 100 streets—across all boroughs except Staten Island—from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. The DOT will extend hours on 40 existing open streets and keep another 60 car-free through the evening, partnering with the Street Activity Permit Office for more pedestrian zones. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'I am incredibly excited to build on the triumph of our thriving Open Streets program ... this Halloween, providing greater access to safer, shared community spaces.' Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and Council Member Shekar Krishnan backed the move, stressing the deadly risk cars pose to children. DOT data shows a 42% drop in pedestrian injury crashes on 34th Avenue since it went car-free. The city cites national spikes in child pedestrian deaths on Halloween. The message is clear: car-free streets save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
