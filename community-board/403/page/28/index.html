An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

Over 20 surpass 2019 numbers. Riders are workers, immigrants, people of color. MTA tweaks service—adds some, cuts some. Waits grow. Calls mount for more funding. Riders need frequent trains. Lives depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2023, Comptroller Tom DiNapoli reported that more than 20 New York City subway stations exceeded pre-pandemic ridership in December 2022. The recovery, strongest in outer boroughs and Upper Manhattan, highlights the reliance of working-class, immigrant, and communities of color on transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber said, 'these New Yorkers deserve the same frequent, safe reliable service that they've come to depend on over time.' State Sen. Jessica Ramos, representing the 7 train corridor, demanded state funding for six-minute off-peak service, noting, 'my neighbors are the ones who do work that they can't do from home.' The MTA has made service adjustments—some lines see more weekend trains, but peak service is trimmed, leading to longer waits. As total ridership lags, agency leaders and advocates warn that cuts hit those who need transit most. The fight for reliable, frequent service continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Attendees demanded safer biking and walking routes, saying, "There's really no segregated [bike] lane, so that would be the main thing." State Sen. Jessica Ramos pressed for immediate bike lanes, stressing, "We need bike lanes yesterday." The event, described as a first step in listening to community priorities, showed strong opposition to car-centric infrastructure. Multiple participants left notes calling for protected bike lanes. The session highlighted the urgent need to address dangerous conditions for pedestrians and cyclists around the stadium, with fans and officials united in demanding safer, more sustainable access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
