The bill demands the city install pedestrian lighting in at least 500 commercial corridors per year, aiming for a minimum of 1 footcandle (11 lux) on every sidewalk. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installation of pedestrian lighting fixtures.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Krishnan, Bottcher, and others. The committee has not yet voted. The bill’s text sets clear targets for coverage and contiguity, but action is stalled. Vulnerable road users remain in the dark until the city acts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, highlights a surge in pedestrian deaths—nineteen so far this year, with injuries up 2.6 percent. Councilmember Jessica Ramos, referencing two children recently hit in her district, called for scramble crosswalks outside schools and demanded urgent attention to street safety: 'I can’t keep getting calls like this.' Transportation Alternatives condemned the Department of Transportation for installing only two Leading Pedestrian Intervals on Glenwood Road since 2014, despite repeated fatalities. The group urged elected leaders to act now to prevent more deaths. The bill or action is not numbered, but the event underscores systemic failures and the urgent need for citywide safety improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The streets demand change.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 6808, titled 'Relates to establishing first responder safety zones and setting speed limits in such safety zones,' moved through committee and passed multiple Senate votes between May 2023 and March 2024. Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way. The bill targets that risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.'
