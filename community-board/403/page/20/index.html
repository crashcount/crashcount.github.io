An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

Two sedans, one traveling west and the other south, collided with impact on the right front quarter panel of one vehicle and the center front end of the other. The 70-year-old male passenger, seated in the right rear position and secured with a lap belt and harness, sustained contusions and injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot. The report lists unspecified contributing factors but does not cite any driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding. Both drivers were licensed and traveling straight ahead prior to the collision. No pedestrians or cyclists were involved, and no ejections occurred. The focus remains on the collision dynamics and resulting injuries to the vehicle occupant.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
