An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

The report states the SUV was traveling at an 'Unsafe Speed.' The narrative describes the vehicle coming fast, with the impact causing fatal injuries to the pedestrian, who died before emergency responders arrived. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for the driver. The report also notes the pedestrian was 'Crossing Against Signal,' but this is mentioned only after the driver’s excessive speed is cited. The collision underscores the lethal consequences when drivers operate at unsafe speeds, especially at intersections where pedestrians are present.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, highlights a surge in pedestrian deaths—nineteen so far this year, with injuries up 2.6 percent. Councilmember Jessica Ramos, referencing two children recently hit in her district, called for scramble crosswalks outside schools and demanded urgent attention to street safety: 'I can’t keep getting calls like this.' Transportation Alternatives condemned the Department of Transportation for installing only two Leading Pedestrian Intervals on Glenwood Road since 2014, despite repeated fatalities. The group urged elected leaders to act now to prevent more deaths. The bill or action is not numbered, but the event underscores systemic failures and the urgent need for citywide safety improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, which would let New York City control its own speed limits, stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refused to allow a vote, despite majority support. Brooklyn Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, a strong supporter, noted, 'Even [lawmakers] who had City Council members from their districts supporting the bill were still not interested.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.' City data shows a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit reduction. The bill remains in limbo, but advocates are not backing down.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
