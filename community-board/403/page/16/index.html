An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived.

The group wrote to MTA chairman Janno Lieber, stating, "Express buses play a vital role in Queens’ public transit network and only stand to become even more pivotal in the near and distant future." They criticized the MTA for boosting express bus service in Brooklyn and Staten Island but not Queens, calling the exclusion "unacceptable." The lawmakers stressed that many southeast and northeast Queens residents lack subway access and rely on express buses to reach Midtown. They argued the 10 percent LIRR discount is no substitute for robust bus service. Salazar and her colleagues support congestion pricing but insist its success depends on expanded, equitable transit for all vulnerable riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, discussed in committee, requires a Council vote for citywide changes and a six-month warning period for drivers. Kamillah Hanks (District 49) was mentioned in the debate. Assemblymember Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas stressed urgency, citing recent deaths. Brooklyn Councilmember Lincoln Restler pledged to push the measure forward. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives called for a citywide approach, not piecemeal action. The Department of Transportation thanked lawmakers but did not commit to a timeline. The debate highlights the tension between urgent safety needs and political delays.
