After a firefighter killed a young man while driving drunk and high at 83 mph, Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>said</a>, &ldquo;Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways.&rdquo; The victim’s brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/justin-diaz-queens-bmw-driver-michael-pena-drunk-speeding-mercedes-fdny-firefighter-crash/>said</a>, &ldquo;Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail&mldr; Justin will never walk the streets again.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Speed cameras work, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk.</strong> The city can lower speed limits now, but waits. Every day of delay is another roll of the dice.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand permanent speed cameras.

This state bill would 'allow bicyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs, and red lights as stop signs.' The resolution was introduced April 27, 2023, and filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. Sponsors included Mercedes Narcisse (primary), Lincoln Restler, Julie Won, Shekar Krishnan, Gale Brewer, Kevin Riley, Kristin Richardson Jordan, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The council cited studies showing safety benefits for all road users, noting that the Idaho stop 'gives bicyclists greater flexibility at stop signs and red lights, and thus, enhance[s] road safety.' The bill did not advance but signaled strong support for cyclist safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
