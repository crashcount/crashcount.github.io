An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

The opposition comes from members who might have more car-centered districts and may be more transportation deserts. They argue that this would create traffic and their constituents hate it, but there's a misunderstanding of the bill, because it gives basically the discretion to the city."" -- Jessica González-Rojas</p><p class=mb3>In the 2023 legislative session, Albany lawmakers failed to pass major street safety bills, including Sammy’s Law (which would let New York City set its own speed limits). The session ended June 13, 2023, with most safety and transit measures stalled in committee or blocked from a vote. The matter summary reads: 'This year's legislative session in Albany was considered one of the worst for livable streets and street safety, largely due to the failure to pass key bills such as Sammy's Law.' Council members and advocates like Eric McClure, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, Amy Cohen, and Sara Lind voiced anger and disappointment. McClure said, 'We have to give the state legislature an 'F' for wasting an entire session without advancing legislation to make streets safer or to improve public transit.' The Assembly’s inaction left vulnerable road users exposed. Only increased MTA funding and a free bus pilot moved forward. The rest—protection for cyclists, pedestrians, and bus riders—died in committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
