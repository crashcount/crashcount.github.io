An SUV driver went around a car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. They survived. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls had minor injuries.

The driver later went to the police. No charges had been filed as of publication, with the district attorney still reviewing the case.

Police found him unconscious on the tracks at 2:45 a.m. and said he was 'either riding the top of a No. 7 train entering the station or attempting to get onto the top.' The article notes six people, mostly teens, died subway surfing last year. This year, three have died. The MTA and NYPD have launched campaigns and drone patrols to deter such incidents, but the deaths continue.
