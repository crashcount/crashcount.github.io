Officials named them as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. A criminal complaint notes the driver had “a strong odor of alcohol” and stood unsteady after the crash. He refused a chemical test and faces vehicular manslaughter and DWI charges, reporters wrote. “Two people were killed. He was drunk,” said a victim’s sister outside court.

Three occupants in the SUV suffered head injuries and whiplash. Police cite driver inattention and following too closely as key factors in the crash.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred on Bronx River Parkway at 13:50. A 2022 Mazda SUV traveling southbound rear-ended a 2022 Ford pickup truck also heading south. The SUV's driver, a 61-year-old woman, along with two passengers aged 65 and 80, sustained head injuries and whiplash but were conscious and not ejected. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors, specifically noting the front passenger's involvement with these errors. The point of impact was the SUV's center back end striking the pickup's center front end. The report does not attribute any fault or contributing behavior to the victims, focusing solely on driver errors and systemic dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Bill pushes complete street design. Aim: safer roads for all. Pedestrians, cyclists, and riders get space. Car dominance challenged. Lawmakers move to cut street carnage.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 2714, titled 'Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles,' advanced through committee and passed several Senate votes, most recently on March 27, 2024. Sponsored by Timothy M. Kennedy with support from Jake Ashby, Jamaal Bailey, and others, the bill mandates street designs that protect everyone—not just drivers. The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The bill marks a shift away from car-first planning, forcing cities to build streets for people, not just traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
