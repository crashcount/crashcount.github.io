Officials named them as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. A criminal complaint notes the driver had “a strong odor of alcohol” and stood unsteady after the crash. He refused a chemical test and faces vehicular manslaughter and DWI charges, reporters wrote. “Two people were killed. He was drunk,” said a victim’s sister outside court.

The pedestrian was crossing with the signal.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred at 8:54 p.m. near Southern Boulevard in the Bronx. A 35-year-old male pedestrian was crossing the intersection with the signal when he was hit by a 2013 Acura SUV traveling north. The SUV driver was making a left turn and failed to yield right-of-way, contributing to the collision. The report cites driver inattention and distraction as key factors. The pedestrian sustained a head injury and was incoherent at the scene, suffering a concussion. The SUV showed no damage despite striking the pedestrian with its left front bumper. The report explicitly identifies the driver’s failure to yield and distraction as causes, without attributing fault to the pedestrian.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
