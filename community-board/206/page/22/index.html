Officials named them as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. A criminal complaint notes the driver had “a strong odor of alcohol” and stood unsteady after the crash.

You can ask for it.<br>— <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p><p>The Legislature moved another lever this year. The Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045) advanced in Senate committees with yes votes from local senators and co‑sponsors. It would force chronic violators to install speed limiters after repeated tickets or points. The goal is simple: stop the fastest few from killing the many.<br>— <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States: S4045</a></p><p>Albany also renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030.

EAST TREMONT. EAST FORDHAM. SOUTHERN BOULEVARD. The evening hours. The turn that doesn’t end. Two young riders gone on the parkway. A baby gone off Tremont. The map is written in short lines.
