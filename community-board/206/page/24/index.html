Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass, clipped a Volkswagen, then hit two bikes. Both riders were thrown and died at the hospital. Officials named them as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. A criminal complaint notes the driver had “a strong odor of alcohol” and stood unsteady after the crash. He refused a chemical test and faces vehicular manslaughter and DWI charges, reporters wrote. “Two people were killed. He was drunk,” said a victim’s sister outside court.
