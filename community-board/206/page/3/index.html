Another on Fordham Road. A child, not yet old enough for school, crushed on East Tremont. In the last three years, <strong>nine people have died</strong> in traffic crashes in Bronx Community Board 6. <strong>Thirteen more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>481 people have been hurt</strong>—kids, elders, workers, neighbors. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=the-sound-of-gunfire-the-silence-of-leadership>The Sound of Gunfire, the Silence of Leadership</h3><p>On a spring day near the Bronx Zoo, two drivers sped down Southern Boulevard, guns drawn. Bullets flew. A red Hyundai crashed into a stop sign. The wounded man called a cab to the hospital. He died there. &ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>said a deli worker</a>. The other driver fled. No arrests. No answers. Just the echo of shots and the blood on the street.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They have the power.</strong> The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Speed cameras can run 24/7, but only if Albany renews the law. Yet, the pace is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program—meant to keep repeat offenders off the road—has lapsed. The silence is louder than the sirens.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed. Trucks crushed.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and cars were involved in at least two pedestrian deaths and dozens of injuries. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the deadliest force is always the bigger machine. The street does not care who had the light. It only remembers who did not come home.</p><h3 id=what-now-the-call-that-cant-wait>What Now? The Call That Can&rsquo;t Wait</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first. The city has the power. <strong>Make them use it.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
