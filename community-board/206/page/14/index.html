A cyclist thrown from his bike. A pedestrian crushed by a truck on Fordham Road. In Bronx CB6, the street does not forgive. <strong>Nine people have died since 2022. Thirteen more suffered injuries so grave they may never heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, 488 people were hurt in crashes. Five were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=the-sound-of-gunfire-the-silence-of-leaders>The Sound of Gunfire, the Silence of Leaders</h2><p>On a spring day, two drivers sped down Southern Boulevard, guns blazing. The bullets flew. A man crashed his car and bled out before help could come. &ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>said a deli worker</a>.

Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in the Bronx, the pace of change is slow. <strong>One life lost is too many, but the work drags on.</strong></p><p>The numbers show who pays the price. Cars and SUVs killed and maimed most. Trucks and mopeds followed. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, another family is broken. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.

Vulnerable commuters wait.</p><p class=mb3>On July 20, 2023, the MTA called on Mayor Eric Adams and the Department of Transportation (DOT) to support renewed bus lane expansion on Fordham Road. The city had canceled a planned busway after pushback from business owners and Council Member Oswald Feliz, who remains a vocal critic. MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey said, "Our hope is that we DOT stays with us and we're implementing this, hopefully, later this year." MTA CEO Janno Lieber stressed, "We can't deemphasize and under-prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx and also Upper Manhattan who are trying to get east and west across this incredibly busy corridor." DOT spokesperson Vin Barone described a new proposal with dedicated curbside loading and minimal traffic diversions. The city’s earlier pledge for 20 new miles of bus lanes per year has not been met. Eighty-five thousand daily bus riders, many vulnerable, remain at risk on slow, crowded streets. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The session focused on a package to increase fines for phony or expired plates and penalize sellers of illegal tags. Deputy Chief Michael Pilecki told the committee, 'Any vehicle bearing one of these fraudulent plates instantly becomes undetectable to nearly every aspect of street level enforcement.' Council Member David Carr (District 50) offered Staten Island tow pound space to help the NYPD, which faces a shortage after the Manhattan pound closed. The NYPD reported towing is up 192% for covered plates, but limited storage stalls progress.

Numbers tell a different story. Arrests for fake plates drop. Summonses barely rise. DOT cameras miss over a million violations. Council weighs tougher fines. Riders and walkers pay the price for weak enforcement.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2023, the City Council held a hearing on NYPD enforcement against ghost cars—vehicles with fake, covered, or defaced plates. NYPD Transportation Bureau’s Michael Pilecki reported arrests for forged plates fell 11 percent from last year, while summonses rose just 0.6 percent. The hearing spotlighted two bills from Council Member Oswald Feliz to raise fines for using or selling fake plates, both widely supported, including by the NYPD. The matter summary: 'NYPD claims it has stepped up its efforts to summons and arrest car drivers who cover or deface their plate, or drive with a fake temporary tag, but its own statistics show that the effort has not continued into this year.' Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable. The city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill ordered quick towing of vehicles blocking space or hiding identity. Filed at session’s end, it aimed to cut hazards for those on foot or bike. No action taken.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1116-2023 was introduced on June 22, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill required the Department of Sanitation and NYPD to tow vehicles that block streets or lack visible, valid license plates, registration, or inspection stickers. The matter summary reads: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code...in relation to towing vehicles that are an encumbrance on the street or that lack, improperly display, or obscure valid license plates, registration stickers, inspection stickers, or vehicle identification numbers.” Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Salamanca, Brannan, Feliz, Stevens, Ung, Riley, and Schulman. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. Removing untraceable or abandoned vehicles could have reduced street dangers for pedestrians and cyclists, but the measure stalled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
