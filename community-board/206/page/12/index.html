A cyclist thrown from his bike. A pedestrian crushed by a truck on Fordham Road. In Bronx CB6, the street does not forgive. <strong>Nine people have died since 2022. Thirteen more suffered injuries so grave they may never heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, 488 people were hurt in crashes. Five were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=the-sound-of-gunfire-the-silence-of-leaders>The Sound of Gunfire, the Silence of Leaders</h2><p>On a spring day, two drivers sped down Southern Boulevard, guns blazing. The bullets flew. A man crashed his car and bled out before help could come. &ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>said a deli worker</a>.

Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in the Bronx, the pace of change is slow. <strong>One life lost is too many, but the work drags on.</strong></p><p>The numbers show who pays the price. Cars and SUVs killed and maimed most. Trucks and mopeds followed. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, another family is broken. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the NYPD to run tow pound facilities with enough capacity to deter illegal parking and traffic violations. It also mandated annual public reports on tow pound use and enforcement, disaggregated by precinct. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department tow pound capacity.' Council Members Kamillah Hanks (primary sponsor), Oswald Feliz, Sandra Ung, Lincoln Restler, Shaun Abreu, Farah N. Louis, Mercedes Narcisse, and Amanda Farías sponsored the bill. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. No safety analyst assessed the impact for vulnerable road users. The city’s failure to expand towing leaves illegal cars on sidewalks and crosswalks. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.'

The map must show disruptions, detours, hazards, and closures in real time. The bill summary states: 'Cyclists deserve the same attention and information already given to the city's drivers and transit riders in the form of notifications, updates, and well-marked detours.' Council Member Carlina Rivera sponsored the bill and led its passage. Rivera and Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt wrote, 'Disruption of any city bikeway requires public information, working detours and operational attention—not just an unheralded shut-down.' The law aims to end the chaos and danger of sudden bike lane closures, giving half a million daily riders the information they need to stay safe and keep moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
