A cyclist thrown from his bike. A pedestrian crushed by a truck on Fordham Road. In Bronx CB6, the street does not forgive. <strong>Nine people have died since 2022. Thirteen more suffered injuries so grave they may never heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, 488 people were hurt in crashes. Five were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=the-sound-of-gunfire-the-silence-of-leaders>The Sound of Gunfire, the Silence of Leaders</h2><p>On a spring day, two drivers sped down Southern Boulevard, guns blazing. The bullets flew. A man crashed his car and bled out before help could come. &ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>said a deli worker</a>.

Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in the Bronx, the pace of change is slow. <strong>One life lost is too many, but the work drags on.</strong></p><p>The numbers show who pays the price. Cars and SUVs killed and maimed most. Trucks and mopeds followed. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, another family is broken. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.
