A cyclist thrown from his bike. A pedestrian crushed by a truck on Fordham Road. In Bronx CB6, the street does not forgive. <strong>Nine people have died since 2022. Thirteen more suffered injuries so grave they may never heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, 488 people were hurt in crashes. Five were left with serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=the-sound-of-gunfire-the-silence-of-leaders>The Sound of Gunfire, the Silence of Leaders</h2><p>On a spring day, two drivers sped down Southern Boulevard, guns blazing. The bullets flew. A man crashed his car and bled out before help could come. &ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>said a deli worker</a>.

The street swallowed the story and moved on.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>The city says it is fighting for safety. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in the Bronx, the pace of change is slow. <strong>One life lost is too many, but the work drags on.</strong></p><p>The numbers show who pays the price. Cars and SUVs killed and maimed most. Trucks and mopeds followed. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, another family is broken. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.
