His passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died. Seven others were hurt. Police said, &ldquo;The cause of the crash was not immediately known.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>NY Daily News</a>.

The report states the SUV was making a left turn when the moped, traveling straight, collided with the SUV's right front bumper. The moped rider, a 30-year-old man, suffered crush injuries to his head. The police report attributes the collision to 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.' The moped rider's helmet cracked under the impact, but he remained conscious at the scene. The SUV sustained no damage, while the moped absorbed the force. The police report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the danger faced by vulnerable road users when drivers fail to yield.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Every vehicle gets a pedestrian safety score. The public sees it. No more hiding danger behind steel and glass.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 1675, now at the sponsorship stage, sits with the New York State Senate. Filed January 13, 2025, it aims to 'create a pedestrian safety rating system for motor vehicles which shall be posted on the department of motor vehicles' website.' Senator Andrew Gounardes leads, joined by Leroy Comrie, Michael Gianaris, Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Robert Jackson, Liz Krueger, Zellnor Myrie, Gustavo Rivera, Julia Salazar, Luis R. Sepúlveda, and Toby Ann Stavisky. The bill demands transparency. It would show the public which cars endanger walkers and which spare them. No safety analyst has yet weighed in, but the intent is clear: expose the risk, protect the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
