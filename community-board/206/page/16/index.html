The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ ... and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' The SAFE Streets Act package also includes safe passing for cyclists and complete street design mandates.

The measure was brought before the City Council and discussed at a City Hall press conference. The matter summary states the bill 'goes after the unscrupulous used car dealers profiting considerably off a huge black market for phony tags.'

On April 11, 2023, Council Member Oswald Feliz (D-Bronx) announced new legislation to fight temporary license plate fraud. The bill, introduced after a Streetsblog investigation, would empower the city to fine those selling fake temp tags and raise penalties for drivers using them. Fines start at $1,000 for sellers and $500 for drivers, with higher amounts for repeat offenses. The NYPD, Sheriff's Office, and Department of Consumer and Worker Protection would enforce the law. Feliz also urged New Jersey, Georgia, and the federal government to tighten temp tag rules. The matter summary reads: 'legislation to combat temporary license plate fraud.' Transportation Alternatives endorsed the bill, warning that fake plates put vulnerable road users at risk. Feliz said, 'We want to make sure that people are truly being deterred.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

His bill hikes fines for fake plates. First offenders pay $1,000. Repeat sellers pay $2,000. Drivers with bogus plates get $500, then $1,000. The crackdown aims to stop reckless, untraceable cars haunting city streets.</p><p class=mb3>Bronx Councilman Oswald Feliz introduced a legislative proposal on April 9, 2023, targeting fraudulent paper license plates, known as 'ghost cars.' The bill, not yet assigned a committee or status, seeks to impose a $1,000 fine for first-time sellers of fake plates and at least $2,000 for repeat offenders. Motorists caught driving with fraudulent plates would face a $500 fine for a first offense and $1,000 for subsequent violations, up from the current $65–$200 range. Feliz said, 'The plates are encouraging reckless behavior in our communities, and we must crack down on them.' The measure also calls for online marketplaces to remove fake plate listings and urges federal standards for more secure temporary plates. Feliz’s push follows police crackdowns and rising use of ghost cars for crimes and traffic violations. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
