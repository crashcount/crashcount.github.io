Four hundred twenty are hurt.</strong> In just over three years, Brooklyn CB56 has seen 582 crashes—one every other day. One life lost every six months. The wounds do not heal. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>.</p><p><strong>One child, one elder, one cyclist.</strong> The dead are not all the same. A 91-year-old man on a bike. A pedestrian, age 40, struck while crossing. A driver, age 24, crushed in his car. The Belt Parkway runs through it all. The names fade, but the pain stays.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Most victims are not behind the wheel.</strong> In the last year, 134 people were injured. One was killed. Only one was a driver. The rest were passengers, walkers, riders. The most vulnerable pay the highest price.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the killing.</strong> Three deaths came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses took none. Bikes took none. The road is not fair. The strong survive. The weak are left behind.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> Lower speed limits. More cameras. Promises of safer streets. But here, the carnage continues. The numbers do not move. The dead do not come back.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders day and night. But change is slow. Action is slower. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. These are choices. Every crash is a policy failure. Every injury is a warning. Every death is a demand.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand action.</strong></p><p><strong>If you wait, the road will not.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action to slow the speed and stop the carnage</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
