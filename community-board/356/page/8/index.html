Advocates say criminalization fails safety and justice.</p><p class=mb3>On June 26, 2024, the City Council held a hearing on a bill to decriminalize jaywalking. The bill, proposed by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, seeks to end criminal penalties for crossing streets outside crosswalks. The matter summary states officials argue, 'keeping it illegal protects pedestrian safety.' DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione testified against full legalization, supporting only a reduction to a civil offense. NYPD Deputy Chief Thomas Alps defended targeted enforcement in high-crash areas. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the law's fairness, noting most tickets go to Black and Brown New Yorkers. Advocates criticized the city's stance, saying criminalization does not improve safety and harms communities of color. The bill remains under debate, with no clear path forward.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The council will hear the measure Tuesday.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2024, Council Member Mercedes Narcisse introduced a bill to decriminalize jaywalking in New York City. The measure heads to its first hearing before the transportation committee. Narcisse’s bill responds to city data: in 2023, 92 percent of jaywalking summonses went to Black or Latino New Yorkers; in early 2024, that number rose to 96.5 percent. Narcisse calls this 'a troubling picture of racial disparities.' She states, 'Jaywalking should not be a criminal matter that disproportionately impacts certain groups based on race or ethnicity.' Narcisse urges the city to redirect police resources and end selective enforcement. The bill aims to protect the rights of all residents and promote equity in city policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, currently with only eight co-sponsors out of 51, aims to 'permit pedestrians to legally cross a roadway at any point, including outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk, and allow for crossing against traffic signals.' Narcisse states the goal is to 'legalize the activity commonly referred to as 'jaywalking' and specify that no penalties can be imposed.' The move follows years of data showing NYPD’s racially biased enforcement: in 2023, 92 percent of jaywalking tickets went to Black or Latino residents, who make up just 55 percent of the city’s population. Lawmakers have long sought to end this pattern. The NYPD did not comment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
