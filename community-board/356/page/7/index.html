The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><p>A 91-year-old cyclist dies after a crash. A 40-year-old woman, crossing the parkway, is hit and killed. A 24-year-old driver, crushed in his car.

A string, stretched across the bike lane, cut one man’s throat and sent another to the hospital. The police found no crime. The city bans kite fighting, but the ban is not enforced. “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable,” said Danny Mundy, a local leader. “We can’t do this no more because someone is going to get killed,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/incredible-amount-of-blood-but-nypd-finds-no-crime-after-string-slices-bicyclists-on-bridge>said Danny Mundy</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders. But the silence is louder than the action. The speed limit is not yet lowered. The camera law is at risk of expiring. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. The dead cannot call.
