They are the cost of delay, of inaction, of leaders who wait for another name on a slab. <strong>Contact your council member. Demand daylighting. Demand protected crossings.

Epps left the scene, tried to escape in an Uber, and was arrested after fleeing on foot. The crash was one of three fatal Brooklyn incidents that weekend.
