A string, stretched across the bike lane, cut one man’s throat and sent another to the hospital. The police found no crime. The city bans kite fighting, but the ban is not enforced. “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable,” said Danny Mundy, a local leader. “We can’t do this no more because someone is going to get killed,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/incredible-amount-of-blood-but-nypd-finds-no-crime-after-string-slices-bicyclists-on-bridge>said Danny Mundy</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph.

Each risk is a life.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

The event, held at the Verrazano Bridge, included U.S. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Council Member Joe Borelli, and others.

The rally's matter title: 'Staten Island, Brooklyn pols rally against congestion pricing as Hochul considers reviving program.'

The bill orders the Commissioner of Transportation, with the Chancellor of New York City Public Schools, to conduct yearly studies to find non-operational schools. The matter title reads: 'Annual study to identify non-operational schools and the subsequent removal of speed cameras from eliminated school speed zones.' Council Members Chris Banks (District 42, primary sponsor) and Kamillah Hanks (District 49, co-sponsor) back the measure. If passed, speed cameras must be removed from zones tied to closed schools. The bill’s plain language summary confirms cameras will be pulled from these areas. No safety analyst has weighed in, but the removal of cameras means less oversight where children and families once crossed.

The collision resulted from 'Unsafe Lane Changing' and 'Following Too Closely,' both cited as contributing factors. The impact occurred at the right rear bumpers of both vehicles. A 23-year-old male occupant seated as the right rear passenger was injured, sustaining neck injuries and experiencing shock. He was restrained with a lap belt and harness and complained of pain and nausea. The report highlights driver errors—specifically unsafe lane changing—as the cause of the crash.

The vote: 40 for, eight against.</p><p class=mb3>On September 26, 2024, the New York City Council passed a modified jaywalking decriminalization bill. The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, cleared the Council with 40 votes in favor and eight against. The bill's summary states it 'legalizes jaywalking, allowing pedestrians to walk into the street outside of crosswalks.' Narcisse stressed, 'Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.' The legislation removes jaywalking as a pretext for police stops, though officers may still intervene for other reasons. The Department of Transportation must now educate the public on street rights and responsibilities. Advocates hailed the bill as historic, but say more must be done to protect pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates warned new language could blame pedestrians for crashes. The bill would have let people cross mid-block, but now demands they yield to drivers. Racial bias in enforcement remains unaddressed.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2024, the City Council delayed action on a bill to legalize jaywalking. The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with advocates demanding stronger protections for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city must plant trees or use medians for stormwater. Agencies must report progress. The law targets high-risk areas. Votes showed strong support. The mayor returned it unsigned. Streets will change.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0746-2024, now Local Law 94 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 12, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
