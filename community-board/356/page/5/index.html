The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><p>A 91-year-old cyclist dies after a crash. A 40-year-old woman, crossing the parkway, is hit and killed. A 24-year-old driver, crushed in his car.

A string, stretched across the bike lane, cut one man’s throat and sent another to the hospital. The police found no crime. The city bans kite fighting, but the ban is not enforced. “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable,” said Danny Mundy, a local leader. “We can’t do this no more because someone is going to get killed,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/incredible-amount-of-blood-but-nypd-finds-no-crime-after-string-slices-bicyclists-on-bridge>said Danny Mundy</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders. But the silence is louder than the action. The speed limit is not yet lowered. The camera law is at risk of expiring. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. The dead cannot call.

Three bills were considered: a daylighting bill by Councilmember Julie Won to ban parking near crosswalks and require 1,000 daylighting barriers per year; a bill by Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse to waive extra fees for late parking ticket responses; and a bill by Councilmember Natasha Williams to create overnight truck parking in industrial zones. The matter summary reads: 'NYC Council to examine truck parking, daylighting and fine relief in hearing on city parking woes.' Narcisse’s bill targets fee relief for drivers who respond to violations between 45 and 90 days. Won’s daylighting bill drew support from 120 organizations. DOT faced questions on loading zones, permit abuse, and intersection safety. The hearing spotlighted the city’s struggle to balance safety for pedestrians and cyclists with business and driver concerns.

Their son remains hospitalized. The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 21 speeding tickets—15 in school zones—over two years. Lawmakers and advocates called for legislation requiring speed limiter devices on cars of drivers with more than six camera violations. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said the driver 'clearly would've met the threshold.' NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the crash 'a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.' The bill aims to prevent repeat offenders from exceeding speed limits. Lawmakers hope to present it by June.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, championed by Councilwoman Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, cleared the chamber in a veto-proof 40-8 vote. The bill's matter title: 'Jaywalking in NYC is set to be legal.' The legislation eliminates the $250 fine for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione testified against the bill, warning, 'Over the last five years, 200 people lost their lives while crossing the street mid-block or against the signal, making up about 34 percent of all pedestrian fatalities.' Mayor Eric Adams neither signed nor vetoed the bill, allowing it to become law. City Hall and NYPD officials continue to urge pedestrians to follow traffic rules. The Department of Transportation must now draft rules to implement the change.
