Introduced February 13, 2025, it urges the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to conduct 'longitudinal studies on the environmental, economic, and social impacts of congestion pricing throughout New York City.' Council Member Lynn C. Schulman leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Farías, Louis, Riley, Williams, and Banks. The measure responds to fears that congestion pricing could shift traffic and pollution to outer boroughs, especially transit deserts. The sponsors want the MTA to track real-world effects—on air, streets, and people—so the city can adapt the program and protect vulnerable communities. The bill is under committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that electric bicycles and electric scooters that are part of share systems have speedometers and limit electric speed assistance to new riders," would force all shared e-bikes and e-scooters to have working speedometers. For new riders, electric assist would cut out at 10 miles per hour. Council Members Linda Lee (primary sponsor), Gale A. Brewer, and Chris Banks back the measure. The bill aims to slow inexperienced users and make speeds visible. It remains in committee. No safety analyst has yet assessed its impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law requires the Department of Transportation to consult with the Fire Department before approving open street applications, bicycle lane projects, or major transportation projects. The official matter title states the law amends the city code to require DOT to consult with FDNY and notify affected firehouses before moving forward. Primary sponsor Kalman Yeger, with co-sponsors including Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, Lynn Schulman, and others, pushed the bill through. The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes. No safety analyst assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users. The law’s effect: more agencies weigh in, but the process for safer streets grows longer and more complex.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
