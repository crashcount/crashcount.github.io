The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><p>A 91-year-old cyclist dies after a crash. A 40-year-old woman, crossing the parkway, is hit and killed. A 24-year-old driver, crushed in his car.

A string, stretched across the bike lane, cut one man’s throat and sent another to the hospital. The police found no crime. The city bans kite fighting, but the ban is not enforced. “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable,” said Danny Mundy, a local leader. “We can’t do this no more because someone is going to get killed,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/incredible-amount-of-blood-but-nypd-finds-no-crime-after-string-slices-bicyclists-on-bridge>said Danny Mundy</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders. But the silence is louder than the action. The speed limit is not yet lowered. The camera law is at risk of expiring. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. The dead cannot call.

The plan, a priority for the Adams administration and MTA, aims to speed up the B41 bus from Downtown Brooklyn to Marine Park. Narcisse and Councilmember Rita Joseph joined Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference, riding the B41 and speaking with riders. Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
