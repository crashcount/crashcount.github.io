The Senate voted, with most in favor and a block opposed. The bill's language is blunt: roads must be safe for all, not just drivers.

One suffered a slashed throat and blood loss, the other needed stitches. The string’s source remains unclear. Kite fighting blamed, but city action lags. Riders bleed. System fails.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-06-07) reports two cyclists were injured by a string suspended across the Marine Parkway Bridge. One cyclist, Robert Hillebrand, suffered a severed windpipe and required blood transfusions. Another, Jennifer Noble, received stitches and a broken finger. Police said the string was likely from kite fighting, a practice where glass-coated strings are used to cut opponents' kites. Witnesses described a yellow nylon string stretched across the bike lane. The NYPD found no criminality. The city parks department bans kite fighting but enforcement is lacking. Danny Mundy, a local civic leader, said, “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable.” Previous injuries and lawsuits linked to kite string in the area highlight ongoing risks for cyclists and wildlife. No driver involvement was reported, but the incident exposes gaps in infrastructure and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bus lanes and pedestrian islands will take their place. Fifty-five killed or badly hurt since 2019. Buses crawl. Pedestrians dodge traffic. The city moves to fix a deadly, clogged corridor.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 4, 2025, that New York City's Department of Transportation plans to overhaul Flatbush Avenue between Livingston Street and Grand Army Plaza. The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City Council Member Mercedes Narcisse announced plans to introduce a bill mandating ferry service for Canarsie, citing 'a transportation desert' and the need for better connections. Jibreel Jalloh, leading the rally, said, 'We must bridge this gap and demand the connectivity we deserve.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams backed the call, while Sheryl Boyce stressed the need for accessible transit. City Hall said there are no current plans for a new line. According to safety analysts, adding a ferry route mainly improves transit access; without better walking or biking links to the dock, the impact on vulnerable road users remains minimal.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
