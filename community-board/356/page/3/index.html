A string, stretched across the bike lane, cut one man’s throat and sent another to the hospital. The police found no crime. The city bans kite fighting, but the ban is not enforced. “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable,” said Danny Mundy, a local leader. “We can’t do this no more because someone is going to get killed,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/incredible-amount-of-blood-but-nypd-finds-no-crime-after-string-slices-bicyclists-on-bridge>said Danny Mundy</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph.

Each risk is a life.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

Streets stay dangerous for walkers.</p><p class=mb3>On March 23, 2025, the New York City Council passed a bill to decriminalize jaywalking. The measure, championed by Councilwoman Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, cleared the chamber in a veto-proof 40-8 vote. The bill's matter title: 'Jaywalking in NYC is set to be legal.' The legislation eliminates the $250 fine for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione testified against the bill, warning, 'Over the last five years, 200 people lost their lives while crossing the street mid-block or against the signal, making up about 34 percent of all pedestrian fatalities.' Mayor Eric Adams neither signed nor vetoed the bill, allowing it to become law. City Hall and NYPD officials continue to urge pedestrians to follow traffic rules. The Department of Transportation must now draft rules to implement the change. Vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
