One cyclist, Robert Hillebrand, suffered a severed windpipe and required blood transfusions. Another, Jennifer Noble, received stitches and a broken finger. Police said the string was likely from kite fighting, a practice where glass-coated strings are used to cut opponents' kites. Witnesses described a yellow nylon string stretched across the bike lane. The NYPD found no criminality. The city parks department bans kite fighting but enforcement is lacking. Danny Mundy, a local civic leader, said, “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable.” Previous injuries and lawsuits linked to kite string in the area highlight ongoing risks for cyclists and wildlife. No driver involvement was reported, but the incident exposes gaps in infrastructure and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City Council Member Mercedes Narcisse announced plans to introduce a bill mandating ferry service for Canarsie, citing 'a transportation desert' and the need for better connections. Jibreel Jalloh, leading the rally, said, 'We must bridge this gap and demand the connectivity we deserve.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams backed the call, while Sheryl Boyce stressed the need for accessible transit. City Hall said there are no current plans for a new line. According to safety analysts, adding a ferry route mainly improves transit access; without better walking or biking links to the dock, the impact on vulnerable road users remains minimal.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
