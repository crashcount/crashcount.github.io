Last week, an 84-year-old driver sped through a stop sign at 19th Avenue and 42nd Street in Astoria. The car hit two men waiting for coffee. Both died. The driver died too. Witnesses said the car was &ldquo;going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people have died and over 1,000 have been injured on these streets. Six suffered injuries so severe they may never walk right again. The dead are not numbers. They are brothers, fathers, neighbors. &ldquo;He was always happy. He would make you happy. He would make happy any person in the world,&rdquo; said a victim’s brother (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-speed-and-steel>The Pattern: Speed and Steel</h3><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. In this district, SUVs and sedans alone have taken two lives and injured hundreds. Trucks and buses have killed one and hurt dozens more. Bikes and mopeds injure, but the carnage comes on four wheels. The numbers do not lie: 16 deaths, 3,014 injuries, 21 left with life-changing wounds since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leaders-words-votes-and-waiting>Leaders: Words, Votes, and Waiting</h3><p>After the latest crash, local leaders spoke. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani called for &ldquo;the acceleration of the adoption of Sammy&rsquo;s Law and has proposed a plan to limit car traffic outside our schools&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Council Member Tiffany Cabán demanded a 20 mph limit and more daylight at corners. Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes to curb repeat speeders with speed-limiting tech (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</p><p>But the street stays the same. The speed stays the same. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day the city delays a 20 mph limit, another family risks losing someone. Every day without real enforcement, the same drivers speed by. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its power to slow the streets and save lives.</p><p>Do not wait for another body on the pavement. Demand action now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure, discussed in committee, requires a Council vote for citywide changes and a six-month warning period for drivers. Kamillah Hanks (District 49) was mentioned in the debate. Assemblymember Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas stressed urgency, citing recent deaths. Brooklyn Councilmember Lincoln Restler pledged to push the measure forward. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives called for a citywide approach, not piecemeal action. The Department of Transportation thanked lawmakers but did not commit to a timeline. The debate highlights the tension between urgent safety needs and political delays. Vulnerable road users remain at risk until the city acts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The decision ended funding for the MTA's pilot program that made one bus route in each borough free. The matter, titled 'NYC to get a boost in bus service, but pilot program for free routes ends,' highlights the trade-off: more buses, but no more free rides. Councilmember Kamillah Hanks of District 49 introduced a resolution urging the MTA to install at least 30 OMNY card vending machines in every borough, noting not all riders can pay by smartphone. The bill is not tied to a specific council committee or number. Hanks is mentioned for her advocacy on OMNY access. The move increases bus frequency but leaves low-income and cash riders behind.

Mastro is known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, having fought the Prospect Park West bike lane and represented New Jersey against congestion pricing. Council Members Sandy Nurse and Tiffany Caban voiced strong opposition, with Caban declaring, 'No way in hell I vote to confirm Randy Mastro.' Joe Borelli, a congestion pricing opponent, supported the move, saying, 'I want more people who think like me on congestion pricing in City Hall.' The appointment signals a car-first agenda. Council resistance is fierce. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—face greater risk if Mastro’s priorities shape city policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
