The chase ran through crowded streets. The driver did not stop. Amanda died in the road.</p><p>Her father spoke after the arrest. &ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood, and we were very upset that that&rsquo;s what actually happened,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>he told reporters</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, a 42-year-old man died at 36th Avenue and 36th Street. A 15-year-old was killed on a moped. The list grows. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> Council Member Tiffany Cabán co-sponsored the law that ended jaywalking tickets, shifting blame away from pedestrians and back to drivers (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legislation to end jaywalking tickets</a>). She also backed bills for protected bike lanes and daylighting crosswalks. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez and others supported new protected bike lanes on 31st Street, over the loud objections of some business owners (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>protected bike lanes on 31st Street</a>).</p><p>But the streets are still deadly. Promises do not stop cars. <strong>Every delay means another family waits for a knock at the door.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and enforcement that targets reckless drivers—not the people they hit. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The measure, supported by Council Members Tiffany Caban and Shahana Hanif, aims to 'greenlight pedestrians to freely cross streets outside the crosswalk or without obeying traffic signals.' The bill responds to claims of biased enforcement against Black and Latino New Yorkers. Council Majority Leader Joseph Borelli and Councilwoman Joann Ariola oppose the bill, warning it could endanger pedestrians. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or received a hearing. The NYPD and Mayor's office are reviewing the legislation. The debate highlights the tension between enforcement fairness and the ongoing risk to vulnerable road users.

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It would legalize the activity commonly referred to as ‘jaywalking’ and specify that no penalties can be imposed for jaywalking.” Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Narcisse, Won, Farías, Hanif, Ayala, Richardson Jordan, Krishnan, and Nurse.

Their bulk crushes bodies and streets. Lawmakers want heavier vehicles to pay more. Revenue would fund safer roads. The bill follows a grim rise in deaths, especially among children. The city bleeds. The council moves. The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill to increase registration fees for heavy vehicles and SUVs in New York. The proposal, announced June 23, 2023, aims to direct new revenue toward street safety projects. The report behind the bill states: 'Injuries from crashes involving large vehicles increased by 91 percent and fatalities by 75 percent between 2016 and 2019.' Mamdani said, 'This is an initiative to make our streets safer for our children.' Gounardes called out the public cost of 'mini-tanks.' The bill responds to data showing nearly half of children killed on city streets were struck by drivers of large vehicles, rising to 80 percent in 2022. Lawmakers call this common-sense action to address the deadly toll of oversized cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
