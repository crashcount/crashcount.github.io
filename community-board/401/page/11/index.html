The article, published October 28, 2024, details community outrage after a cyclist’s death and repeated injuries. NYPD policy says chases should end when risk outweighs reward, but enforcement fails. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. Comptroller Brad Lander says, 'Drivers who are repeatedly caught by speed and red-light cameras currently face no consequences other than a fine in the mail. Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.' State Senator Michael Gianaris calls for stronger penalties, including suspending registrations. The NYPD has not adopted reforms. Residents and advocates demand legislative action and transparency. Without it, vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He pushes for congestion pricing, free bus service, and higher taxes on the rich to fund transit. He calls City Hall corrupt. He stands with working New Yorkers. His platform targets safer, fairer streets.</p><p class=mb3>On October 22, 2024, Zellnor Myrie, representing District 20, announced his candidacy for New York City mayor. The announcement is not a council bill but a campaign launch, with Myrie’s platform focused on transportation reform. He supports congestion pricing, free bus service in every borough, and increased taxes on the wealthy to fund the MTA. Myrie described City Hall as 'engulfed in corruption' and said, 'New Yorkers are being crushed by rent and child care.' He has criticized Mayor Adams and pledged to fight for working-class New Yorkers. Though no formal safety analysis is attached, Myrie’s support for transit funding and congestion pricing signals a shift toward safer, less car-dominated streets. His campaign centers vulnerable road users and public transit riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report details that the bike’s front wheel impacted her leg, causing severe lacerations to her knee and lower leg. The victim remained conscious but was left bleeding on the asphalt. Police cite 'View Obstructed/Limited' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors to the crash. The victim was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal, but the report explicitly lists driver inattention and obstructed view as primary causes.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

But other bridges still leave vulnerable users stranded. Advocates demand more.</p><p class=mb3>On September 25, 2024, the MTA completed a major upgrade to the Cross Bay Bridge, replacing its hazardous Rockaway-side ramp with a wider, ADA-compliant path. This action fulfills a mandate from the 2021 MTA Bike Access bill. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, who sponsored the law, said, "I'm excited about the ADA-accessible ramp on the Cross Bay Bridge and that cyclists and pedestrians can access this space... because we passed my legislation." The MTA also announced similar improvements for the Henry Hudson and Triboro Bridges. However, plans for the Verrazzano, Gil Hodges-Marine Parkway, Bronx-Whitestone, and Throgs Neck bridges remain uncertain. Cycling advocates praised the MTA’s progress but criticized its reluctance to consider lane conversions for safer, broader access. The new ramp removes a deadly barrier, but the fight for safe passage on all city bridges continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
