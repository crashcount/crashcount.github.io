Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Yeger, Stevens, Hanif, Bottcher, Krishnan, and many others. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. The Atlantic Ticket pilot, launched in 2018, gave Southeast Queens and Brooklyn riders cheaper LIRR fares. Advocates say expanding it citywide could mean faster, safer commutes and more transit riders.

The measure passed quickly, bypassing lengthy review. The bill’s summary: relief from rising fuel prices. Councilmember Zohran Kwame Mamdani voted against it, citing environmental and equity harms: “This subsidizes the fossil fuel industry by $585M... I voted no.” Advocates like Danny Pearlstein (Riders Alliance) and Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) condemned the holiday as bad policy, warning it undercuts transit funding and encourages driving. Kate Slevin (Regional Plan Association) questioned future road repair funding. Meanwhile, congestion pricing—meant to cut traffic and fund transit—remains stalled. The swift gas tax cut, critics say, leaves vulnerable road users exposed to more cars, more danger, and less support.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The official title: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make bus and subway announcements in the four most commonly spoken languages in New York City.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Sandra Ung, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Tiffany Cabán backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided, but the intent was clear: break the language barrier, reach millions of riders, and give all New Yorkers equal warning and access on transit. The MTA still makes most announcements in English only.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
