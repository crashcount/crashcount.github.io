Council Member Tiffany Cabán and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani have called for safer streets, but the default speed limit is still too high. Each delay is another risk.

The measure, discussed in committee, requires a Council vote for citywide changes and a six-month warning period for drivers. Kamillah Hanks (District 49) was mentioned in the debate. Assemblymember Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas stressed urgency, citing recent deaths. Brooklyn Councilmember Lincoln Restler pledged to push the measure forward. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives called for a citywide approach, not piecemeal action. The Department of Transportation thanked lawmakers but did not commit to a timeline. The debate highlights the tension between urgent safety needs and political delays.

The driver, a 57-year-old man, was held by his seatbelt but suffered severe head lacerations and was found semiconscious. The report states the box truck was stationary at the time of impact. 'Unsafe Speed' is listed as the primary contributing factor in the crash. The sedan's center front end struck the truck's back, crumpling metal and leaving the driver injured.

The free bus pilot dies. Riders get more buses but lose free rides. Councilmember Hanks pushes for more OMNY machines. The city moves, but not all riders win.</p><p class=mb3>On April 26, 2024, New York State lawmakers approved over $12 million to increase bus service across New York City. The decision ended funding for the MTA's pilot program that made one bus route in each borough free. The matter, titled 'NYC to get a boost in bus service, but pilot program for free routes ends,' highlights the trade-off: more buses, but no more free rides. Councilmember Kamillah Hanks of District 49 introduced a resolution urging the MTA to install at least 30 OMNY card vending machines in every borough, noting not all riders can pay by smartphone. The bill is not tied to a specific council committee or number. Hanks is mentioned for her advocacy on OMNY access. The move increases bus frequency but leaves low-income and cash riders behind. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Sandy Nurse and Tiffany Caban voiced strong opposition, with Caban declaring, 'No way in hell I vote to confirm Randy Mastro.' Joe Borelli, a congestion pricing opponent, supported the move, saying, 'I want more people who think like me on congestion pricing in City Hall.' The appointment signals a car-first agenda.
