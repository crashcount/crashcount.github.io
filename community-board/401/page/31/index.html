She also backed bills for protected bike lanes and daylighting crosswalks. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez and others supported new protected bike lanes on 31st Street, over the loud objections of some business owners (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>protected bike lanes on 31st Street</a>).</p><p>But the streets are still deadly. Promises do not stop cars. <strong>Every delay means another family waits for a knock at the door.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and enforcement that targets reckless drivers—not the people they hit.

They want faster trains, better buses, and no fare hikes. They demand the state tax the rich to pay for it. Riders wait. Buses crawl. Service cuts loom. The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>On February 22, 2023, Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani (District 36) joined advocates and labor at a rally urging Governor Hochul and state legislators to increase MTA funding and expand service in the state budget. The event, covered by amny.com, called for a $300 million boost to the governor's plan, aiming to cut subway headways to six minutes, make buses free, and avoid fare hikes. The coalition, including the Riders Alliance and TWU Local 100, argued that current service leaves riders waiting over ten minutes and crawling on slow buses. Mamdani, prime sponsor of the Fix the MTA package, said, 'They are at risk of being priced out of one of their most basic human rights, the right to go around their city.' He pushed for higher corporate taxes to fund these improvements. TWU Local 100 president Richard Davis and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams also spoke out against service cuts. The governor's office did not endorse Mamdani's tax proposal. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, saw Simon and other officials racing at Smith-9th Streets station to dramatize the daily struggle of straphangers. The matter focused on 'the impact of low MTA funding and long wait times.' Simon said, 'It is really critically important...for people to be able to take reliable, safe, regular, speedy-enough transit service. That’s what’s going to get people out of their cars.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymembers Robert Carroll and Zohran Mamdani also participated, urging Albany to boost state funding and implement congestion pricing. The lawmakers oppose fare hikes and the rider-funded model, calling for public dollars to improve frequency and reliability.

The event, led by Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Robert Carroll, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum, responded to Governor Hochul’s budget proposal. The matter: 'Advocates and legislators raced up the stairs...to press their case for Gov. Hochul to do more to fill the MTA's fiscal gap.' Hochul’s plan stabilizes finances but does not boost service or halt fare hikes. Mamdani and Gounardes called for six-minute off-peak trains and new taxes on the wealthy. Gounardes said, 'We all know that we need better service and we need more service.' The proposal remains under negotiation.
