The dead include children, cyclists, elders. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just last fall, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was struck and killed in Astoria. She was riding home from a cycling event. A pickup, fleeing police, hit her at the intersection of 37th Street and 34th Avenue. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>A father mourned. <strong>&ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood,&rdquo;</strong> he <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-no-end-in-sight>The Pattern: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not slow. In the last year alone, three more people died. <strong>Children, teens, adults—all struck down.</strong> Hundreds more were hurt. The killers are cars, SUVs, trucks, mopeds. The wounds are broken bones, crushed skulls, lives erased at the curb.</p><p>The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken. But the city does not stop the blood.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Tiffany Cabán <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop the real danger—drivers who do not yield. Cabán also co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>backed the 31st Street protected bike lane plan</a>, a proven way to save lives.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. <strong>Every day without change is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and a 20 mph speed limit.</strong> Demand that leaders act before another family gets the call. The dead do not get a second chance. The living must not wait.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated.

City Comptroller Brad Lander echoed the urgency, calling mass transit 'the lifeblood of NYC.' The rally criticized Mayor Adams and former Governor Cuomo for failing bus riders and not meeting the NYC Streets Plan’s promise of 10 to 15 new bus lanes each year. Betsy Plum of Riders Alliance said, 'He was meant to be implementing the NYC Streets Plan... He has woefully failed at that.'

The project, first announced under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced delays after Mayor Eric Adams took office. The north outer roadway is now for cyclists, the south for pedestrians. State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, District 12, praised the completion, saying, 'After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [the city's Department of Transportation] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge.' Gianaris also criticized the unexplained delays. The plan ends years of conflict and danger for vulnerable road users forced to share a narrow lane.

Starting May 18, the north outer roadway becomes bike-only, while the south outer roadway, once for vehicles, opens to pedestrians. The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays.

The plan, detailed in his mayoral campaign, calls for fully staffing the Department of Transportation's bus unit, painting at least 30 miles of new bus lanes each year, and expanding transit signal priority. Mamdani says, 'There is a portion of that 'fast' that comes from the fact that if you make it free [you get] a faster ride.' He also pledges to lockbox dedicated funding for free service, citing his past work on MTA rescue packages. Mamdani and his allies point to a recent free bus pilot that increased ridership and reduced assaults. The proposal, if enacted, would shift street space from cars to buses, aiming to make public transit safer and more reliable for all riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons.
