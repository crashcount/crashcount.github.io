Use Sammy’s Law to lower the default speed limit to 20 mph across the city.

The push comes ahead of the next budget cycle. Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Amanda Septimo, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher led the call. Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warned that cuts or fare hikes would devastate working- and middle-class New Yorkers.

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, launched to comply with a 2019 law, mandates 150 miles of protected bus lanes by 2026—20 miles in 2022 alone. With two months left, only 5.4 miles were finished. González-Rojas declared, 'We demand to get our 20 miles of bus lanes.' The rally took place on Northern Boulevard, a corridor scarred by pedestrian deaths, including 9-year-old Giovanni Ampuero. His father spoke out: 'If you don’t improve the street, people are going to still get killed.' The Department of Transportation claims progress and a $900 million investment, but the pace lags. The city’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as deadly streets remain unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On October 26, 2022, the MTA announced legal cycling on the Cross Bay Bridge, with sharrows painted on the path. The Henry Hudson Bridge will open to cyclists after a major renovation, expected by 2025. The MTA will award a contract for that work next year. Gonzalez-Rojas said, 'This is what we worked toward when...we introduced and passed the MTA Bike Access bill.' Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt called the move 'pretty good progress.' The MTA also plans to add bike parking at 37 subway stations and expand bike access near transit. The Verrazzano Bridge remains off-limits for now. The announcement marks a step forward, but cyclists still face barriers and delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
