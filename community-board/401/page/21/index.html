Critics, including Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, countered that Adams canceled or stalled key projects like Fordham Road, despite strong community support. Mamdani said, 'he's made 1.4 million daily bus riders take the slowest buses in the country.' The mayor’s promises remain unmet.

The facts cut through the claim. In 2022, only 12.9 miles of bus lanes were built out of a required 20. In 2023, just 13.3 miles out of a required 30. The Department of Transportation missed legal targets both years. The matter, as reported, states: 'Mayor Adams claimed... his administration has done an "amazing job" building bus lanes... despite missing legally required targets.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, representing District 36, slammed the mayor for scrapping key projects and failing bus riders. Mamdani said, '49 percent of bus riders are dissatisfied with wait times... instead he's made 1.4 million daily bus riders take the slowest buses in the country.' Riders Alliance joined the criticism, demanding a real plan for the 130 miles of overdue bus lanes. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed, with no clear agenda for safer, faster streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, which would let New York City control its own speed limits, stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refused to allow a vote, despite majority support. Brooklyn Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, a strong supporter, noted, 'Even [lawmakers] who had City Council members from their districts supporting the bill were still not interested.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.' City data shows a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit reduction. The bill remains in limbo, but advocates are not backing down.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
