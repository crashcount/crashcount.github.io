The dead include children, cyclists, elders. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just last fall, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was struck and killed in Astoria. She was riding home from a cycling event. A pickup, fleeing police, hit her at the intersection of 37th Street and 34th Avenue. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>A father mourned. <strong>&ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood,&rdquo;</strong> he <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-no-end-in-sight>The Pattern: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not slow. In the last year alone, three more people died. <strong>Children, teens, adults—all struck down.</strong> Hundreds more were hurt. The killers are cars, SUVs, trucks, mopeds.

Council Member Tiffany Cabán <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop the real danger—drivers who do not yield. Cabán also co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>backed the 31st Street protected bike lane plan</a>, a proven way to save lives.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. <strong>Every day without change is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and a 20 mph speed limit.</strong> Demand that leaders act before another family gets the call. The dead do not get a second chance. The living must not wait.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brooklyn Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, a strong supporter, noted, 'Even [lawmakers] who had City Council members from their districts supporting the bill were still not interested.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.' City data shows a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit reduction.

She suffered a broken arm and bruises. The driver received a summons for failure to yield. González-Rojas called the intersection dangerous, citing poor visibility and lack of daylighting. She stated, "If we had universal daylighting—he could have seen me." González-Rojas renewed her push for Sammy’s Law, which would let New York City set speed limits below 25 mph, and called for more protected bike lanes. She said, "I absolutely had the right of way. He just turned right into me—and the next thing you know I was on the floor."

The toll’s impact on safety goes unmentioned.</p><p class=mb3>On December 3, 2023, partisan lines hardened over New York’s congestion pricing law. The $15 toll, set to hit drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street, became a political weapon. State Sen. Michael Gianaris, mentioned in the debate, dismissed Republican attacks as ineffective. The measure, approved in 2019 by Democrats, aims to raise $1 billion for mass transit and reduce traffic. GOP figures like Nicole Malliotakis and Michael Lawler call it a 'burdensome tax' and 'outrageous cash grab.' Mayor Eric Adams seeks exemptions for medical trips. The bill’s matter title frames it as a major election issue: 'NY GOP eager to pin $15 congestion tax on Democrats in 2024 elections.' No safety analyst has assessed its impact on vulnerable road users.

Two lanes each way remain. Bike lanes go unprotected. Crossing distances stretch. Local leaders say nothing changed for people on foot. Cyclists dodge cars and illegal parking. The danger stays. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On November 29, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams’s administration scaled back the Department of Transportation’s original McGuinness Boulevard redesign. The DOT’s first plan would have cut traffic lanes and added a parking-protected bike lane. Adams ordered a weaker version after business pushback. The compromise left two car lanes in each direction during the day. Elected officials—U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and Council Member Lincoln Restler—sent a letter urging DOT to restore the full safety plan, writing, “Nothing has been done to improve conditions for pedestrians.” Advocates say the new design increases crossing distances and leaves cyclists and pedestrians exposed. DOT says work will continue into 2024. The boulevard remains dangerous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
