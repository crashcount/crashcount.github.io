Council Member Tiffany Cabán and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani have called for safer streets, but the default speed limit is still too high. Each delay is another risk.

The policy reversal, covered by Gothamist, sparked outrage among transit advocates and progressives. Hochul claimed, 'We need to make sure our solutions work for everyone, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet.' Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani condemned the move as 'political malpractice.' Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, District 23, was mentioned in coverage but did not take a direct action.

The bill now heads to the Assembly.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill, sponsored by Sen. Liz Kruger (D-Manhattan), passed on June 3, 2024. It doubles fines for unauthorized moped dealers from $1,000 to $2,000 and requires registration at the point of sale. The bill is expected to pass the Assembly, where Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas co-sponsors. The matter summary states: 'Fines against unauthorized moped dealers would be doubled.' Kruger said, 'My bill makes sure we know who is selling mopeds.' González-Rojas added, 'The bill will help alleviate some of the challenges we see around mopeds.' Advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project support enforcement at the point of sale, noting many dealers are unlicensed. The bill targets vendors, not riders, aiming to protect vulnerable delivery workers and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
