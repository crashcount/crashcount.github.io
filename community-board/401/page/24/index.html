No formal council bill number is listed, but the Transportation Committee of Community Board 1 passed a resolution urging DOT to daylight all intersections. The matter, described as 'community advocacy for street safety and bike infrastructure,' drew over 150 residents to a public workshop. Council Member Zohran Kwame Mamdani attended, stating, 'Astorians showed up last night for pedestrian + bike safety.' Online organizing, especially on the MicromobilityNYC subreddit, brought new voices to the table and pressured NYPD to take traffic enforcement seriously. The area lacks protected bike lanes—only 3 percent of streets have them—while most residents do not own cars and rely on walking, biking, or transit. The activism is diverse, persistent, and focused on ending traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot, part of a state budget deal, makes one route per borough fare-free for up to a year. The official summary states: 'One MTA bus route will be free in each New York City borough starting Sunday.' Queens Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, mentioned in the coverage, said, 'Getting more New Yorkers on to public transit must be at the forefront of our plan for a greener NY.' The pilot covers the B60 in Brooklyn, M116 in Manhattan, Q4 in Queens, S46/S96 in Staten Island, and BX18 in the Bronx. About 44,000 weekday riders are affected. The MTA will monitor ridership and study the impact. Progressive lawmakers back the move to help low-income New Yorkers.
