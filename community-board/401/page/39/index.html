Last week, an 84-year-old driver sped through a stop sign at 19th Avenue and 42nd Street in Astoria. The car hit two men waiting for coffee. Both died. The driver died too. Witnesses said the car was &ldquo;going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people have died and over 1,000 have been injured on these streets. Six suffered injuries so severe they may never walk right again. The dead are not numbers. They are brothers, fathers, neighbors. &ldquo;He was always happy. He would make you happy. He would make happy any person in the world,&rdquo; said a victim’s brother (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-speed-and-steel>The Pattern: Speed and Steel</h3><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. In this district, SUVs and sedans alone have taken two lives and injured hundreds. Trucks and buses have killed one and hurt dozens more. Bikes and mopeds injure, but the carnage comes on four wheels. The numbers do not lie: 16 deaths, 3,014 injuries, 21 left with life-changing wounds since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leaders-words-votes-and-waiting>Leaders: Words, Votes, and Waiting</h3><p>After the latest crash, local leaders spoke. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani called for &ldquo;the acceleration of the adoption of Sammy&rsquo;s Law and has proposed a plan to limit car traffic outside our schools&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Council Member Tiffany Cabán demanded a 20 mph limit and more daylight at corners. Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes to curb repeat speeders with speed-limiting tech (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</p><p>But the street stays the same. The speed stays the same. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day the city delays a 20 mph limit, another family risks losing someone. Every day without real enforcement, the same drivers speed by. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its power to slow the streets and save lives.</p><p>Do not wait for another body on the pavement. Demand action now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, backed by Governor Hochul and legislative leaders, broadens enforcement to drivers blocking bus stops, truck loading zones, bike lanes, intersections, and crosswalks. Fines start at $50, escalating for repeat offenses. The MTA will increase buses with cameras from 450 to 1,000 by year's end. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and advocate Sara Lind support the move, calling it vital for bus reliability and street safety. Lind says, 'Camera-based enforcement is such a powerful tool for making our streets safer.' The budget also addresses MTA funding, but some, like Mamdani, criticize the city's increased financial burden. The bill aims to clear the way for buses and vulnerable road users, reducing dangerous blockages.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot is a key piece of the 'Fix the MTA' package. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, a main sponsor, celebrated the inclusion of free buses, stating, 'I’m excited that the vision of free buses from our Fix the MTA package has been included in this year’s budget.' The pilot aims to increase bus ridership and keep fares low, while new funding measures—like a payroll mobility tax and increased city contributions—shore up the MTA’s finances. The plan also promises more frequent subway service and avoids steep fare hikes or service cuts. The official cost of the pilot is not yet clear, but advocates and officials say it will keep the MTA stable for four years.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan is part of the 'Fix the MTA' package, originally championed by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and progressive allies. Adams said, 'I strongly support the thought of having 10 buses being free on lines in the city. I think it would make a major impact.' Mamdani called free buses 'transformative' for working-class New Yorkers. Despite this, other bus improvements lag. Adams pledged 150 miles of new bus lanes in four years, but only 11.95 miles were built last year. Some projects stalled amid political opposition. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber stressed the need for city commitment to bus lanes and warned of fare hikes and service cuts if funding gaps persist.

The proposal, championed by Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani and supported by Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, is tangled in state budget negotiations. The Assembly and Senate included the pilot in their responses to Governor Hochul’s executive budget, but the governor’s plan left it out. The pilot would select two routes per borough, one serving a low-income area and one a commercial corridor. 'I strongly support the thought of having ten buses being free. The lines in the city I think will make a major impact,' Adams said. Mamdani called free buses 'a huge win for working-class NYers.' The plan’s fate remains uncertain as Albany’s budget talks drag on.
