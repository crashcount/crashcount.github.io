She also backed bills for protected bike lanes and daylighting crosswalks. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez and others supported new protected bike lanes on 31st Street, over the loud objections of some business owners (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>protected bike lanes on 31st Street</a>).</p><p>But the streets are still deadly.

The agency seeks public input. Sam Schwartz Engineering will draft the plan. New bike parking appears at Grand Central. Permit rules ease on commuter trains. Advocates push for more. History shows slow progress.</p><p class=mb3>On May 27, 2022, the MTA announced a strategic action plan to improve bicycle, pedestrian, and micromobility access to its trains and facilities. This follows a state bill signed last year mandating better conditions for cyclists. The plan, still in development, aims to create 'equitable access to the transit system and support sustainable transportation modes.' MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber said, 'We want to improve customer access to our environmentally friendly MTA services, however they get to their train or bus.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas called bridge access 'a matter of environmental justice, public health, and labor justice.' The MTA has ended bike permits on LIRR and Metro-North and added bike parking at Grand Central, but its record on bike access remains mixed. The agency is now seeking public comment and has hired Sam Schwartz Engineering to help shape the plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable users got no new shield.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0293-2022 was introduced on April 28, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to require the Department of Transportation to create a program letting community centers, schools, arts and cultural institutions, and religious institutions use adjacent outdoor spaces. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law...requiring the department of transportation to establish a program to allow community centers, schools, arts and cultural institutions and religious institutions to use adjacent outdoor spaces.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Stevens, Hanif, Avilés, and others. The bill required a permit process, a site safety plan, and compliance with local rules. It was filed at session's end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst weighed in. The bill died, leaving streets unchanged for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
