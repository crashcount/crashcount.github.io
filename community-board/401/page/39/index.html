The bill sought to "prohibit the issuance of private vehicle parking permits and revoke such existing permits," with exceptions for people with disabilities and collective bargaining agreements. Council Member Christopher Marte led as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Brewer, Joseph, Nurse, Cabán, Avilés, Bottcher, Won, Ossé, and Richardson Jordan, plus the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aimed to end a system that let private cars claim curb space, fueling illegal parking and danger for those on foot or bike. It was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. The status quo remains: permits still shield drivers, while vulnerable road users face the risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This follows a state bill signed last year mandating better conditions for cyclists. The plan, still in development, aims to create 'equitable access to the transit system and support sustainable transportation modes.' MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber said, 'We want to improve customer access to our environmentally friendly MTA services, however they get to their train or bus.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas called bridge access 'a matter of environmental justice, public health, and labor justice.' The MTA has ended bike permits on LIRR and Metro-North and added bike parking at Grand Central, but its record on bike access remains mixed. The agency is now seeking public comment and has hired Sam Schwartz Engineering to help shape the plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
