The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> Council Member Tiffany Cabán co-sponsored the law that ended jaywalking tickets, shifting blame away from pedestrians and back to drivers (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legislation to end jaywalking tickets</a>). She also backed bills for protected bike lanes and daylighting crosswalks. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez and others supported new protected bike lanes on 31st Street, over the loud objections of some business owners (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>protected bike lanes on 31st Street</a>).</p><p>But the streets are still deadly. Promises do not stop cars. <strong>Every delay means another family waits for a knock at the door.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and enforcement that targets reckless drivers—not the people they hit.

The article, published October 28, 2024, details community outrage after a cyclist’s death and repeated injuries. NYPD policy says chases should end when risk outweighs reward, but enforcement fails. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. Comptroller Brad Lander says, 'Drivers who are repeatedly caught by speed and red-light cameras currently face no consequences other than a fine in the mail. Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.' State Senator Michael Gianaris calls for stronger penalties, including suspending registrations. The NYPD has not adopted reforms. Residents and advocates demand legislative action and transparency. Without it, vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
