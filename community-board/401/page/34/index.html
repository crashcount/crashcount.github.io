Twenty-one left with serious wounds.</strong> In just over three years, Queens CB1 has seen 5,229 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.

He was ejected, helmet on, dead at the scene. The crash involved an SUV. The cause: <strong>&ldquo;Traffic Control Disregarded&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

The bus driver did nothing wrong. The street did not care.</p><p>A 17-year-old boy died as a passenger on Astoria Boulevard. The car was speeding. The record says: &ldquo;Unsafe Speed.&rdquo; The boy is gone.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. Council Member Tiffany Cabán voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She co-sponsored bills for more protected bike lanes and to ban parking near crosswalks. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The street is faster.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and enforcement against reckless drivers—not against people on foot or bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable New Yorkers wait for answers.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul delivered her State of the State address but failed to outline a plan to fill the MTA’s $600 million operating deficit. The event, covered in 'Hochul punts on new MTA revenue source amid threat of big fare hikes,' saw Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani (District 36) publicly criticize the lack of specifics, warning, 'In her silence on addressing the MTA’s operating deficit, Gov. Hochul leaves the possibility of fare hikes and service cuts on the table.' The MTA faces steep fare increases and possible service cuts if new funding is not secured. Hochul announced plans to rezone for more housing near transit to boost ridership, but offered no immediate relief. The absence of a concrete funding plan leaves vulnerable riders—those who depend on transit—at risk. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street, a DOT truck route, lacks bike lanes. Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in western Queens in under three years. Former Councilmember Costa Constantinides called the area a 'serious safety risk' and urged the DOT to study improvements and reroute trucks. Cabán called the crash 'devastating' and pressed city agencies for action. DOT spokesman Vin Barone promised immediate steps at the crash site and talks on protected bike lanes. Less than 1.5 percent of streets in Council District 22 have protected bike paths. Residents say the city prioritizes highway access over safety. The city plans to add leading pedestrian intervals at the intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Peak hour cuts, longer waits. Riders and workers brace for frustration. Advocates and lawmakers push Albany to fill the gap. The board’s budget opens the door to fare hikes and more pain.</p><p class=mb3>On December 22, 2022, MTA leaders announced that without recurring state funding, service cuts are inevitable. The MTA Board approved a 2023 budget allowing fare hikes and service changes, pending Albany’s action. Chairman Janno Lieber said, "All good things can happen if people are willing to pay for them, or help figure out recurring funding sources, which is what MTA needs to achieve fiscal stability." New York City Transit President Richard Davey explained that peak hour service would be trimmed, with modest increases in wait times, while some weekend service would expand. Transit advocates and union leaders, including Richard Davis, condemned the cuts, warning of increased rider frustration and assaults on workers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani urged passage of bills to freeze fares and fill the MTA’s fiscal gap, stating, "We have to fix the rot at the heart of the transit system." No formal safety analyst assessment was provided, but the debate centers on the risk to riders and workers if service shrinks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
