Twenty seriously hurt. Over 2,700 injured.</strong> That’s the count in Queens CB1 since 2022. Each number is a body on the street, a family left waiting. The dead do not speak. The living remember.</p><p>Just months ago, a cyclist was struck and killed at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. She was coming home from a ride. The driver was fleeing police, tearing through the neighborhood. A witness said, &ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>. The chase ended. She did not come home.</p><p>A few blocks away, a pickup slammed into a parked car. A passenger bled out in the seat. On Astoria Boulevard, a BMW turned and crushed a pedestrian. The sidewalk was quiet again by morning. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed two people and injured nearly 400 more on these streets. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds left bodies broken. Even bikes, squeezed into traffic, added to the toll. No one is safe when the street is built for speed.</p><p>The city counts the bodies. The city counts the crashes. But the city does not count the cost to the living.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-or-excuses>Leaders: Action or Excuses?</h3><p>Some leaders have stepped up. Council Member Tiffany Cabán voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame off pedestrians and onto the drivers who kill, according to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>. She co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez backed the 31st Street protected bike lane plan, calling it a way to &ldquo;protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested,&rdquo; as reported by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But progress crawls. Promises pile up. The street stays the same. The next crash waits around the corner.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected bike lanes, not just paint. Demand a 20 mph speed limit for every block. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible.

Advocates and Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas rally on Northern Boulevard. Only 5.4 miles built, far short of the 20-mile goal. The city stalls. Streets stay deadly. Families mourn. The clock runs out.</p><p class=mb3>On November 1, 2022, Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas joined advocates in Jackson Heights to demand faster bus lane construction under the New York City Streets Plan. The plan, launched to comply with a 2019 law, mandates 150 miles of protected bus lanes by 2026—20 miles in 2022 alone. With two months left, only 5.4 miles were finished. González-Rojas declared, 'We demand to get our 20 miles of bus lanes.' The rally took place on Northern Boulevard, a corridor scarred by pedestrian deaths, including 9-year-old Giovanni Ampuero. His father spoke out: 'If you don’t improve the street, people are going to still get killed.' The Department of Transportation claims progress and a $900 million investment, but the pace lags. The city’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as deadly streets remain unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Henry Hudson Bridge will open to cyclists after a major renovation, expected by 2025. The MTA will award a contract for that work next year. Gonzalez-Rojas said, 'This is what we worked toward when...we introduced and passed the MTA Bike Access bill.' Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt called the move 'pretty good progress.' The MTA also plans to add bike parking at 37 subway stations and expand bike access near transit. The Verrazzano Bridge remains off-limits for now.
