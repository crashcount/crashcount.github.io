Peak hour cuts, longer waits. Riders and workers brace for frustration. Advocates and lawmakers push Albany to fill the gap. The board’s budget opens the door to fare hikes and more pain.</p><p class=mb3>On December 22, 2022, MTA leaders announced that without recurring state funding, service cuts are inevitable. The MTA Board approved a 2023 budget allowing fare hikes and service changes, pending Albany’s action. Chairman Janno Lieber said, "All good things can happen if people are willing to pay for them, or help figure out recurring funding sources, which is what MTA needs to achieve fiscal stability." New York City Transit President Richard Davey explained that peak hour service would be trimmed, with modest increases in wait times, while some weekend service would expand. Transit advocates and union leaders, including Richard Davis, condemned the cuts, warning of increased rider frustration and assaults on workers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani urged passage of bills to freeze fares and fill the MTA’s fiscal gap, stating, "We have to fix the rot at the heart of the transit system." No formal safety analyst assessment was provided, but the debate centers on the risk to riders and workers if service shrinks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
