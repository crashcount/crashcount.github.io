State Sen. Michael Gianaris and advocates demand swift action. They want signals, not studies. The city waits for blood before it moves. Residents, tired of carnage, rally for change. The toll mounts.</p><p class=mb3>On August 17, 2022, State Senator Michael Gianaris called for urgent pedestrian safety improvements after a deadly hit-and-run in Queens. The incident, which killed 74-year-old Be Tran at Myrtle and Seneca Avenues, triggered public outcry. Gianaris criticized the city’s process, saying, 'They have to wait until that happens to get the score high enough to realize that an intersection needs protection.' He joined activists from the Ridgewood Tenants Union and Transportation Alternatives, demanding new signals and better street design. Gianaris said he contacted the Department of Transportation a year earlier with no result. The city claims over 20 traffic control approvals in Ridgewood, but residents and advocates say it’s not enough. The call comes as pedestrian deaths and injuries continue to climb citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
