Cuomo called for a new city bureaucracy and stricter enforcement, saying, 'There’s virtually no rules and no regulations regarding e-bike use in New York City and too many New Yorkers are getting hurt, and even killed.' At a campaign event, Cuomo called bike lanes 'crazy.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani criticized the plan, warning it would 'increase unwarranted police stops and create a bureaucratic nightmare.' Comptroller Brad Lander said Cuomo's proposal 'puts his failure to govern on the backs of delivery workers.' Safety experts and advocates argue the plan would not improve safety, but instead target delivery workers—many undocumented—while cars and trucks remain the main source of road violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter title states: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation that would require the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide free express bus fare to New York City students who take express buses to and from school.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers is the primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Justin L. Brannan, Shahana K. Hanif, Kamillah Hanks, and Tiffany Cabán. The bill highlights the steep $7 express bus fare, which leaves students in transit deserts with few safe, affordable options.

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment.

Cameras will catch drivers who invade space meant for cyclists. The bill targets scofflaws, not victims. Streets stay deadly when lanes fill with steel. Lawmakers want clear paths, not carnage.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 5008, now in the sponsorship stage, aims to establish a bicycle lane safety program in New York City. The bill, introduced on February 18, 2025, sits before the Senate. Its summary reads: 'Establishes in the city of New York a bicycle lane safety program to enforce certain restrictions on the use of bicycle lanes and/or protected bicycle lanes by means of bicycle lane photo devices.' Brad Hoylman-Sigal leads as primary sponsor, joined by Jabari Brisport, Kristen Gonzalez, Liz Krueger, Jessica Ramos, and Julia Salazar as co-sponsors. These lawmakers seek to use automated cameras to enforce bike lane rules, targeting drivers who endanger cyclists by blocking protected lanes. The bill does not blame victims. It focuses on driver behavior and systemic enforcement to keep vulnerable road users safe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
