Queens Streets Are Killing Us—And Leaders Are Dodging Responsibility</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 14, 2025</p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Queens CB1: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 14, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-toll-on-our-streets>The Toll on Our Streets</h3><p><strong>Three dead. Six seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, Queens CB1 saw 803 crashes. Two people did not make it home. Four more survived but will never be the same. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A 35-year-old died on her bike at 34th Avenue and 37th Street. A 15-year-old on a moped was killed at 43rd Street and 19th Avenue. A 17-year-old lost his life as a passenger on Astoria Boulevard. These are not numbers. They are names, faces, families, futures.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-no-end-in-sight>The Pattern: No End in Sight</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed two people and injured 399 more. Trucks and buses left 23 hurt. Motorcycles and mopeds, 27. Bikes, 15. The violence is steady. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The bike lane is not safe. &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said Samantha Hart</a> after a bus jumped the curb in Queens, injuring eight. The bus driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. &ldquo;After investigators downloaded video from the bus&rsquo;s onboard cameras, it is now believed he had fallen asleep at the wheel,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>reported ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some wait.</strong> Council Member Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas backed new protected bike lanes on 31st Street, calling them a way to &ldquo;protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>DOT stands by the plan</a>. But other bills—like the SAFE Streets Act and daylighting at crosswalks—sit in committee. Each day of delay is another day of risk. Each crash is a policy failure, not fate.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not an act of God. It is a choice.</strong> Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted crosswalks. Demand action, not condolences. The next name could be yours.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation had planned a ribbon-cutting for March 16, but Mayor Adams canceled it. Council Member Julie Won and State Senator Michael Gianaris attended, both supporting the reconfiguration. Won said, 'I have received no new information since Mayor Adams canceled the March 16 ribbon-cutting.' The protest highlighted the ongoing crisis: nine lanes for cars, one narrow, shared lane for cyclists and pedestrians. Crashes and near-misses are common. City Hall claims the project will impact several communities, but offers no timeline. The lane reverted to car use after the protest, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The poll surveyed 854 likely voters. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, who has championed free bus service since 2020, celebrated the results, saying, 'We know from our historic pilot program that free buses work: more riders, safer trips, cleaner air.' The MTA previously ran free bus pilots, reporting increased ridership and fewer operator assaults, though the agency questioned whether new riders joined.
