Since 2022, <strong>16 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>Twenty-one more were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same</strong>. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. In the last twelve months alone, five more lives were lost—a cyclist, a pedestrian, a teenager on a moped. Each one gone. Each one a hole in a family that will not close.</p><h2 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>Just this year, a 39-year-old man was killed at 23rd Avenue and 37th Street.

The bill targets those who rack up violations, aiming to cut risk for everyone on the street. Gonzalez <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes in committee, boosting street safety by curbing repeat speeders</a>.</p><p>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani has called for bus and bike lanes, for moving traffic enforcement out of the NYPD, and for putting the most vulnerable first. As Mamdani said, &ldquo;The merit that we are measuring these projects by is whether or not they deliver for working class New Yorkers who are currently taking the slowest buses in the country.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/mamdani-promises-new-path-for-bus-projects-as-mta-leader-finally-loses-patience-with-mayor-adams>Mamdani promises a new path for bus projects</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming.

Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes.

The bill states, 'it shall be a defense to any prosecution for a violation of a bus lane restriction ... when an employee of the metropolitan transportation authority is performing authorized duties.' Sponsored by Senator Leroy Comrie and co-sponsored by Nathalia Fernandez, the measure exempts MTA employees from bus lane tickets while working. No safety analysis was provided. The bill opens bus lanes to more agency vehicles, crowding space meant for buses, cyclists, and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
