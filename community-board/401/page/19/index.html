Last week, an 84-year-old driver sped through a stop sign at 19th Avenue and 42nd Street in Astoria. The car hit two men waiting for coffee. Both died. The driver died too. Witnesses said the car was &ldquo;going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people have died and over 1,000 have been injured on these streets. Six suffered injuries so severe they may never walk right again. The dead are not numbers. They are brothers, fathers, neighbors. &ldquo;He was always happy. He would make you happy. He would make happy any person in the world,&rdquo; said a victim’s brother (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-speed-and-steel>The Pattern: Speed and Steel</h3><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. In this district, SUVs and sedans alone have taken two lives and injured hundreds. Trucks and buses have killed one and hurt dozens more. Bikes and mopeds injure, but the carnage comes on four wheels. The numbers do not lie: 16 deaths, 3,014 injuries, 21 left with life-changing wounds since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leaders-words-votes-and-waiting>Leaders: Words, Votes, and Waiting</h3><p>After the latest crash, local leaders spoke. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani called for &ldquo;the acceleration of the adoption of Sammy&rsquo;s Law and has proposed a plan to limit car traffic outside our schools&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Council Member Tiffany Cabán demanded a 20 mph limit and more daylight at corners. Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes to curb repeat speeders with speed-limiting tech (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</p><p>But the street stays the same. The speed stays the same. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day the city delays a 20 mph limit, another family risks losing someone. Every day without real enforcement, the same drivers speed by. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its power to slow the streets and save lives.</p><p>Do not wait for another body on the pavement. Demand action now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The pause threatens subway and bus service. Advocates demand any replacement funds boost operations, not highways.

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities.

This action fulfills a mandate from the 2021 MTA Bike Access bill. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, who sponsored the law, said, "I'm excited about the ADA-accessible ramp on the Cross Bay Bridge and that cyclists and pedestrians can access this space... because we passed my legislation." The MTA also announced similar improvements for the Henry Hudson and Triboro Bridges. However, plans for the Verrazzano, Gil Hodges-Marine Parkway, Bronx-Whitestone, and Throgs Neck bridges remain uncertain. Cycling advocates praised the MTA’s progress but criticized its reluctance to consider lane conversions for safer, broader access.

Vast majority go to people of color.' Cabán, a key sponsor, argued police use jaywalking as a pretext for stop-and-frisk, calling the law archaic and motorist-centered.
