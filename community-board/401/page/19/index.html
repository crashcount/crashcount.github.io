Sponsors say the current policy punishes those with the hardest commutes.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0252-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced March 7, 2024, it urges Albany to pass and sign a law creating unlimited subway and bus transfers within two hours for pay-per-ride users. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation, which would create unlimited transfers within the two-hour period of paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority subway or bus fare for pay-per-ride users.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez leads as primary sponsor, joined by Riley, Stevens, Hanif, Won, Feliz, Salaam, Hanks, Farías, De La Rosa, Cabán, Williams, Hudson, Ung, Ossé, Banks, and Holden. The sponsors argue the current one-transfer rule hits hardest for riders with long, complex trips, often in transit deserts. They demand fare equity for all, not just those with short, easy rides.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced February 28, 2024, it amends city law to require the Department of Transportation to expand Open Streets hours on holidays with heavy foot traffic. The bill’s summary reads: 'special activation of the Open Streets program on certain holidays and time periods with significant pedestrian traffic.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Brooks-Powers, Louis, Nurse, Ossé, Sanchez, Cabán, Banks, Avilés, Riley, Salaam, Hanif, Feliz, Won, Restler, and Joseph. The bill directs DOT to seek community input for more activation days. Applications for these special activations follow the same review as regular Open Streets. The measure aims to give pedestrians and cyclists more space and time, cutting car risk when crowds surge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle," forces the NYPD to add 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a specific reporting category in quarterly and annual use of force reports. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Won, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Avilés, Abreu, Ossé, Krishnan, Williams, Cabán, Nurse, Sanchez, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force. This change brings police violence by car into the light, exposing patterns that endanger pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
