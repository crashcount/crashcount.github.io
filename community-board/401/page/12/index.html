In Queens CB1, the numbers pile up. <strong>Thirteen people killed. Twenty seriously hurt. Over 2,700 injured.</strong> Each number is a name, a family, a life split open. The dead include children, cyclists, elders. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just last fall, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was struck and killed in Astoria. She was riding home from a cycling event. A pickup, fleeing police, hit her at the intersection of 37th Street and 34th Avenue. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>A father mourned. <strong>&ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood,&rdquo;</strong> he <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-no-end-in-sight>The Pattern: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not slow. In the last year alone, three more people died. <strong>Children, teens, adults—all struck down.</strong> Hundreds more were hurt. The killers are cars, SUVs, trucks, mopeds. The wounds are broken bones, crushed skulls, lives erased at the curb.</p><p>The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken. But the city does not stop the blood.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Tiffany Cabán <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop the real danger—drivers who do not yield. Cabán also co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>backed the 31st Street protected bike lane plan</a>, a proven way to save lives.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. <strong>Every day without change is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and a 20 mph speed limit.</strong> Demand that leaders act before another family gets the call. The dead do not get a second chance. The living must not wait.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Chi A. Ossé leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Marte, Hudson, Cabán, Brannan, Hanif, Brewer, and Abreu.

The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee had advanced the bill, but Speaker Adrienne Adams held it back from a full vote, citing ongoing debate. The bill’s summary: ending NYPD tickets for crossing outside crosswalks, a practice disproportionately enforced against New Yorkers of color. Councilmember Tiffany Cabán, a sponsor, condemned the law’s discriminatory impact and its failure to reduce traffic violence. After lawmakers amended the bill to shield drivers from liability in pedestrian crashes, advocates like Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives withdrew support, insisting the law should 'clearly protect [pedestrians’] right to safety and security.' The latest version still exposes jaywalkers to civil suits and mandates a city safety education campaign. The bill’s future is uncertain.

The $368 million project, led by the MTA, replaced century-old signals with Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC), aiming for faster, more reliable service. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) praised the MTA’s handling and shuttle bus communication but criticized the city for not creating dedicated bus lanes during the closure, saying, 'They expressed dismay, however, that the city had not constructed a dedicated lane so shuttle buses could move faster.' Restler called for renewed investment in the MTA, including the resumption of congestion pricing, to fund future upgrades. The project continues through 2027, but no more full shutdowns are planned.
