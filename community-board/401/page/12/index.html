Four seriously hurt.</strong> In the past year alone, Queens CB1 has seen 803 crashes, 458 injuries, and two lives ended on its streets. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement, families left with empty chairs. A 17-year-old passenger, dead in a tangle of sedans on Astoria Boulevard. A 15-year-old moped rider, crushed by a bus on 43rd Street. A cyclist, a pedestrian, a child—none spared by the machinery of the street.</p><h2 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h2><p>After the bus jumped the curb in Flushing, <strong>Jacqueline Cox said,</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus.&rdquo;</a> Eight people hurt. A pole down. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb,&rdquo; but video showed he had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. <strong>&ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said Samantha Hart</a>. The crash could have killed more. It was luck, not policy, that spared them.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-missed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Missed</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> State Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. It <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>passed committee in June</a>. But the carnage continues. Council Member Tiffany Cabán and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani have <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/04/beach-reading-zohran-mamdanis-answers-to-streetsblogs-mayoral-candidate-survey>called for safer streets</a>, but the pace is slow. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst keep driving. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so citywide. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made upstream. Residents must demand more. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states he was unlicensed but wore a helmet. The motorcycle struck the taxi's right front quarter panel, causing the rider to be ejected and thrown onto the roadway. The motorcycle was demolished. The taxi, operated by a licensed driver, stopped after the collision. The police report lists 'Driver Inexperience' as a contributing factor. The rider died at the scene, suffering injuries to his entire body. The report does not cite any contributing victim behavior beyond helmet use.

Assemblymember Robert Carroll pushes for a higher congestion toll, putting it above his own delivery fee plan. Albany stalls. Riders wait. Infrastructure ages. Danger grows for those outside cars.</p><p class=mb3>""The question is whether we have the political will to collect that [tax] and ensure that it's used to transform the lives of working-class New Yorkers,"" -- Zohran Mamdani</p><p class=mb3>On January 31, 2025, the New York City Council debated MTA funding options. Assemblymember Robert Carroll (District 44) voiced support for increasing the congestion toll, stating it should come before his earlier $3 delivery fee proposal. The debate, covered in the article '5 ways the MTA could get the money it needs to fix aging infrastructure,' highlights the lack of consensus among lawmakers. Governor Hochul’s budget falls short. Senate and Assembly leaders have not chosen a revenue source. Carroll’s stance: 'increasing the congestion toll should come first.' Other options—taxing the rich, payroll tax hikes, vice taxes—face resistance. MTA Chair Janno Lieber urges focus on repairs, not expansion. No direct safety analysis was provided, but the delay in funding leaves vulnerable road users exposed to the risks of failing infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
