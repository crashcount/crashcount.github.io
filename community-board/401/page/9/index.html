The bill sits in the New York State Assembly, with Didi Barrett as the primary sponsor and a long list of co-sponsors, including Rebecca Seawright, Amy Paulin, and others. The bill summary reads: 'Requires the consideration of complete street design for certain transportation projects which receive federal or state funding; authorizes the department to compile and make publicly available guidance and reference material related to consideration of complete street design.' This measure would require state and federally funded transportation projects to consider designs that protect all road users, not just drivers. The bill’s broad sponsorship signals growing support for safer, more inclusive streets.

Two sedans traveling westbound were involved. One vehicle, a 2017 Audi, was stopped in traffic when it was struck in the center back end by a 2015 Jeep going straight ahead. The Jeep driver was cited for driver inattention/distraction. The 24-year-old male driver of the Audi suffered a neck injury and contusion but was not ejected and remained conscious, wearing a lap belt.

Streets remain dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On December 6, 2024, a mayoral candidate forum spotlighted New York City's broken bus service. State Senator Zellnor Myrie, representing District 20, called for a dedicated busway on Brooklyn's Flatbush Avenue, echoing the success of Manhattan's 14th Street. The forum, hosted by Riders Alliance, saw candidates—including Myrie, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, and Jim Walden—debate urgent transit reforms. The matter: 'improving NYC's slow bus service.' Myrie and others backed more bus lanes, fare-free buses, and expanding Fair Fares for low-income riders. Mamdani vowed not to cave to local opposition. All criticized Mayor Adams for stalled bus projects. The forum exposed deep frustration with city inaction and highlighted the need for bold, street-level changes to protect riders and speed up commutes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
