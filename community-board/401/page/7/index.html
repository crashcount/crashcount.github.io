Twenty-one seriously injured.</strong> More than 2,800 hurt since 2022. Each number is a body. Each body is a story cut short or broken. In the last twelve months alone: three deaths, six left with life-altering wounds, and <strong>over 850 injured</strong>. The streets do not forgive mistakes. They do not care about intent.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed two, left four with grave injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all add to the count. No one is spared. Not the young, not the old. Not the cyclist, not the pedestrian.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The carnage does not pause. Last October, a woman on a bike was killed at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. She wore a helmet. It did not matter. In June, a 17-year-old died as a passenger in a sedan on Astoria Boulevard. In July, a 39-year-old moped rider was killed at 23rd Avenue and 37th Street. The details are always the same: a body, a street, a vehicle, a family left behind.</p><p>On the bus, no one is safe either. <strong>&ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said Jacqueline Cox</a>, after a Q20 bus jumped the curb and smashed into a pole, injuring seven. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; But video showed he had fallen asleep at the wheel. <strong>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said Ken Baur</a>. Eight people hurt. The MTA pulled the driver from service. The investigation drags on.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h3><p>Local leaders have not been silent. Council Member Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas backed the new protected bike lanes on 31st Street, writing that the lanes would <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>&ldquo;protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested&rdquo;</a>. Cabán has also co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. Senator Gonzalez voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, targeting repeat reckless drivers. But the pace is slow. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another life at risk. Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted intersections. Demand action against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene; no arrests were made as the investigation continued. The article notes that the intersection is a known trouble spot, with Collins stating, "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The report highlights systemic issues: delivery app pressures, lack of regulation, and a street design that encourages risky moves.

Cuomo called for a new city bureaucracy and stricter enforcement, saying, 'There’s virtually no rules and no regulations regarding e-bike use in New York City and too many New Yorkers are getting hurt, and even killed.' At a campaign event, Cuomo called bike lanes 'crazy.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani criticized the plan, warning it would 'increase unwarranted police stops and create a bureaucratic nightmare.' Comptroller Brad Lander said Cuomo's proposal 'puts his failure to govern on the backs of delivery workers.' Safety experts and advocates argue the plan would not improve safety, but instead target delivery workers—many undocumented—while cars and trucks remain the main source of road violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2025, Brooklyn Community Board 1 voted 18-15 to request a 20 mph speed limit for Greenpoint and Williamsburg. The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article notes, 'The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light, prosecutors say.' Pena was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. His license was suspended.
