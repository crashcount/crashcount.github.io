Reports must include the reason for the stop, the level of offense, and demographic details, but no personal identifiers. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and others led the charge. The law aims to expose patterns in police stops and holds officers to account. Reports go online, open to all.

The $15 toll, set to hit drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street, became a political weapon. State Sen. Michael Gianaris, mentioned in the debate, dismissed Republican attacks as ineffective. The measure, approved in 2019 by Democrats, aims to raise $1 billion for mass transit and reduce traffic. GOP figures like Nicole Malliotakis and Michael Lawler call it a 'burdensome tax' and 'outrageous cash grab.' Mayor Eric Adams seeks exemptions for medical trips. The bill’s matter title frames it as a major election issue: 'NY GOP eager to pin $15 congestion tax on Democrats in 2024 elections.' No safety analyst has assessed its impact on vulnerable road users.

Gonzalez said, 'The unchecked growth of large warehouses in neighborhoods across NYC has worsened air quality, noise pollution, and traffic safety for everyday New Yorkers.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, a co-sponsor, highlighted the link between warehouse traffic, pollution, and traffic violence. The Red Hook Business Alliance and community advocates back the bill, citing heavy truck traffic, poor air, and threats to safety in working-class neighborhoods.
