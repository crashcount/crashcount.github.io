The report states the teen was 'unlicensed and bareheaded' when he struck the bus and was ejected from his motorscooter, suffering fatal head injuries. The bus, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and was struck on its right front bumper. The police report lists the boy as unlicensed and not wearing any safety equipment. Contributing factors are marked as 'Unspecified' in the report. The narrative emphasizes the severity of the impact and the absence of a helmet, but does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor before listing the lack of helmet use. The focus remains on the systemic dangers present when young, unlicensed individuals operate motor vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
