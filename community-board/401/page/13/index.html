Modern signals promise speed, but funding future hangs in balance.</p><p class=mb3>On September 3, 2024, the G train returned to full service after a summer shutdown for signal modernization. The $368 million project, led by the MTA, replaced century-old signals with Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC), aiming for faster, more reliable service. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) praised the MTA’s handling and shuttle bus communication but criticized the city for not creating dedicated bus lanes during the closure, saying, 'They expressed dismay, however, that the city had not constructed a dedicated lane so shuttle buses could move faster.' Restler called for renewed investment in the MTA, including the resumption of congestion pricing, to fund future upgrades. The project continues through 2027, but no more full shutdowns are planned. The lack of bus lanes during the outage left vulnerable riders exposed to slow, crowded streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, a strong proponent, pushed for more funding but faced MTA opposition. He said, 'When you see fare evasion at levels of 48%, that speaks to an economic issue where working-class New Yorkers are being priced out of public transit.' The pilot saw weekday ridership jump 35% and assaults on drivers drop 39% on free routes. Despite these gains, the state did not renew funding.

Nydia Velázquez supported a permanent plaza. Katie Denny Horowitz of the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance vowed to keep pushing for full-time closure. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno said the agency is working with residents on a long-term vision. Most local households rely on transit, biking, or walking.

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when a 2010 Honda SUV, traveling northeast and making a left turn, struck her with its left front bumper. The report cites the driver's failure to yield right-of-way as a contributing factor. The pedestrian sustained head injuries and whiplash but remained conscious. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally. No contributing factors related to the pedestrian's behavior were noted beyond the driver's failure to yield.
