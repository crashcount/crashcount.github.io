Use Sammy’s Law to lower the default speed limit to 20 mph across the city.

The report details that the bike’s front wheel impacted her leg, causing severe lacerations to her knee and lower leg. The victim remained conscious but was left bleeding on the asphalt.

The victim was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal, but the report explicitly lists driver inattention and obstructed view as primary causes.

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In its place: a wide, gentle slope. Pedestrians, cyclists, wheelchair users now cross safely. The upgrade, forced by a 2021 law, marks progress. But other bridges still leave vulnerable users stranded. Advocates demand more.</p><p class=mb3>On September 25, 2024, the MTA completed a major upgrade to the Cross Bay Bridge, replacing its hazardous Rockaway-side ramp with a wider, ADA-compliant path. This action fulfills a mandate from the 2021 MTA Bike Access bill. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, who sponsored the law, said, "I'm excited about the ADA-accessible ramp on the Cross Bay Bridge and that cyclists and pedestrians can access this space... because we passed my legislation." The MTA also announced similar improvements for the Henry Hudson and Triboro Bridges. However, plans for the Verrazzano, Gil Hodges-Marine Parkway, Bronx-Whitestone, and Throgs Neck bridges remain uncertain. Cycling advocates praised the MTA’s progress but criticized its reluctance to consider lane conversions for safer, broader access. The new ramp removes a deadly barrier, but the fight for safe passage on all city bridges continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
