Since 2022, <strong>16 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>Twenty-one more were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same</strong>. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. In the last twelve months alone, five more lives were lost—a cyclist, a pedestrian, a teenager on a moped. Each one gone. Each one a hole in a family that will not close.</p><h2 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>Just this year, a 39-year-old man was killed at 23rd Avenue and 37th Street. He was thrown from his moped. The SUV kept going. The man did not get up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On Ditmars Boulevard, a bus struck a 53-year-old woman crossing at the intersection.

She did not.</p><p>A 15-year-old boy, unlicensed, riding a moped, was hit by a bus on 19th Avenue. He was ejected. He died.

The bill targets those who rack up violations, aiming to cut risk for everyone on the street. Gonzalez <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes in committee, boosting street safety by curbing repeat speeders</a>.</p><p>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani has called for bus and bike lanes, for moving traffic enforcement out of the NYPD, and for putting the most vulnerable first. As Mamdani said, &ldquo;The merit that we are measuring these projects by is whether or not they deliver for working class New Yorkers who are currently taking the slowest buses in the country.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/mamdani-promises-new-path-for-bus-projects-as-mta-leader-finally-loses-patience-with-mayor-adams>Mamdani promises a new path for bus projects</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming.

Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are taken off the road.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another day for the next siren, the next family shattered.

The Streets Master Plan requires 30 new miles of bus lanes each year. In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles—just 17 percent of the legal mandate. Rodriguez claimed, “We are doing a great job,” citing national comparisons and blaming delays on community board processes and local opposition, especially around the 96th Street project. State Sen. Jessica Ramos, Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, and State Sen. Zellnor Myrie condemned the city’s self-praise and legal failure.

The matter summary reads: 'NYC mayoral candidates participated in a transit-focused forum... discussing congestion pricing, subway safety, and transit upgrades.' Zellnor Myrie, representing District 20, criticized Mayor Adams for not defending congestion pricing and promised to support it regardless of federal politics. Ramos pushed for congestion pricing revenue to fund the MTA. Stringer called for bus expansion and DOT reform. Walden wanted more police and exemptions for seniors and disabled riders.

The Council may weaken the plan by creating a three-tiered system, risking fewer new homes. Mayoral challengers Zellnor Myrie, Brad Lander, Scott Stringer, Jessica Ramos, and Zohran Mamdani—all Democrats—strongly support the original plan. Myrie urges, 'resist efforts to revise the proposal in any way that would yield fewer homes.' Lander calls for ending exclusionary zoning and prioritizing housing over parking. Stringer calls the plan a 'small step.' Mamdani opposes changes that reduce housing or water down parking elimination. Ramos would vote yes but wants to protect neighborhood character.
