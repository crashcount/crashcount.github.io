A 14-year-old girl and a 58-year-old man were struck down beside her. The driver did not have a license. She reversed into a box truck, then spun onto the curb in front of Our World Neighborhood Charter School. Police charged her with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, and driving without a license. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>&ldquo;An out-of-control unlicensed driver rammed into two kids and one adult,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><p>A 94-year-old woman was pinned beneath a USPS van as she crossed Broadway at 48th Street.
