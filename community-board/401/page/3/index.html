Use Sammy’s Law to lower the default speed limit to 20 mph across the city.

Both drivers, a 62-year-old woman and a 26-year-old man, suffered injuries. According to the police report, 'Alcohol Involvement' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' were listed as contributing factors for both drivers. The crash involved a sedan and an SUV, each traveling straight. The impact left one driver bruised and in shock, the other in pain and incoherent. The report highlights driver errors—alcohol use and ignoring traffic controls—as key causes. No pedestrians or cyclists were involved. The system allowed danger to reach the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
