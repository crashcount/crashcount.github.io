This bill aims to force change at the blueprint.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill 324 was introduced on January 1, 2025, and is in the sponsorship stage. The bill sits in the New York State Assembly, with Didi Barrett as the primary sponsor and a long list of co-sponsors, including Rebecca Seawright, Amy Paulin, and others. The bill summary reads: 'Requires the consideration of complete street design for certain transportation projects which receive federal or state funding; authorizes the department to compile and make publicly available guidance and reference material related to consideration of complete street design.' This measure would require state and federally funded transportation projects to consider designs that protect all road users, not just drivers. The bill’s broad sponsorship signals growing support for safer, more inclusive streets. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
