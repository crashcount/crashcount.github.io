In Queens CB1, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Thirteen people are dead. Twenty more are seriously injured.</strong> Over 2,700 have been hurt since 2022. Each number is a body, a family, a life split open on the asphalt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The last year alone saw <strong>three deaths and five serious injuries</strong>. The victims are not just numbers. A cyclist, a child, a man behind the wheel. Some never made it home. Some never stood a chance.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>The violence does not slow. In October, a pickup fleeing police struck and killed Amanda Servedio, a cyclist returning from a ride. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said a witness</a>. The chase ran through crowded streets. The driver did not stop. Amanda died in the road.</p><p>Her father spoke after the arrest. &ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood, and we were very upset that that&rsquo;s what actually happened,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>he told reporters</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, a 42-year-old man died at 36th Avenue and 36th Street. A 15-year-old was killed on a moped. The list grows. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> Council Member Tiffany Cabán co-sponsored the law that ended jaywalking tickets, shifting blame away from pedestrians and back to drivers (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legislation to end jaywalking tickets</a>). She also backed bills for protected bike lanes and daylighting crosswalks. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez and others supported new protected bike lanes on 31st Street, over the loud objections of some business owners (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>protected bike lanes on 31st Street</a>).</p><p>But the streets are still deadly. Promises do not stop cars. <strong>Every delay means another family waits for a knock at the door.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and enforcement that targets reckless drivers—not the people they hit.

It aims to 'establish in the city of New York a bicycle lane safety program to enforce certain restrictions on the use of bicycle lanes and/or protected bicycle lanes by means of bicycle lane photo devices.' Primary sponsor Zohran Mamdani leads a coalition of fourteen co-sponsors, including Brian Cunningham, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, and Harvey Epstein. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. If passed, it would allow automated cameras to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, a move designed to keep lanes clear for cyclists and prevent deadly crashes. Lawmakers back the measure, but the city’s vulnerable road users still face daily danger until enforcement begins.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
