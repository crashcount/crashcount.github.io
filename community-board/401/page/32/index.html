In Queens CB1, the numbers pile up. <strong>Thirteen people killed. Twenty seriously hurt. Over 2,700 injured.</strong> Each number is a name, a family, a life split open. The dead include children, cyclists, elders. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just last fall, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was struck and killed in Astoria. She was riding home from a cycling event. A pickup, fleeing police, hit her at the intersection of 37th Street and 34th Avenue. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>A father mourned. <strong>&ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood,&rdquo;</strong> he <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-no-end-in-sight>The Pattern: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not slow. In the last year alone, three more people died. <strong>Children, teens, adults—all struck down.</strong> Hundreds more were hurt. The killers are cars, SUVs, trucks, mopeds. The wounds are broken bones, crushed skulls, lives erased at the curb.</p><p>The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken. But the city does not stop the blood.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Tiffany Cabán <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop the real danger—drivers who do not yield. Cabán also co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>backed the 31st Street protected bike lane plan</a>, a proven way to save lives.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. <strong>Every day without change is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and a 20 mph speed limit.</strong> Demand that leaders act before another family gets the call. The dead do not get a second chance. The living must not wait.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Locals and officials had begged for safer streets. No bike lanes. Trucks thunder past homes. City promised action after the crash. Cyclists keep dying. The danger remains, unyielding.</p><p class=mb3>On January 6, 2023, Astoria residents and Council Member Tiffany Cabán renewed demands for safety on 24th Avenue after a cement truck killed Citi Bike rider Tamara Chuchi Kao. The street, a DOT truck route, lacks bike lanes. Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in western Queens in under three years. Former Councilmember Costa Constantinides called the area a 'serious safety risk' and urged the DOT to study improvements and reroute trucks. Cabán called the crash 'devastating' and pressed city agencies for action. DOT spokesman Vin Barone promised immediate steps at the crash site and talks on protected bike lanes. Less than 1.5 percent of streets in Council District 22 have protected bike paths. Residents say the city prioritizes highway access over safety. The city plans to add leading pedestrian intervals at the intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
