Last week, an 84-year-old driver sped through a stop sign at 19th Avenue and 42nd Street in Astoria. The car hit two men waiting for coffee. Both died. The driver died too. Witnesses said the car was &ldquo;going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people have died and over 1,000 have been injured on these streets. Six suffered injuries so severe they may never walk right again. The dead are not numbers. They are brothers, fathers, neighbors. &ldquo;He was always happy. He would make you happy. He would make happy any person in the world,&rdquo; said a victim’s brother (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-speed-and-steel>The Pattern: Speed and Steel</h3><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. In this district, SUVs and sedans alone have taken two lives and injured hundreds. Trucks and buses have killed one and hurt dozens more. Bikes and mopeds injure, but the carnage comes on four wheels. The numbers do not lie: 16 deaths, 3,014 injuries, 21 left with life-changing wounds since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leaders-words-votes-and-waiting>Leaders: Words, Votes, and Waiting</h3><p>After the latest crash, local leaders spoke. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani called for &ldquo;the acceleration of the adoption of Sammy&rsquo;s Law and has proposed a plan to limit car traffic outside our schools&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Council Member Tiffany Cabán demanded a 20 mph limit and more daylight at corners. Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes to curb repeat speeders with speed-limiting tech (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</p><p>But the street stays the same. The speed stays the same. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day the city delays a 20 mph limit, another family risks losing someone. Every day without real enforcement, the same drivers speed by. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its power to slow the streets and save lives.</p><p>Do not wait for another body on the pavement. Demand action now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The MTA pushes fare enforcement. Lawmakers and labor say focus on service, not punishment. Riders, mostly working class, depend on these buses to survive.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, highlighted on November 16, 2023, centers on bus fare evasion, free bus pilot expansion, and transit funding. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani (D-Astoria) leads the charge, arguing, "We are hitting numbers that we are not recognizing, because our focus has been on fares." The MTA claims fare compliance is vital, but Mamdani and union voices like JP Patafio of TWU Local 100 urge investment in service and affordability. The matter underscores the working-class reliance on buses and the stalled rollout of OMNY, which limits all-door boarding. The debate pits fare enforcement against calls for free or reduced fares, with advocates demanding progressive taxation to fund transit. No formal council bill or vote is attached, but the stakes for vulnerable riders are clear: service, not policing, keeps them moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
