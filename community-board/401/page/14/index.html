Council Member Tiffany Cabán and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani have called for safer streets, but the default speed limit is still too high. Each delay is another risk.

The Jeep driver was cited for driver inattention/distraction. The 24-year-old male driver of the Audi suffered a neck injury and contusion but was not ejected and remained conscious, wearing a lap belt. The Jeep driver was unlicensed, compounding the risk factors. The report highlights driver errors—distraction and unlicensed operation—as primary contributors to the collision.

The bill orders a pilot for high visibility pavement markings—at least five locations per borough. The city must target streets with high injury or fatality counts from bad driving. The matter title reads: 'establishing a high visibility pavement marking pilot program.' Council Member Yusef Salaam leads, joined by Menin, De La Rosa, Brooks-Powers, Cabán, Brannan, and Hanif. The law demands a report on results and challenges. The aim: mark danger, force drivers to see, and push the city to act where blood has already been spilled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
