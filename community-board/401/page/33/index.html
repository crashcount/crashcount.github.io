Twenty-one left with serious wounds.</strong> In just over three years, Queens CB1 has seen 5,229 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The street does not care if you are careful. It only cares if you are in the way.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>Last week, a 39-year-old moped rider died at 23rd Avenue and 37th Street. He was ejected, helmet on, dead at the scene. The crash involved an SUV. The cause: <strong>&ldquo;Traffic Control Disregarded&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

It is a system working as designed. <strong>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us,&rdquo;</strong> said Emily McKinnon after a bus crash in Queens Village (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>ABC7</a>). The bus driver did nothing wrong. The street did not care.</p><p>A 17-year-old boy died as a passenger on Astoria Boulevard. The car was speeding. The record says: &ldquo;Unsafe Speed.&rdquo; The boy is gone.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. Council Member Tiffany Cabán voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She co-sponsored bills for more protected bike lanes and to ban parking near crosswalks. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The street is faster.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and enforcement against reckless drivers—not against people on foot or bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, led by Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Robert Carroll, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum, responded to Governor Hochul’s budget proposal. The matter: 'Advocates and legislators raced up the stairs...to press their case for Gov. Hochul to do more to fill the MTA's fiscal gap.' Hochul’s plan stabilizes finances but does not boost service or halt fare hikes. Mamdani and Gounardes called for six-minute off-peak trains and new taxes on the wealthy. Gounardes said, 'We all know that we need better service and we need more service.' The proposal remains under negotiation.

Hochul also backed city control of speed limits, expanded CityTicket, and transit-oriented development. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, representing District 36, criticized Hochul for omitting a concrete plan to address the MTA’s financial crisis, warning 'fare hikes and service cuts remain possible.'

No new revenue plan. Assemblymember Mamdani sounded the alarm. Riders face fare hikes and service cuts. The city’s lifeblood hangs in the balance. Vulnerable New Yorkers wait for answers.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul delivered her State of the State address but failed to outline a plan to fill the MTA’s $600 million operating deficit. The event, covered in 'Hochul punts on new MTA revenue source amid threat of big fare hikes,' saw Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani (District 36) publicly criticize the lack of specifics, warning, 'In her silence on addressing the MTA’s operating deficit, Gov. Hochul leaves the possibility of fare hikes and service cuts on the table.' The MTA faces steep fare increases and possible service cuts if new funding is not secured. Hochul announced plans to rezone for more housing near transit to boost ridership, but offered no immediate relief. The absence of a concrete funding plan leaves vulnerable riders—those who depend on transit—at risk. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
