Twenty-one left with serious wounds.</strong> In just over three years, Queens CB1 has seen 5,229 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The street does not care if you are careful. It only cares if you are in the way.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>Last week, a 39-year-old moped rider died at 23rd Avenue and 37th Street. He was ejected, helmet on, dead at the scene. The crash involved an SUV. The cause: <strong>&ldquo;Traffic Control Disregarded&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

It is a system working as designed. <strong>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us,&rdquo;</strong> said Emily McKinnon after a bus crash in Queens Village (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>ABC7</a>). The bus driver did nothing wrong. The street did not care.</p><p>A 17-year-old boy died as a passenger on Astoria Boulevard. The car was speeding. The record says: &ldquo;Unsafe Speed.&rdquo; The boy is gone.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. Council Member Tiffany Cabán voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She co-sponsored bills for more protected bike lanes and to ban parking near crosswalks. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The street is faster.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and enforcement against reckless drivers—not against people on foot or bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident, which killed 74-year-old Be Tran at Myrtle and Seneca Avenues, triggered public outcry. Gianaris criticized the city’s process, saying, 'They have to wait until that happens to get the score high enough to realize that an intersection needs protection.' He joined activists from the Ridgewood Tenants Union and Transportation Alternatives, demanding new signals and better street design. Gianaris said he contacted the Department of Transportation a year earlier with no result. The city claims over 20 traffic control approvals in Ridgewood, but residents and advocates say it’s not enough. The call comes as pedestrian deaths and injuries continue to climb citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

StreetsPAC Executive Director Eric McClure said, 'She supports redesigning Brooklyn's bus network to simplify routes and speed commutes.' Parker did not respond to StreetsPAC's request for information and has a record of negative incidents. Mays-Williams stressed the need for dependable public transit and safer cycling. StreetsPAC also highlighted the safety records of Andrew Gounardes, Angel Vasquez, Jabori Brisport, Rajiv Gowda, Christian Amato, and Kristen Gonzalez, noting their support for speed cameras, pedestrian and bicycle safety, and transit improvements.
