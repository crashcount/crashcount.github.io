In Queens CB1, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Thirteen people are dead. Twenty more are seriously injured.</strong> Over 2,700 have been hurt since 2022. Each number is a body, a family, a life split open on the asphalt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The last year alone saw <strong>three deaths and five serious injuries</strong>. The victims are not just numbers. A cyclist, a child, a man behind the wheel. Some never made it home. Some never stood a chance.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>The violence does not slow. In October, a pickup fleeing police struck and killed Amanda Servedio, a cyclist returning from a ride. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said a witness</a>. The chase ran through crowded streets. The driver did not stop. Amanda died in the road.</p><p>Her father spoke after the arrest. &ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood, and we were very upset that that&rsquo;s what actually happened,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>he told reporters</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, a 42-year-old man died at 36th Avenue and 36th Street. A 15-year-old was killed on a moped. The list grows. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> Council Member Tiffany Cabán co-sponsored the law that ended jaywalking tickets, shifting blame away from pedestrians and back to drivers (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legislation to end jaywalking tickets</a>). She also backed bills for protected bike lanes and daylighting crosswalks. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez and others supported new protected bike lanes on 31st Street, over the loud objections of some business owners (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>protected bike lanes on 31st Street</a>).</p><p>But the streets are still deadly. Promises do not stop cars. <strong>Every delay means another family waits for a knock at the door.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and enforcement that targets reckless drivers—not the people they hit.

Black and Latino city workers now shoulder more of the cost. Lawmakers like Mamdani call it unfair. Suburban interests win. City’s vulnerable lose. Racial disparity grows.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, state lawmakers finalized a payroll tax policy as part of the MTA funding negotiations. The measure raised the payroll mobility tax only for New York City businesses with high payrolls, exempting suburban firms after pushback from their legislators. The Fiscal Policy Institute found this move shifted the tax burden onto Black and Latino workers in the city. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani condemned the policy, saying, 'this illustrates the consequences of fiscal policy that privileges the suburbs over the larger MTA region.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll was one of the few to oppose the exemption. FPI’s Emily Eisner noted, 'there will be a 25-percent decline in the share of white workers impacted by the tax, and a 36-percent increase in the share of Black workers impacted.' Governor Hochul defended the plan as necessary to save the MTA. The bill’s racial and geographic inequity remains stark.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, backed by Governor Hochul and legislative leaders, broadens enforcement to drivers blocking bus stops, truck loading zones, bike lanes, intersections, and crosswalks. Fines start at $50, escalating for repeat offenses. The MTA will increase buses with cameras from 450 to 1,000 by year's end. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and advocate Sara Lind support the move, calling it vital for bus reliability and street safety. Lind says, 'Camera-based enforcement is such a powerful tool for making our streets safer.' The budget also addresses MTA funding, but some, like Mamdani, criticize the city's increased financial burden. The bill aims to clear the way for buses and vulnerable road users, reducing dangerous blockages.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot is a key piece of the 'Fix the MTA' package. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, a main sponsor, celebrated the inclusion of free buses, stating, 'I’m excited that the vision of free buses from our Fix the MTA package has been included in this year’s budget.' The pilot aims to increase bus ridership and keep fares low, while new funding measures—like a payroll mobility tax and increased city contributions—shore up the MTA’s finances. The plan also promises more frequent subway service and avoids steep fare hikes or service cuts. The official cost of the pilot is not yet clear, but advocates and officials say it will keep the MTA stable for four years.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan is part of the 'Fix the MTA' package, originally championed by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and progressive allies. Adams said, 'I strongly support the thought of having 10 buses being free on lines in the city. I think it would make a major impact.' Mamdani called free buses 'transformative' for working-class New Yorkers. Despite this, other bus improvements lag. Adams pledged 150 miles of new bus lanes in four years, but only 11.95 miles were built last year. Some projects stalled amid political opposition. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber stressed the need for city commitment to bus lanes and warned of fare hikes and service cuts if funding gaps persist.

The proposal, championed by Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani and supported by Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, is tangled in state budget negotiations. The Assembly and Senate included the pilot in their responses to Governor Hochul’s executive budget, but the governor’s plan left it out. The pilot would select two routes per borough, one serving a low-income area and one a commercial corridor. 'I strongly support the thought of having ten buses being free. The lines in the city I think will make a major impact,' Adams said. Mamdani called free buses 'a huge win for working-class NYers.' The plan’s fate remains uncertain as Albany’s budget talks drag on. Advocates note the mayor’s slow progress on promised bus lanes, leaving riders with sluggish service even as fare relief is debated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
