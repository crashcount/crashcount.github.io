Lawmakers and advocates say this will speed up buses and protect the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>The 2023 state budget, agreed on May 1, expands the MTA's automated bus lane enforcement camera system. The bill, backed by Governor Hochul and legislative leaders, broadens enforcement to drivers blocking bus stops, truck loading zones, bike lanes, intersections, and crosswalks. Fines start at $50, escalating for repeat offenses. The MTA will increase buses with cameras from 450 to 1,000 by year's end. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and advocate Sara Lind support the move, calling it vital for bus reliability and street safety. Lind says, 'Camera-based enforcement is such a powerful tool for making our streets safer.' The budget also addresses MTA funding, but some, like Mamdani, criticize the city's increased financial burden. The bill aims to clear the way for buses and vulnerable road users, reducing dangerous blockages.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot is a key piece of the 'Fix the MTA' package. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, a main sponsor, celebrated the inclusion of free buses, stating, 'I’m excited that the vision of free buses from our Fix the MTA package has been included in this year’s budget.' The pilot aims to increase bus ridership and keep fares low, while new funding measures—like a payroll mobility tax and increased city contributions—shore up the MTA’s finances. The plan also promises more frequent subway service and avoids steep fare hikes or service cuts. The official cost of the pilot is not yet clear, but advocates and officials say it will keep the MTA stable for four years.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 19, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams endorsed a pilot to make two bus routes free in each borough, totaling ten free buses. The plan is part of the 'Fix the MTA' package, originally championed by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and progressive allies. Adams said, 'I strongly support the thought of having 10 buses being free on lines in the city. I think it would make a major impact.' Mamdani called free buses 'transformative' for working-class New Yorkers. Despite this, other bus improvements lag. Adams pledged 150 miles of new bus lanes in four years, but only 11.95 miles were built last year. Some projects stalled amid political opposition. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber stressed the need for city commitment to bus lanes and warned of fare hikes and service cuts if funding gaps persist. No formal safety analysis was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, championed by Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani and supported by Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, is tangled in state budget negotiations. The Assembly and Senate included the pilot in their responses to Governor Hochul’s executive budget, but the governor’s plan left it out. The pilot would select two routes per borough, one serving a low-income area and one a commercial corridor. 'I strongly support the thought of having ten buses being free. The lines in the city I think will make a major impact,' Adams said. Mamdani called free buses 'a huge win for working-class NYers.' The plan’s fate remains uncertain as Albany’s budget talks drag on. Advocates note the mayor’s slow progress on promised bus lanes, leaving riders with sluggish service even as fare relief is debated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
