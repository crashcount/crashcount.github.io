The fight for safer, fairer transit rolls on.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, discussed on February 25, 2022, centers on the push for free bus service in New York City. The matter, titled 'Is It Time For Free Buses In New York City?', highlights calls from TWU Local 100 Vice-President JP Patafio and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas to end fare enforcement and make buses free. Patafio said, 'They should look at making local bus service free. As we saw during the pandemic, it's an essential public service.' González-Rojas argued that free buses sped up service and helped riders during the pandemic. She is working on proposals to boost MTA funding and pilot free lines. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber pushed back, citing a $2B-plus deficit and stressing the need for faster, more reliable buses. Advocates and officials agree: bus improvements and fare-free service are not mutually exclusive.
