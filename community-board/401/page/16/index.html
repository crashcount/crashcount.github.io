The policy reversal, covered by Gothamist, sparked outrage among transit advocates and progressives.

Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani condemned the move as 'political malpractice.' Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, District 23, was mentioned in coverage but did not take a direct action.

The bill orders the Department of Transportation, with Health and Mental Hygiene, to run a pilot project testing cool pavement—materials that lower street temperatures—across at least four neighborhoods facing heat and disadvantage. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law in relation to requiring the department of transportation to conduct a pilot project on the use of cool pavement.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by 29 co-sponsors. The bill requires DOT to report findings to the Mayor and Council.

They say MTA left Queens behind. Riders in transit deserts face long, costly trips. Lawmakers call the exclusion unacceptable. They want fair service before new fees begin.</p><p class=mb3>On May 16, 2024, ten Queens lawmakers, including Julia Salazar (District 18), urged the MTA to expand express bus service to Queens before the $15 Manhattan congestion toll starts. The group wrote to MTA chairman Janno Lieber, stating, "Express buses play a vital role in Queens’ public transit network and only stand to become even more pivotal in the near and distant future." They criticized the MTA for boosting express bus service in Brooklyn and Staten Island but not Queens, calling the exclusion "unacceptable." The lawmakers stressed that many southeast and northeast Queens residents lack subway access and rely on express buses to reach Midtown. They argued the 10 percent LIRR discount is no substitute for robust bus service. Salazar and her colleagues support congestion pricing but insist its success depends on expanded, equitable transit for all vulnerable riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
