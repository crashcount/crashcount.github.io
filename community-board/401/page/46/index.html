Last week, an 84-year-old driver sped through a stop sign at 19th Avenue and 42nd Street in Astoria. The car hit two men waiting for coffee. Both died. The driver died too. Witnesses said the car was &ldquo;going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people have died and over 1,000 have been injured on these streets. Six suffered injuries so severe they may never walk right again. The dead are not numbers. They are brothers, fathers, neighbors. &ldquo;He was always happy. He would make you happy. He would make happy any person in the world,&rdquo; said a victim’s brother (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-speed-and-steel>The Pattern: Speed and Steel</h3><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. In this district, SUVs and sedans alone have taken two lives and injured hundreds. Trucks and buses have killed one and hurt dozens more. Bikes and mopeds injure, but the carnage comes on four wheels. The numbers do not lie: 16 deaths, 3,014 injuries, 21 left with life-changing wounds since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leaders-words-votes-and-waiting>Leaders: Words, Votes, and Waiting</h3><p>After the latest crash, local leaders spoke. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani called for &ldquo;the acceleration of the adoption of Sammy&rsquo;s Law and has proposed a plan to limit car traffic outside our schools&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Council Member Tiffany Cabán demanded a 20 mph limit and more daylight at corners. Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes to curb repeat speeders with speed-limiting tech (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</p><p>But the street stays the same. The speed stays the same. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day the city delays a 20 mph limit, another family risks losing someone. Every day without real enforcement, the same drivers speed by. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its power to slow the streets and save lives.</p><p>Do not wait for another body on the pavement. Demand action now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warned that cuts or fare hikes would devastate working- and middle-class New Yorkers.

The fight moves to City Planning.</p><p class=mb3>On November 7, 2022, Queens Community Board 2 passed a resolution rejecting a rezoning application for a Lincoln SUV dealership on Northern Boulevard, Woodside. The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The clock runs out.</p><p class=mb3>On November 1, 2022, Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas joined advocates in Jackson Heights to demand faster bus lane construction under the New York City Streets Plan. The plan, launched to comply with a 2019 law, mandates 150 miles of protected bus lanes by 2026—20 miles in 2022 alone. With two months left, only 5.4 miles were finished. González-Rojas declared, 'We demand to get our 20 miles of bus lanes.' The rally took place on Northern Boulevard, a corridor scarred by pedestrian deaths, including 9-year-old Giovanni Ampuero. His father spoke out: 'If you don’t improve the street, people are going to still get killed.' The Department of Transportation claims progress and a $900 million investment, but the pace lags. The city’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as deadly streets remain unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
