The driver, Stanley Manel, was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Gonzalez, representing District 59, called for the state to pass stricter traffic laws targeting drivers with multiple school zone speed camera violations, noting Manel's history of speeding. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher joined Gonzalez, highlighting the lack of traffic calming on Nassau Avenue, where Aber was killed. Gallagher stated, 'Nothing to slow traffic on Nassau: no signal, stop sign, even a painted crosswalk.' The officials urged immediate installation of pedestrian safety measures and renewed calls for policy changes to protect vulnerable road users.

Restler and colleagues highlighted the intersection's dangers and the driver's history—35 tickets since 2019, including 26 speed camera violations. They urged support for bills requiring speed control devices for repeat offenders and for Sammy’s Law, which would let NYC set its own speed limits.

The collision involved two Station Wagons/SUVs and one sedan. The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor. One SUV was 'Starting in Traffic' while the other was 'Stopped in Traffic,' and the sedan was 'Going Straight Ahead.' The point of impact was the left front bumper of the sedan and one SUV, and the right front bumper of the other SUV. A 32-year-old male driver, an occupant in one of the vehicles, suffered injuries to his elbow and lower arm but was not ejected and remained conscious. The report does not list any contributing factors related to the victim's behavior. This crash underscores the dangers posed by driver errors, specifically failure to yield, in multi-vehicle collisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

They unveiled a $90-million plan to boost bus service. Adams faces accusations of incompetence and ignoring the law. Bus speeds drop. Riders wait. The mayor stalls. Streets stay dangerous for those outside cars.</p><p class=mb3>On February 9, 2024, at a legislative press conference, State Sen. Mike Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani announced a $90-million proposal to expand bus service and the MTA's free bus pilot. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, became a public reckoning for Mayor Adams's transportation record. The matter: 'a proposal in Albany to increase bus service before congestion pricing begins.' Mamdani accused Adams of 'incompetence' and violating the Streets Master Plan law, which requires 30 miles of new bus lanes each year. Reporters pressed for answers on mayoral compliance. MTA CEO Janno Lieber praised Adams's past promises but noted the lack of progress. The mayor's spokesperson defended the administration, but data shows bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the lack of bus lanes leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic danger and slow, unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, introduced February 8, 2024, mandates that only commercial vehicles may park in these zones between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. The matter title states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the creation of curbside overnight truck parking sections in Industrial Business Zones.' Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), Nantasha M. Williams, Lincoln Restler, Farah N. Louis, Kevin C. Riley, and others back the measure.
