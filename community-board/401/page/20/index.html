Four seriously hurt.</strong> In the past year alone, Queens CB1 has seen 803 crashes, 458 injuries, and two lives ended on its streets. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement, families left with empty chairs. A 17-year-old passenger, dead in a tangle of sedans on Astoria Boulevard. A 15-year-old moped rider, crushed by a bus on 43rd Street. A cyclist, a pedestrian, a child—none spared by the machinery of the street.</p><h2 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h2><p>After the bus jumped the curb in Flushing, <strong>Jacqueline Cox said,</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus.&rdquo;</a> Eight people hurt. A pole down. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb,&rdquo; but video showed he had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. <strong>&ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said Samantha Hart</a>. The crash could have killed more. It was luck, not policy, that spared them.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-missed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Missed</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> State Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. It <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>passed committee in June</a>. But the carnage continues. Council Member Tiffany Cabán and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani have <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/04/beach-reading-zohran-mamdanis-answers-to-streetsblogs-mayoral-candidate-survey>called for safer streets</a>, but the pace is slow. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst keep driving. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so citywide. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made upstream. Residents must demand more. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The meeting followed a deadly year: a 75-year-old man killed by an e-bike, two injured in a dirt bike crash. Residents described near-misses and constant danger on the 34th Avenue open street. The matter, titled 'On Jackson Heights’ open street, NYC’s ‘moped crisis’ is in full throttle,' drew city officials, including DOT and Mayor Adams, who backed enforcement and moped registration. Krishnan slammed DOT’s reliance on signage, pushing instead for a dedicated micromobility lane. Delivery worker advocates opposed criminalization, demanding labor protections and safe infrastructure. Despite new signs and vehicle seizures, mopeds still speed through.

At a 'Moped Crisis' town hall, Krishnan called the area a 'moped highway' and said, 'The biggest problem that we have is poor design by the DOT.' He demanded a redesign that separates speeding vehicles from people and creates safe corridors for mopeds away from recreational spaces. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas echoed the call for engineering solutions, stating, 'We must design the roads to ensure that mopeds are not getting on [Paseo Park], and are not driving recklessly.' DOT staff highlighted enforcement efforts, but Krishnan and others insisted that design, not enforcement, must come first.

The Legislature rejected Hochul’s push for a payroll tax hike, then considered a vague $1 billion IOU for the MTA, with no funding source. Gianaris told reporters the proposal would simply promise a billion dollars for the next year’s budget, but offered no details. The bill has not been introduced or assigned to committee. Betsy Plum of the Riders Alliance warned, 'The proposal on the table will not fix the subway. A billion dollar IOU is not nearly enough money nor is it nearly secure enough to build trust and rebuild our critical infrastructure.' With no new revenue, the MTA’s ability to fund repairs and upgrades remains in doubt. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders—face continued danger as safe, reliable alternatives to driving are left unfunded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'
