She never makes it. On October 22, 2024, Amanda Servedio, 36, was struck and killed at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. The driver was fleeing police, running red lights, speeding through bike lanes. &ldquo;The defendant allegedly led police on a 10-minute chase through the crowded streets,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/staten-island-man-charged-with-murder-in-hit-and-run-crash-with-queens-cyclist>said Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz</a>. Amanda was thrown from her bike into a parked car. She died at Elmhurst Hospital. Her ride ended in blood and silence.</p><p>In the last twelve months, Queens CB1 saw <strong>2 deaths and 786 injuries</strong> from crashes. Five people suffered serious, life-changing wounds. The numbers do not slow. They do not care how old you are. Children, teens, adults, the old—all are at risk. In the same period, a 17-year-old died as a passenger in a sedan. A 15-year-old moped rider was killed by a bus. The street does not forgive.</p><h2 id=local-leaders-words-votes-and-the-waiting>Local Leaders: Words, Votes, and the Waiting</h2><p>The council member, <a href=/council-district/22/>Tiffany Cabán</a>, has backed bills to daylight intersections, speed up protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking. She voted yes to erase penalties for crossing mid-block, shifting blame away from pedestrians. The new law requires the city to educate all road users about these rights. &ldquo;By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable,&rdquo; <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>reads the council record</a>.</p><p>Senator <a href=/senate-district/59/>Kristen Gonzalez</a> and Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/36/>Zohran Mamdani</a> have supported protected bike lanes and slow zones. They signed on to plans for a protected bike lane under the 31st Street tracks. &ldquo;It would protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>they wrote</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow.

Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and enforcement that targets reckless drivers—not people on foot or bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Restler and colleagues highlighted the intersection's dangers and the driver's history—35 tickets since 2019, including 26 speed camera violations. They urged support for bills requiring speed control devices for repeat offenders and for Sammy’s Law, which would let NYC set its own speed limits.

Mike Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani announced a $90-million proposal to expand bus service and the MTA's free bus pilot. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, became a public reckoning for Mayor Adams's transportation record. The matter: 'a proposal in Albany to increase bus service before congestion pricing begins.' Mamdani accused Adams of 'incompetence' and violating the Streets Master Plan law, which requires 30 miles of new bus lanes each year. Reporters pressed for answers on mayoral compliance. MTA CEO Janno Lieber praised Adams's past promises but noted the lack of progress. The mayor's spokesperson defended the administration, but data shows bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the lack of bus lanes leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic danger and slow, unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bicyclist was ejected from his bike and sustained injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot, resulting in minor bleeding and shock. The report identifies the contributing factors as driver inattention and failure to yield right-of-way. The sedan's right front quarter panel and the bike's left front quarter panel were the points of impact. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle southwestbound. No safety equipment was noted on the bicyclist, but the police report does not list this as a contributing factor. The crash highlights critical driver errors leading to serious injury of a vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Words do not move buses.</p><p class=mb3>On February 6, 2024, Mayor Eric Adams declared his administration had done an 'amazing job' building bus lanes in New York City. In reality, Adams missed legal targets: only 12.9 miles built in 2022 out of 20 required, and 13.3 miles in 2023 out of 30. Bus speeds dropped from 7.7 mph in January 2022 to 7.4 mph in December 2023. Adams claimed his approach was 'revolutionary' for prioritizing community input. Critics, including Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, countered that Adams canceled or stalled key projects like Fordham Road, despite strong community support. Mamdani said, 'he's made 1.4 million daily bus riders take the slowest buses in the country.' The mayor’s promises remain unmet. Bus riders and pedestrians still wait for safer, faster streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The numbers tell another story. Promised miles not built. Bus speeds drop. Riders stranded. Assembly Member Mamdani calls out broken promises. The city stalls. Streets stay dangerous for those outside cars.</p><p class=mb3>On February 6, 2024, Mayor Adams declared his administration had done an 'amazing job' building bus lanes. The facts cut through the claim. In 2022, only 12.9 miles of bus lanes were built out of a required 20. In 2023, just 13.3 miles out of a required 30. The Department of Transportation missed legal targets both years. The matter, as reported, states: 'Mayor Adams claimed... his administration has done an "amazing job" building bus lanes... despite missing legally required targets.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, representing District 36, slammed the mayor for scrapping key projects and failing bus riders. Mamdani said, '49 percent of bus riders are dissatisfied with wait times... instead he's made 1.4 million daily bus riders take the slowest buses in the country.' Riders Alliance joined the criticism, demanding a real plan for the 130 miles of overdue bus lanes. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed, with no clear agenda for safer, faster streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
