Each body is a life changed or ended.</p><p>A 17-year-old died in the front seat of a sedan on Astoria Boulevard.

Council Member Tiffany Cabán and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani have called for safer streets, but the default speed limit is still too high. Each delay is another risk.

The article, titled 'The 34th Street busway is the latest casualty of the mayor's lack of a spine on transportation issues,' highlights how Mayor Adams ignored broad support and bowed to a vocal few. Meyer supports the busway and criticizes the mayor’s retreat. No council bill number or committee is tied to this action. The delay blocks safer, more equitable streets.
