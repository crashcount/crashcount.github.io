The article, titled 'The 34th Street busway is the latest casualty of the mayor's lack of a spine on transportation issues,' highlights how Mayor Adams ignored broad support and bowed to a vocal few. Meyer supports the busway and criticizes the mayor’s retreat. No council bill number or committee is tied to this action. The delay blocks safer, more equitable streets.

There is no formal bill number or committee, but the focus is his push for 'fast and free buses,' fare freezes, and bus lane enforcement. Mamdani led efforts in Albany for a fare-free bus pilot and more frequent service. Sen. Mike Gianaris credits Mamdani for getting free buses done. Safety analysts note: 'Policies promoting fast and free buses encourage mode shift from private vehicles to public transit, reducing traffic volumes and improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists through lower exposure to motor vehicle risk.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Senator Michael Gianaris backed the pilot, calling the cost manageable. Experts warn of service tradeoffs. The safety analyst notes: increased ridership signals a shift from cars, boosting safety for pedestrians and cyclists through safety in numbers and less vehicle traffic.
