The project, which was supposed to upgrade a painted lane to a parking-protected lane, has been pushed to at least next spring. Ossé wrote to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, calling the delay 'unacceptable' and demanding a firm installation date. He stated, 'The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.' Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, echoed his frustration, citing record cyclist deaths and urgent need for safety. The DOT has not responded to requests for comment.

Session ended, bill filed.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0792-2023, filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, urges Albany to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B. The bill would require scramble crosswalks at school entrances during arrival and dismissal. The matter, introduced September 28, 2023, was sponsored by Council Members Hanif (primary), Brooks-Powers, Restler, and Riley. The resolution states: 'establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' The council highlights a surge in crashes near schools and the loss of 486 NYPD crossing guards. The bill aims to cut deadly conflict between cars and children. The session ended with the bill filed, not enacted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
