The city pays for silence.</p><p class=mb3>On April 7, 2022, an NYPD officer fatally struck Ronald Smith, 53, on Eastern Parkway. The officer, accused of speeding and running a red light, was placed on modified duty. The Internal Affairs Bureau and the state Attorney General opened investigations. The NYPD refused to release crash details or the officer's name. Council Member Crystal Hudson issued a blistering statement demanding the officer's termination, not desk duty. The matter summary states, 'The police officer who was driving the NYPD vehicle that fatally struck a man...has been placed on modified duty.' The NYPD's lack of transparency is routine. Truths surface only after lawsuits. In 2020, vehicle crashes cost the city $142 million. Police settlements are a heavy burden. The system shields its own, leaving families to seek answers in court.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
