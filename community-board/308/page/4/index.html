A black Honda Pilot hit him. Neighbors saw the boy dragged from under the SUV. &ldquo;I just saw a lot of blood gushing out of his ears, his mouth,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>a witness said</a>. The driver stayed. No arrest. The street was cleaned. The boy did not go home.</p><p>In the past twelve months, <strong>one person died and five suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>387 people were hurt</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers. The numbers do not stop. Since 2022, ten have died, including a child. More than 1,600 have been injured. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty beds, families left with silence.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the harm.</strong> SUVs and sedans alone caused over 250 pedestrian injuries and one death. Trucks and buses killed another. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left more people hurt. The street is a gauntlet. The risk is not shared. The strong survive. The vulnerable bleed.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have spoken.</strong> Council Members <a href=/council-district/36/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/36/>Chi Ossé</a> have co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and push for citywide safety upgrades. But the bills sit in committee. The danger waits for no one.</p><p>State Senator <a href=/senate-district/20/>Zellnor Myrie</a> rode a bike through Brooklyn. He said, &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>he told Streetsblog</a>. The streets did not change.</p><h3 id=the-street-remembers>The Street Remembers</h3><p>A teacher said of the boy, &ldquo;I loved that boy. He was a great kid&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>the New York Post reported</a>. The city moved on. The blood on the street dried. The risk remains.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These deaths are not the weather. Demand more. Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them to pass the bills, build the lanes, clear the corners, and slow the cars. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Voters want action.</p><p class=mb3>On April 15, 2025, a Siena College poll revealed that 77% of New York City voters rank pedestrian safety as a top concern. The poll, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found deep worry among women, seniors, and Bronx residents. The matter summary reads: '77% of NYC voters consider pedestrian safety a serious issue.' Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death. The poll signals a mandate: fix the streets, protect the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to build new medians between bike lanes and car lanes that can support trees and other vegetation, subject to feasibility.

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year.

The city stalls.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-03-31) reports a deadly crash on Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn. Miriam Yarimi, driving on a suspended license, ran a red light, made an illegal turn, and struck the Saada family in a crosswalk. Natasha Saada and her daughters, ages 8 and 5, were killed; her son remains critical. Five others were injured. The article notes, 'They happen so frequently that it's not shocking anymore.' Ocean Parkway is notorious for reckless driving and has seen 15 deaths since 2017. Locals and advocates highlight confusing signals, poor bike lane upkeep, and repeated calls for redesign. The crash vehicle had 21 speed tickets since 2023. The city DOT cites jurisdictional limits, as Ocean Parkway is a state road, complicating safety upgrades.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
