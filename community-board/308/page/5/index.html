A black Honda Pilot hit him. Neighbors saw the boy dragged from under the SUV. &ldquo;I just saw a lot of blood gushing out of his ears, his mouth,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>a witness said</a>. The driver stayed. No arrest. The street was cleaned. The boy did not go home.</p><p>In the past twelve months, <strong>one person died and five suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>387 people were hurt</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers. The numbers do not stop. Since 2022, ten have died, including a child. More than 1,600 have been injured. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty beds, families left with silence.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the harm.</strong> SUVs and sedans alone caused over 250 pedestrian injuries and one death. Trucks and buses killed another. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left more people hurt. The street is a gauntlet. The risk is not shared. The strong survive. The vulnerable bleed.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have spoken.</strong> Council Members <a href=/council-district/36/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/36/>Chi Ossé</a> have co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and push for citywide safety upgrades. But the bills sit in committee. The danger waits for no one.</p><p>State Senator <a href=/senate-district/20/>Zellnor Myrie</a> rode a bike through Brooklyn. He said, &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>he told Streetsblog</a>. The streets did not change.</p><h3 id=the-street-remembers>The Street Remembers</h3><p>A teacher said of the boy, &ldquo;I loved that boy. He was a great kid&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>the New York Post reported</a>. The city moved on. The blood on the street dried. The risk remains.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These deaths are not the weather. Demand more. Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them to pass the bills, build the lanes, clear the corners, and slow the cars. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Steel and stone replace painted lines.</p><p class=mb3>The Brooklyn Paper reported on June 11, 2025, that NYC DOT will redesign intersections to protect cyclists and pedestrians. The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. The move highlights the city's shift from painted lines to physical infrastructure, aiming to reduce systemic risk for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This comes as Tisch’s department intensifies enforcement against cyclists. Streetsblog NYC reported, 'Both Brad Lander and Zellnor Myrie, mayoral candidates, have reiterated their pledge to retain NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch if elected, despite concerns over her crackdown on cyclists.' Lander’s spokesperson, Kat Capossela, said Lander trusts Tisch to implement his policies, including cracking down on reckless drivers, even as Tisch currently targets cyclists. Myrie’s campaign promised to keep streets safe without unnecessary enforcement. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and former Comptroller Scott Stringer also weighed in, but stopped short of firm commitments. A safety analyst notes: Retaining a commissioner known for crackdowns on cyclists likely perpetuates enforcement-focused approaches that burden vulnerable road users, discouraging cycling and undermining mode shift and street equity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, announced by MTA Construction & Development president Jamie Torres-Springer and supported by State Sen. Zellnor Myrie, promises to 'finally unclog a notoriously slow-rolling segment of the subway.' The project will keep express and local trains on their tracks, cut delays, and boost throughput from 44 to 60 trains per hour. Myrie said, 'I'm proud the MTA Capital Plan includes funding to finally un-cluster Crown Heights so more New Yorkers can get to work and school on time.' According to safety analysts, improving subway service can shift trips from cars to transit, reducing car traffic and risks for pedestrians and cyclists. The work is overdue.

The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lafleur was in the crosswalk, with the signal to walk. A witness said, "The lady spin around and sped through." The driver, a 64-year-old woman, has not been charged. The vehicle had one prior violation for blocking a bus lane. The article highlights the lack of immediate accountability and calls for stronger pedestrian protections: "The government should do something, like when people are walking, no cars should be moving."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
