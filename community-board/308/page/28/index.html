Police said the 41-year-old woman driving the black 2014 Mercedes GL 550 'came into contact' with the pedestrian. He suffered severe head trauma and died at Kings County Hospital. The driver remained at the scene and was not charged. The NYPD released little information, citing the Department of Transportation’s oversight of the Collision Investigation Squad. This fatality comes weeks after another deadly crash nearby involving a police officer. Attorney General Letitia James has opened a review of that earlier case. Smith’s sister criticized the NYPD for withholding information. The city’s streets remain dangerous for those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The officer, accused of speeding and running a red light, was placed on modified duty. The Internal Affairs Bureau and the state Attorney General opened investigations. The NYPD refused to release crash details or the officer's name. Council Member Crystal Hudson issued a blistering statement demanding the officer's termination, not desk duty. The matter summary states, 'The police officer who was driving the NYPD vehicle that fatally struck a man...has been placed on modified duty.' The NYPD's lack of transparency is routine. Truths surface only after lawsuits. In 2020, vehicle crashes cost the city $142 million. Police settlements are a heavy burden. The system shields its own, leaving families to seek answers in court.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
