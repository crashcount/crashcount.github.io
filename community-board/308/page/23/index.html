A black Honda Pilot hit him.

Children, elders, cyclists, walkers. The numbers do not stop. Since 2022, ten have died, including a child. More than 1,600 have been injured. The wounds are not just numbers.

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure highlights research showing subway air holds two to seven times more hazardous particles than city streets. These pollutants, from grinding wheels and diesel soot, threaten riders and workers—especially lower-income, Black, Hispanic, and immigrant New Yorkers.

The case, reviewed internally by Assistant Trial Commissioner Josh Kleiman, ended with Kovalik cleared of wrongdoing. The Civilian Complaint Review Board had found Kovalik abused his authority, but Kleiman ruled, 'The evidence fails to support either of the specifications with which Respondent is charged.' NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell signed off on the decision. Senator Myrie, who testified about being shoved and threatened, condemned the ruling: 'This ruling is EXACTLY why New Yorkers have zero faith in the system.' Myrie and then-Assembly Member Diana Richardson, both detained at the protest, have filed a federal lawsuit.
