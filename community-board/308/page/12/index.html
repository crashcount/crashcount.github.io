The collision occurred at 15:47 in Brooklyn. The pedestrian sustained a back contusion and was conscious at the scene. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor to the crash. The vehicle's point of impact was the center front end, and despite the collision, the sedan showed no damage. The driver, a licensed female from New York, was operating the vehicle with three occupants inside. The pedestrian’s crossing with the signal was noted but not cited as a contributing factor.

This marks the lowest bus lane mileage since 2018. The matter, titled 'Adams Has Proposed Just 7 Miles of Bus Lanes This Year — Less Than 1/4 of Requirement,' has drawn sharp criticism. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie called it 'unacceptable that Mayor Adams has not prioritized improving bus speeds, service, and reliability.' Scott Stringer accused the administration of using 'community engagement as an excuse to not get things done.' Brad Lander pledged to push for more dedicated bus lanes. Riders like Alex Gean described daily gridlock. The DOT claims more lanes are coming, but offers no details. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain at risk as the city fails to meet its own safety and mobility targets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
