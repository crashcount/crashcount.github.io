A black Honda Pilot hit him.

Children, elders, cyclists, walkers. The numbers do not stop. Since 2022, ten have died, including a child. More than 1,600 have been injured. The wounds are not just numbers.

Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began.

The call: fund safety now.</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2022, more than a dozen City Council members and advocates gathered at City Hall to demand full funding for the Streets Master Plan. The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began. The mayor’s proposed $98.5-billion budget did not allocate significant funds for the plan. Advocates say the city must act now to stem the bloodshed on its streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a 'police-involved traffic fatality and official response,' has drawn sharp criticism. Julie Floyd, Smith’s sister, demands the officers be fired, stating, 'If one of us runs a red light... there's a risk of us getting shot.' Council Member Crystal Hudson echoed the call for termination. The NYPD has not commented, only placing the driver on modified duty. The state Attorney General’s office is also investigating, as required in police-involved deaths. Vehicle crashes, especially those involving NYPD, drive up city settlement costs.

The incident, classified as an official statement on NYPD-involved traffic fatality and street safety policy, drew sharp criticism from Council Member Crystal Hudson, who called out the NYPD’s 'complete disregard for human life' and demanded the release of the driver’s name and termination of involved officers. The matter summary states: 'Police have offered no new details about the fatal crash caused by the driver of an NYPD van.' Transportation Alternatives’ Danny Harris highlighted the city’s failure to redesign this Vision Zero priority corridor, noting that 'paint is not protection.' The group cited five deaths and hundreds of injuries on this stretch in five years. Advocates and council members call for full funding and real street safety improvements, not empty gestures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The process lets residents as young as 11 vote on capital and expense projects. The official matter title: 'Voting for Participatory Budgeting is open in five Brooklyn districts until April 10.' Joseph, along with councilmembers Jennifer Gutiérrez (34), Chi Ossé (36), Alexa Avilés (38), and Shahana Hanif (39), offers in-person and online voting. Projects range from park upgrades to school improvements. Final results will be announced the week of April 17. Participatory Budgeting shapes how public money is spent, but the safety impact for vulnerable road users depends on which projects win.
