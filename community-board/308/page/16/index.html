The incident came days after Governor Hochul’s National Guard deployment in the transit system. Simon stated, 'The Governor's recent deployment of the National Guard was unwarranted and caused fear rather than a sense of safety.' Other officials, including Brian Cunningham and Lester Chang, debated the effectiveness of increased policing and called for more investment in mental health and gun safety. The matter, titled 'NYC subway shooting a ‘wake up call’,' underscores deep divides on how to protect riders.

The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure passed it on October 26, 2024. The bill states: 'crossing against a traffic signal or outside a crosswalk will not be a violation.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led, joined by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, Restler, Mealy, Louis, and Bottcher. The law bans summonses for jaywalking and orders the Department of Transportation to educate the public on new rights and responsibilities. The mayor returned it unsigned.
