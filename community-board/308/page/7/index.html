The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws. Some opposition remains, but supporters say the measure is urgent and practical.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street filled with grief and broken glass.</p><p class=mb3>According to the NY Daily News (published March 29, 2025), a blue Audi A3 driven by Miriam Yarimi, whose license was suspended, crashed into a TLC Toyota Camry on Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn. The impact pushed the Camry aside and sent the Audi into four pedestrians—a mother and her three young children—crossing in the crosswalk. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, "This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road." The mother and two daughters died; a four-year-old boy remains in critical condition. The Audi overturned. Speed cameras are present at the intersection, but the investigation continues. No criminal charges have been filed. The crash highlights the lethal risk posed by unlicensed drivers and the vulnerability of people on foot, even in marked crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.
