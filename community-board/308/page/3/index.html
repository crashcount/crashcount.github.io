A black Honda Pilot hit him. Neighbors saw the boy dragged from under the SUV. &ldquo;I just saw a lot of blood gushing out of his ears, his mouth,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>a witness said</a>. The driver stayed. No arrest. The street was cleaned. The boy did not go home.</p><p>In the past twelve months, <strong>one person died and five suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>387 people were hurt</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers. The numbers do not stop. Since 2022, ten have died, including a child. More than 1,600 have been injured. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty beds, families left with silence.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the harm.</strong> SUVs and sedans alone caused over 250 pedestrian injuries and one death. Trucks and buses killed another. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left more people hurt. The street is a gauntlet. The risk is not shared. The strong survive. The vulnerable bleed.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have spoken.</strong> Council Members <a href=/council-district/36/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/36/>Chi Ossé</a> have co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and push for citywide safety upgrades. But the bills sit in committee. The danger waits for no one.</p><p>State Senator <a href=/senate-district/20/>Zellnor Myrie</a> rode a bike through Brooklyn. He said, &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>he told Streetsblog</a>. The streets did not change.</p><h3 id=the-street-remembers>The Street Remembers</h3><p>A teacher said of the boy, &ldquo;I loved that boy. He was a great kid&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>the New York Post reported</a>. The city moved on. The blood on the street dried. The risk remains.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These deaths are not the weather. Demand more. Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them to pass the bills, build the lanes, clear the corners, and slow the cars. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes.

The event, titled 'Decision 2025: Mayoral Question 2 Seeks Answers on Slow Buses,' asked candidates how they would fix New York’s slowest-in-the-nation bus system. Brad Lander, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, Whitney Tilson, Zellnor Myrie, and Zohran Mamdani answered. They called for more bus lanes, stronger enforcement, and faster service. No council bill was introduced; this was a public policy test, not legislation. According to the safety analyst, the event discussed bus speeds but did not specify any policy action affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so no direct safety impact can be assessed. The debate showed urgency but left vulnerable road users waiting for real change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The question was sharp. Congestion pricing cuts traffic. What comes after? Candidates must answer. Streets stay deadly. Pedestrians and cyclists wait for action. The city’s future hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2025, Streetsblog NYC launched a mayoral policy debate, pressing candidates on congestion pricing. The event was not a council bill, but a public challenge. Streetsblog asked: 'Now that congestion pricing is operating in New York City, what should the city government do to build on its success in reducing Manhattan traffic?' Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Whitney Tilson responded, each supporting congestion pricing and further transit investment. Streetsblog’s demand was clear—protect vulnerable road users. The safety analyst notes that congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and opens the door for street redesigns that put vulnerable users first. The debate underscores urgency: congestion pricing helps, but more must be done to make streets safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue.
