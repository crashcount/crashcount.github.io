A black Honda Pilot hit him. Neighbors saw the boy dragged from under the SUV. &ldquo;I just saw a lot of blood gushing out of his ears, his mouth,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>a witness said</a>. The driver stayed. No arrest. The street was cleaned. The boy did not go home.</p><p>In the past twelve months, <strong>one person died and five suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>387 people were hurt</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers. The numbers do not stop. Since 2022, ten have died, including a child. More than 1,600 have been injured. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty beds, families left with silence.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the harm.</strong> SUVs and sedans alone caused over 250 pedestrian injuries and one death. Trucks and buses killed another. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left more people hurt. The street is a gauntlet. The risk is not shared. The strong survive. The vulnerable bleed.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have spoken.</strong> Council Members <a href=/council-district/36/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/36/>Chi Ossé</a> have co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and push for citywide safety upgrades. But the bills sit in committee. The danger waits for no one.</p><p>State Senator <a href=/senate-district/20/>Zellnor Myrie</a> rode a bike through Brooklyn. He said, &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>he told Streetsblog</a>. The streets did not change.</p><h3 id=the-street-remembers>The Street Remembers</h3><p>A teacher said of the boy, &ldquo;I loved that boy. He was a great kid&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>the New York Post reported</a>. The city moved on. The blood on the street dried. The risk remains.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These deaths are not the weather. Demand more. Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them to pass the bills, build the lanes, clear the corners, and slow the cars. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

This marks the lowest bus lane mileage since 2018. The matter, titled 'Adams Has Proposed Just 7 Miles of Bus Lanes This Year — Less Than 1/4 of Requirement,' has drawn sharp criticism. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie called it 'unacceptable that Mayor Adams has not prioritized improving bus speeds, service, and reliability.' Scott Stringer accused the administration of using 'community engagement as an excuse to not get things done.' Brad Lander pledged to push for more dedicated bus lanes. Riders like Alex Gean described daily gridlock. The DOT claims more lanes are coming, but offers no details.

The report states the motorcyclist was helmeted but unlicensed. The van was stationary and unoccupied at the time of the crash. The narrative describes the motorcycle crumpling on impact and the rider dying at the scene from head injuries. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. No actions by the van or its driver contributed to the incident, as the vehicle was parked. The report notes the rider's helmet use and unlicensed status, but cites driver inattention as the primary factor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
