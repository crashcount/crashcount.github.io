It leaves a trail. Since 2022, it’s the top killer here, with <strong>four deaths and 244 injuries</strong> on that corridor alone, per city crash data. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=atlantic-at-kingston-dead-on-arrival>Atlantic at Kingston: dead on arrival</h3><ul><li>March 16, 2024, just after midnight. A moped rider was killed at Atlantic and Kingston. The record lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4710249</a>.</li><li>Nov. 22, 2023, late morning.

A 39‑year‑old man walking outside a crosswalk zone on Atlantic was struck and killed in a crash involving an SUV and a box truck. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4727579</a>.</li></ul><p>Heavy vehicles show up in the worst files: a tractor truck, a box truck, a refrigerated van. Across CB8’s pedestrian injuries, trucks and buses are tied to deaths this period, with <strong>one pedestrian killed</strong> and serious harm in others. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC crash rollup</a>.</p><h3 id=the-clock-doesnt-care>The clock doesn’t care</h3><p>In this board area, pain spreads across the day. Injuries spike at the commute and dinner hours. The 5 p.m. hour is the worst: <strong>144 injuries</strong>. At 6 p.m., <strong>138 injuries</strong>. Deaths hit at many hours: 8 a.m., late morning, noon, 2 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p.m., 10 p.m., 11 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m. The danger does not sleep. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly distribution</a>.</p><p>Riders and walkers bear the load: since 2022, CB8 logged <strong>209 injured cyclists</strong> (one killed) and <strong>331 injured pedestrians</strong> (two killed). People inside vehicles are hurt most by count, but those on foot or bike are exposed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Mode split</a>.</p><h3 id=rogers-pacific-bedford-the-side-streets-bleed-too>Rogers, Pacific, Bedford: the side streets bleed too</h3><ul><li>Rogers Avenue: one death, 21 injuries. A 37‑year‑old on an e‑bike died after striking a parked box truck in 2023. The city record cites “Pavement Defective.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Top intersections; CrashID 4692318</a>.</li><li>Pacific Street: one death, 45 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Top intersections</a>.</li><li>Bedford Avenue and Eastern Parkway each show dozens of injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Top intersections</a>.</li></ul><p>The city’s own factor table for CB8 lists “other” as the largest bucket tied to deaths (three), with smaller tallies for vulnerable‑road‑user error (one) and traces of distraction, failure to yield, and unsafe speed across injuries. The pattern is messy, but the harm is plain. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Contributing factors</a>.</p><h3 id=trucks-in-the-kill-zone>Trucks in the kill zone</h3><p>On Atlantic, the death files keep pairing people with big rigs. A 2022 tractor truck crash at Atlantic. A 2024 box truck in a fatal on Atlantic. A refrigerated van in a fatal motorcycle strike nearby. The <strong>trucks and buses</strong> share a small slice of total pedestrian cases but carry outsize harm, including <strong>one pedestrian death</strong> in CB8’s rollup. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>Vehicles and persons tables</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-call-to-next-of-kin>What would stop the next call to next of kin?</h3><p>Local fixes that match the map:</p><ul><li>Daylight Atlantic, Rogers, and Pacific. Ban parking at crosswalks and harden corners. Council bill <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a> would scale this up citywide with barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. Council Member Chi Ossé is a co‑sponsor, per council records.</li><li>Harden turns and add leading walk signals and turn‑calming on Atlantic at Kingston, Bedford, and Clinton. Protect bike moves where cyclists keep getting hit.</li><li>Target trucks on Atlantic and Rogers. Set truck‑safe routing and frequent checks where the fatalities cluster.</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-moves-that-cut-the-body-count>Citywide moves that cut the body count</h3><p>Albany gave the city power to set lower speeds. The law is on the books. Our city can drop residential limits. The choice is political. See our <a href=/take_action/>action guide</a>.</p><p>There’s also a state bill to stop the worst repeat drivers by force‑limiting their cars. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> advanced in June. Senator Zellnor Myrie co‑sponsored it, but he missed two committee votes on June 11 and 12. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States: S 4045</a>. The bill would require speed limiters for people who rack up heavy violations. This is aimed at the few who do the most harm.</p><h3 id=two-dead-in-the-trains-shadow>Two dead in the trains’ shadow</h3><p>This board spans subway stations where lives ended this summer. At Prospect Park, a fight spilled to the rails. “He landed on the train tracks and was struck by an oncoming train,” police said. He died at the scene. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/30/man-fatally-struck-by-train-after-tumbling-onto-brooklyn-subway-tracks-during-fight/>NY Daily News</a>. Days later, two more people died on the tracks in separate incidents citywide; police said, “No criminality is suspected.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=keep-the-pressure-on>Keep the pressure on</h3><ul><li>Lower speeds on local streets. <strong>Twenty saves.</strong></li><li>Lock repeat speeders to the limit with mandated speed tech.</li><li>Daylight and harden the corners where people keep falling.</li></ul><p>These are not theories. They are choices. The death files on Atlantic are already written. The next one is not.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and Albany to move.

A 2009 BMW SUV with three occupants was traveling westbound when it was impacted on its left side doors by a 2024 box truck also traveling westbound. The box truck sustained no damage, while the SUV’s left side doors were damaged. The SUV’s driver, a 41-year-old woman, and two passengers, aged 47 and 66, all suffered upper arm shoulder injuries and were in shock. The report lists no specific contributing factors or driver errors such as failure to yield or reckless driving. Both drivers were licensed in their respective states. The severity of injuries and damage to the SUV’s side underscores the vulnerability of vehicle occupants in side-impact collisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
