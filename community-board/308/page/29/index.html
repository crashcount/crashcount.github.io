He walked with his sister. A black SUV struck him. The driver stayed. The boy did not. Police said, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>&ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister.&rdquo;</a> No arrest. The street stayed open. The city moved on.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous,&rdquo; a neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said</a> by the tape.</p><p>In the last year, Brooklyn CB8 saw 1 death, 5 serious injuries, and 388 people hurt in 693 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=the-toll-and-the-tools>The Toll and the Tools</h3><p>Cars and trucks did the most harm. In three and a half years, they killed 3, seriously injured 5, and hurt 254 more. Motorcycles and mopeds left 8 injured. Bikes, 9. The street is not neutral. It picks its victims.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Members <a href=/council-district/36/>Chi Ossé</a> and <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and support the SAFE Streets Act. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>They co-sponsored a bill</a> to keep cars away from crosswalks—still stuck in committee. They called for a full redesign of Atlantic Avenue. But the city moves slow. The dead do not wait.</p><p>Senator <a href=/senate-district/20/>Zellnor Myrie</a> rode the streets, saw the blocked lanes, and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>said</a>, &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every crash is a choice made by the city. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action, not delay. The street will not change itself. You must force it.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Members Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Crystal Hudson, whose districts border or include the park, call for a new policy to allow e-assist bikes. The article states, 'This policy is discriminatory and ableist, and harmful to climate goals.' Hanif notes e-bikes enabled her to ride after hip surgery. The ban forces riders onto dangerous streets, blocks access for families and people with limited mobility, and invites selective NYPD enforcement.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) postponed its presentation on making the open street permanent after Hudson raised concerns. The matter summary states: 'implementation – especially the 'Limited Local Access' model – and communication... has been flawed.' Hudson, who has supported open space and pedestrian safety, now emphasizes community engagement, saying, 'Every voice, including dissenting voices, must be heard.' She suggests changes to better accommodate all residents. Data shows the open street is safer, with fewer crashes and more non-drivers using the space.

The matter, titled 'Brooklyn Pols: Fix Grand Army Plaza and Make it Safer,' calls for more protected bike lanes, speed bumps, improved traffic signals, and completion of stalled capital work. The councilmembers cited ongoing crashes, injuries, and community complaints about dangerous conditions. They requested a comprehensive traffic study and highlighted support from over 2,000 neighbors and local advocacy groups. DOT responded that it would review the letter and meet with the community. The push comes as past improvements have failed to end the threat to pedestrians and cyclists.
