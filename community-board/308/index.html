The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> advanced in June.

Cyclists vow legal action if injuries follow. Over 200 sign a pledge. The mayor moves ahead, ignoring proven safety gains.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-07-15) reports Brooklyn cyclists pledged to sue if the city removes protected bike lanes on Bedford Avenue and injuries result. Over 200 signed a pledge after Mayor Adams decided to strip three blocks of protection, despite city data showing the lanes made the street 'dramatically safer.' The move follows a court ruling allowing the change. City Hall claims the redesign addresses 'serious safety concerns.' Legal precedent (Turturro v. City of New York) could hold the city liable for knowingly making streets less safe. Advocates see the decision as political, not safety-driven.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
