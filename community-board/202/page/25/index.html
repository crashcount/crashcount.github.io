Harden turns and add daylighting at Bruckner Boulevard and Leggett Avenue. Give leading pedestrian intervals on <strong>Westchester Avenue</strong> and <strong>Southern Boulevard</strong>. Set truck‑safe routing and slower turns at Oak Point and Tiffany.</p><p>The pattern is clear. The next steps are, too: slow the cars and stop the repeat speeders.
