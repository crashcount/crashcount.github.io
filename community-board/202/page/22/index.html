Same ending.</p><p>Police say a 21‑year‑old driving a Mercedes on the Bronx River Parkway tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck two motorcycles. Both riders were thrown and died. Prosecutors charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. “A drunken BMW driver fatally struck two motorcyclists,” police told the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/11/bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>Daily News</a>. Gothamist named the victims: Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. The DA’s complaint said the driver had a strong odor of alcohol; he later refused a chemical test, according to <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>. “Two people were killed. He was drunk,” a sister said at court, as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Daily News</a>.</p><p>The southbound lanes closed near Gun Hill. The city reopened the road. The families do not.</p><h3 id=nights-are-the-kill-hours>Nights are the kill hours</h3><p>Across Bronx Community Board 2, nights bite hard. Injury spikes build from late evening into the night: 9 p.m. sees 143 injuries, then 86 at 10 p.m., 59 at 11 p.m. Early mornings stay bloody too: 62 injuries at midnight, 28 at 2 a.m., 15 at 3 a.m., 39 at 5 a.m., 37 at 6 a.m., 65 at 7 a.m. The tally comes from city crash data for 2022–2025 in this district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Pedestrians hurt most often when struck by sedans and SUVs here. Trucks kill too. In this area since 2022: SUVs and cars account for 206 pedestrian injury cases with three deaths; trucks and buses for 30 cases with one death (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=five-corners-that-dont-let-you-go>Five corners that don’t let you go</h3><p>The map repeats itself. Westchester Avenue carries two deaths and 52 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bruckner Boulevard</a> shows 271 injuries. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bruckner Expressway</a> adds 96 injuries and a death. Southern Boulevard and Hunts Point Ave each show serious injuries too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Contributing factors recorded in this community board put most harm in “other,” with five deaths and 382 injuries. Failures we know by name show up too: vulnerable road user error (three deaths), inattention, failure to yield, disregarded signals (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Three fixes fit these blocks: daylight the corners on Westchester and Hunts Point; add hardened turns and LPIs on Southern; calm Bruckner Boulevard with protected space and fewer lanes. Target the repeat hotspots at night.</p><h3 id=officials-know-what-works--do-they>Officials know what works — do they?</h3><p>Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, keeping a tool that cuts speeding where it watches. The fight now is citywide speed and repeat offenders. Sammy’s Law gives the city power to lower limits. The ask is simple: a lower default saves lives. Our own reporting lays out the case and the steps to take in <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>The state’s Stop Super Speeders bill would force speed limiters on drivers who rack up violations. One driver with 29 camera tickets killed a mother and two daughters in April, advocates note. The bill, S4045, advanced in committee in June; local senators Jose Serrano and Luis Sepúlveda voted yes, and both joined as co‑sponsors (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</p><h3 id=the-toll-is-local>The toll is local</h3><p>Since 2022 in this district: 10 people dead, 1,630 injured, 24 seriously hurt. Pedestrians account for four of those deaths and 242 injuries. Cyclists: one dead, 103 injured. Occupants: five dead, 1,244 injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>One corner, one night, one family. Then another.</p><p>Bold tools exist. <strong>Lower speeds. Stop repeat speeders.</strong> If you want it to change, start here: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
