The bill summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing the fines for the unlawful use of all-terrain vehicles and dirt bikes.' Council Member Carmen N. De La Rosa led as primary sponsor, joined by Salamanca, Louis, Brewer, Joseph, Yeger, Dinowitz, and Sanchez. The measure would have raised first-offense fines to $750 and subsequent offenses to $1,500. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. No safety analyst assessment was provided. The city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—remain at risk from illegal vehicle use.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s summary reads: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring reports on police department response times to minor traffic crashes.” Council Members Rita C. Joseph (primary sponsor), Rafael Salamanca, Jr., and Diana I. Ayala backed the measure. The bill demanded data on whether pedestrians were involved and if injuries occurred, with details by precinct, borough, and zip code. It also called for annual NYPD recommendations to cut response times. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and never became law.
