Harden turns and add daylighting at Bruckner Boulevard and Leggett Avenue. Give leading pedestrian intervals on <strong>Westchester Avenue</strong> and <strong>Southern Boulevard</strong>. Set truck‑safe routing and slower turns at Oak Point and Tiffany.</p><p>The pattern is clear. The next steps are, too: slow the cars and stop the repeat speeders.

One vehicle, a 2018 Honda SUV, was making a left turn while the other, a 2005 Toyota SUV, was traveling straight. The report explicitly lists 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor in the crash. The impact was severe: a 36-year-old woman, driving one of the vehicles, was ejected and suffered severe lacerations to her leg. She remained conscious at the scene, with blood visible on the street and her airbag deployed. The police report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor.
