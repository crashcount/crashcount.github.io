The deal emerged during negotiations over the 'City of Yes for Economic Opportunity' zoning plan, which the Council approved. The matter summary notes, 'the administration has pledged to support future legislation to cut pollution from these warehouses and propose rules to restrict new facilities.' Councilmember Alexa Avilés (District 38) and 28 colleagues sent a letter demanding stricter oversight. Avilés and advocates want special permits and environmental reviews to protect neighborhoods from traffic, pollution, and safety hazards. Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer promised a bill empowering the Department of Environmental Protection to regulate warehouse vehicle emissions. Councilmember Rafael Salamanca Jr. stressed the Council’s leverage: 'It gets to a point where you have to use your power of voting to get the attention of the city.' The City Planning Commission and Council must vote again before rules take effect.
