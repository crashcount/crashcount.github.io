Same ending.</p><p>Police say a 21‑year‑old driving a Mercedes on the Bronx River Parkway tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck two motorcycles. Both riders were thrown and died. Prosecutors charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. “A drunken BMW driver fatally struck two motorcyclists,” police told the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/11/bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>Daily News</a>. Gothamist named the victims: Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. The DA’s complaint said the driver had a strong odor of alcohol; he later refused a chemical test, according to <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>. “Two people were killed. He was drunk,” a sister said at court, as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Daily News</a>.</p><p>The southbound lanes closed near Gun Hill. The city reopened the road. The families do not.</p><h3 id=nights-are-the-kill-hours>Nights are the kill hours</h3><p>Across Bronx Community Board 2, nights bite hard. Injury spikes build from late evening into the night: 9 p.m. sees 143 injuries, then 86 at 10 p.m., 59 at 11 p.m. Early mornings stay bloody too: 62 injuries at midnight, 28 at 2 a.m., 15 at 3 a.m., 39 at 5 a.m., 37 at 6 a.m., 65 at 7 a.m. The tally comes from city crash data for 2022–2025 in this district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Pedestrians hurt most often when struck by sedans and SUVs here. Trucks kill too. In this area since 2022: SUVs and cars account for 206 pedestrian injury cases with three deaths; trucks and buses for 30 cases with one death (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=five-corners-that-dont-let-you-go>Five corners that don’t let you go</h3><p>The map repeats itself. Westchester Avenue carries two deaths and 52 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bruckner Boulevard</a> shows 271 injuries. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bruckner Expressway</a> adds 96 injuries and a death. Southern Boulevard and Hunts Point Ave each show serious injuries too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Contributing factors recorded in this community board put most harm in “other,” with five deaths and 382 injuries. Failures we know by name show up too: vulnerable road user error (three deaths), inattention, failure to yield, disregarded signals (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Three fixes fit these blocks: daylight the corners on Westchester and Hunts Point; add hardened turns and LPIs on Southern; calm Bruckner Boulevard with protected space and fewer lanes. Target the repeat hotspots at night.</p><h3 id=officials-know-what-works--do-they>Officials know what works — do they?</h3><p>Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, keeping a tool that cuts speeding where it watches. The fight now is citywide speed and repeat offenders. Sammy’s Law gives the city power to lower limits. The ask is simple: a lower default saves lives. Our own reporting lays out the case and the steps to take in <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>The state’s Stop Super Speeders bill would force speed limiters on drivers who rack up violations. One driver with 29 camera tickets killed a mother and two daughters in April, advocates note. The bill, S4045, advanced in committee in June; local senators Jose Serrano and Luis Sepúlveda voted yes, and both joined as co‑sponsors (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</p><h3 id=the-toll-is-local>The toll is local</h3><p>Since 2022 in this district: 10 people dead, 1,630 injured, 24 seriously hurt. Pedestrians account for four of those deaths and 242 injuries. Cyclists: one dead, 103 injured. Occupants: five dead, 1,244 injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>One corner, one night, one family. Then another.</p><p>Bold tools exist. <strong>Lower speeds. Stop repeat speeders.</strong> If you want it to change, start here: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Rafael Salamanca (D-Concourse Village) pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, stating, "There is no borough commissioner in the borough of the Bronx." The Bronx has lacked a permanent commissioner since November 2021. Salamanca demanded a timeline for filling the role, arguing, "There needs to be a level of accountability and our level of accountability is reaching out to that borough commissioner. Please speed it up." DOT responded that street safety projects are not planned or implemented by borough commissioners, but Salamanca insisted the vacancy leaves the Bronx exposed as crashes and injuries rise. All other boroughs have commissioners.
