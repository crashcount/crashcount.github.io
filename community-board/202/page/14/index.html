The bill summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing the fines for the unlawful use of all-terrain vehicles and dirt bikes.' Council Member Carmen N. De La Rosa led as primary sponsor, joined by Salamanca, Louis, Brewer, Joseph, Yeger, Dinowitz, and Sanchez. The measure would have raised first-offense fines to $750 and subsequent offenses to $1,500. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance.
