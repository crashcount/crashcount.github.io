The bill sits with the Senate, awaiting committee action. Its matter title reads: 'Establishes a bicycle and electric scooter operator's safety manual; provides for the issuance of a license...; requires liability insurance for electric scooters in cities having a population of one million or more.' Primary sponsor Luis R. Sepúlveda (District 32) and co-sponsor Joseph P. Addabbo Jr. (District 15) back the measure. S 5801 would require e-scooter riders in New York City to pass a safety manual, obtain a license, and buy insurance. It also bans sales to unlicensed, uninsured buyers. The bill's impact on vulnerable road users is not assessed. Lawmakers claim it will curb reckless riding, but the real effect on street safety remains unmeasured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report notes the child was a pedestrian not at an intersection, engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway,' but lists driver errors first and foremost.

The wall broke. Debris rained down. No one was hurt. The bus hung for hours, a warning of danger above Kappock Street.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on January 17, 2025, that a BxM1 MTA bus partially drove off the Henry Hudson Parkway overpass near Kappock Street after the driver swerved to avoid a double-parked car. The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly bill A 2299 targets repeat violators. The law would require intelligent speed assistance devices. The goal: stop reckless drivers before they kill.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A 2299, now in sponsorship, sits with the New York State Assembly. Introduced January 17, 2025, it awaits committee review. The bill summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, and others. No votes have been recorded yet. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving by forcing speed limiters on offenders. This targets a core threat to pedestrians and cyclists: unchecked speed and repeat lawbreaking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
