The driver starts the engine. The man never wakes up. &ldquo;Nobody checks under their car to see if someone is there,&rdquo; a worker named Omar told the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/17/man-sleeping-under-box-truck-crushed-dead-hunts-point-bronx/>NY Daily News</a>. In Bronx CB2, the dead do not get names. In the last twelve months, <strong>three people died</strong> in crashes. <strong>Three more were left with injuries so severe they may never heal</strong>. <strong>449 were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the damage.</strong> In the past three years, they killed three people and left dozens with broken bodies. Trucks and SUVs struck down pedestrians. Sedans crushed cyclists and drivers. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone in between. Children were hurt—<strong>123 under 18 injured since 2022</strong>. The violence is steady, unyielding. It does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They pass laws like Sammy’s Law, which lets New York lower speed limits. But in Bronx CB2, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city added some protected bike lanes and crosswalks, but the danger remains. <strong>No local leader has stood in front of a camera here to say, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Every injury is a failure. The city can lower speed limits. It can harden crosswalks. It can put cameras on every corner. But it will not happen unless you demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Stand with the families who have lost everything. <strong>Do not let another year pass with more bodies in the road.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
