One woman, 18, left fighting for her life. The crash came on the Hutchinson River Parkway, near Throggs Neck. A Honda Accord hit a Honda Pilot. The Pilot slammed into a Razor scooter. The young woman and her companion were thrown onto the road. The driver of the scooter sped off, leaving her behind. Six others from the cars went to the hospital. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>Police said the moped driver sped away from the 3:45 a.m. crash on the Hutchinson River Parkway, just north of the Whitestone Bridge, leaving the young woman to die on the road.</a></p><p>This is not rare. It is routine. In the last twelve months, nine people died and 614 were injured in traffic crashes in Bronx CB9. Fifteen suffered injuries so severe they may never recover. Two of the dead were children. The numbers do not flinch.</p><h3 id=the-old-and-the-young>The Old and the Young</h3><p>A 75-year-old man, Wahid Miah, was killed crossing Wood Avenue. He had the light. A BMW SUV turned left and struck him. He tried to wave the driver off. The driver did not stop in time. &ldquo;The accident is so terrible,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-fatally-striking-75-year-old-man-walking-home-from-mosque/>said Miah&rsquo;s neighbor</a>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>A 17-year-old was killed riding a motorcycle on East 172nd Street. A 19-year-old pedestrian died on the Bruckner Expressway. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for bills to slow cars on Open Streets, add speed humps near parks, and require more safety signs near schools. She co-sponsored a bill to clarify pedestrian rights. Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. But the carnage continues. Laws that warn, nudge, or study do not stop a car in the crosswalk.</p><p>Most crashes here are not fate. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by city planners, by those who hold power and wait.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every deadly stretch. Demand real redesigns, not just signs.</p><p>Do not let another child, another elder, another neighbor become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Aging trains, tracks, and tunnels wait for repairs. Riders and advocates demand action. Uncertainty grows as leaders debate how to fund essential transit upgrades. Vulnerable users remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the MTA capital plan funding debate as of July 30, 2024. The MTA’s 2025-29 capital program, discussed at the Capital Program Committee meeting, remains unfunded after Governor Hochul’s indefinite delay of congestion pricing. The matter centers on the need for new rail cars, power stations, and repairs to tracks and tunnels. MTA President of Construction and Development Jamie Torres-Springer stressed, 'We need to achieve 100 percent state-of-good-repair.' State Senator Jeremy Cooney challenged the governor to restore funding or implement congestion pricing within 100 days. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein urged, 'Gov. Hochul must start congestion pricing now to rebuild trust.' The MTA is $15 billion short on its 2020-24 plan, with no clear path forward. Transit advocates warn that underfunding public transit puts riders—especially those on foot or bike—at continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
