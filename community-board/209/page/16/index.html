This year, through mid‑August, at least 3 people were killed and 11 were seriously injured in CB9 (city data).</p><p>This week</p><p>Two riders died on the Bronx River Parkway after a driver allegedly struck multiple vehicles and mopeds. Police and local reporting identified the victims and say the driver was arrested on vehicular manslaughter and DWI charges. A victim’s sister asked in court: “He’s just walking freely? Two people were killed. He was drunk. Think about how he took two lives. That’s not fair.” (NY Daily News).</p><p>When and where we break</p><p>Nights are deadliest. Midnight to 4 a.m. saw nine deaths in CB9 since 2022 (city data). The district’s repeat hotspots include Westchester Avenue and the Bruckner/Cross‑Bronx corridors, with White Plains Road also ranking high. These are repeat scenes, not one‑offs.</p><p>Why it keeps happening</p><p>City data point to common causes: alcohol involvement, driver inattention/distraction, and unsafe speed are recurring factors. Cars and SUVs do most of the killing and serious harm in CB9. The pattern is metal and speed.</p><p>Local fixes we can build now</p><ul><li>Daylight crossings and install Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs) at Westchester Avenue and White Plains Road.</li><li>Harden turning radii and add curb extensions on expressway service roads to slow entries and exits.</li><li>Improve night lighting and run targeted DWI saturation patrols on Bruckner ramps and Bronx River Parkway approaches.</li></ul><p>Political solutions — local to citywide</p><p>Local design and enforcement will save lives, but citywide policy must change too. New York must lower its default speed limit and require speed‑limiting technology for habitual speeders. State legislation pushing intelligent speed assistance devices — S4045 in the Senate and A2299 in the Assembly — would force repeat offenders to drive cars that cannot exceed the limit by large margins (see S4045, A2299). Those measures pair with local daylighting and LPIs to cut deaths now.</p><p>Who’s acting — and who isn’t</p><p>State Sen. Nathalia Fernández voted yes in committee on S4045, a step toward speed limiters for repeat offenders (S4045). Assembly Member Karines Reyes is a co‑sponsor of A2299 and supports related bills on owner liability for camera violations (A2299, A5440). The state has also discussed a car‑free connector alongside the Cross‑Bronx, an idea that would pull people off the highway edge and give them safe space to walk and bike (Streetsblog).</p><p>What to demand</p><p>Call your council member in District 18, your assembly member in AD 85, and your state senator in SD 34. Demand: a 20 mph default across NYC; passage of S4045/A2299 to require speed limiters for repeat offenders; and local fixes — daylighting, LPIs, hardened turns, better night lighting, and targeted DWI enforcement — at Westchester Ave, White Plains Rd, and Bruckner approaches.</p><p>Don’t wait for the next body to cool on the asphalt.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
