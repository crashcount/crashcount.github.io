Same ending.</p><p>Police say a 21-year-old in a Mercedes tried to pass on the Bronx River Parkway and hit a Volkswagen, then two bikes. Two riders were thrown to the road and died. Their names were Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. The driver, Mauricio Neyra Yuyes, was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, according to <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>amNY</a>. “Neyra Yuyes was arrested… He faces a list of charges including vehicular manslaughter, driving while intoxicated,” the paper wrote. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> reported he “had a strong odor of alcohol on his breath” in a complaint filing. A sister stood outside court and said, “Two people were killed. He was drunk,” per the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Daily News</a>.</p><p>The highway closed near Gun Hill. Southbound lanes went dark while police worked, as first reported by <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/2-killed-1-taken-into-custody-in-multivehicle-bronx-river-parkway-crash-nypd-says>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>Nights tell the tale</p><p>In Bronx CB9, harm piles up after dark. Midnight. One a.m. Four a.m. The hours with the worst death counts are 0:00, 4:00, 14:00, and 23:00, with late night and pre-dawn standing out. From 2022 to now, the board logged 23 deaths and 2,518 injuries. Pedestrians took 423 injuries and eight deaths. Riders on two wheels were hit too: cyclists, mopeds, and motorcycles together saw hundreds hurt and four killed. The city’s own data marks heavy injury totals on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Westchester Avenue</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>White Plains Road</a>, the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Cross Bronx</a>, and the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bruckner Expressway</a>.</p><p>The causes repeat. “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” “Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.” “Unsafe Speed.” “Alcohol Involvement.” The city’s rollup shows SUVs and cars doing most of the damage to people on foot. Five pedestrian deaths tied to SUVs in this area; sedans killed too. This is not one crash. It is a pattern in the record, line after line in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><p>Westchester Avenue is a wound. 108 injuries and a death since 2022. White Plains Road is another, with 111 injuries and two deaths. The Cross Bronx and Bruckner stack bodies and broken bones above the neighborhood. These places need simple, proven work: daylighting at corners, hardened lefts, longer walk starts, raised crossings near bus stops. Nighttime trouble demands lights, speed control, and repeated sweeps where the data says to go. Start with the listed hot spots. The map already points the way in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city’s crash files</a>.</p><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany moved some pieces. School‑zone speed cameras run 24/7 through 2030. Senators and Assembly Members from the Bronx voted yes, according to the session record on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>. Another bill aims at repeat speeders. The Stop Super Speeders Act, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>, would force drivers with a pattern of points or camera tickets to use speed limiters. Senator Nathalia Fernández backed it in committee votes on June 11 and 12. Assembly Member Karines Reyes co‑sponsors the Assembly version. The paper trail is there.</p><p>City Hall holds a stronger lever. Sammy’s Law lets the city set lower limits. A default 20 mph citywide would cut the energy of every crash. It would give walkers a chance. It would give riders a chance. The case is laid out in our <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a> page with contacts and scripts.</p><p>A ledger of loss</p><p>A 75‑year‑old man, crossing with the signal at White Plains Road and Wood Avenue, was killed by a left‑turning BMW SUV. The record says “Failure to Yield” and “Driver Inattention.” That was February 3, 2025, in the city dataset for crash <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4790185</a>.</p><p>A 19‑year‑old pedestrian died on the Bruckner Expressway. The file lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” That was October 21, 2024, crash <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4765230</a>.</p><p>Two men on mopeds died on the Bronx River Parkway. Their names are in the stories above. Their families wait in court hallways. “How could they let him go?” a mother asked, in the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Daily News</a>.</p><p>The list goes on. The hours tick by. The next phone call will come.</p><p>What now</p><ul><li>Fix the worst corners first: Westchester Avenue and White Plains Road need daylighting, hardened turns, and longer walk phases, guided by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a>.</li><li>Hit the night shift: target late‑night and pre‑dawn hours the data flags, with lighting and enforcement at repeat hot spots.</li><li>Stop the super speeders: pass and enforce <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>/<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a> to put speed limiters on the worst repeat offenders.</li><li>Lower the speed: use Sammy’s Law powers. <strong>Set 20 mph as the city’s default.</strong></li></ul><p>One call matters.

The signs tell passengers: look for cyclists before you open up. A small step. The city hands out the decals. No cost to drivers.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0193-2024 became law on May 31, 2025, after action by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...requiring taxis and for-hire vehicles to display a decal warning passengers to look for cyclists when opening the door,' was sponsored by Lincoln Restler and co-sponsored by over twenty council members, including Gutiérrez, Hudson, and Rivera. The law mandates clear warning decals on all rear passenger doors of taxis and for-hire vehicles. The Taxi and Limousine Commission will provide the signs at no cost. The measure aims to cut down on 'dooring'—a threat to cyclists citywide. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
