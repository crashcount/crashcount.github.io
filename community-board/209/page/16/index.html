Eleven more left with serious injuries.</strong> In the same period, 616 were hurt. The dead include a 17-year-old boy, a 75-year-old man, a 64-year-old man, a 19-year-old, and a 27-year-old woman. Some were walking. Some were riding. None came home.</p><p>On a Monday night in February, <strong>Juan Alexander Quizhpi Naranjo, age 17, was thrown from his bike at Metcalf Avenue and East 172nd Street.</strong> He died at Jacobi Hospital. His 14-year-old passenger survived. His father remembered, &ldquo;When he didn&rsquo;t return in the evening I tried calling him but he didn&rsquo;t pick up. Later his mom called him many times but no one picked up. Then around 7 p.m. someone picked up his phone and asked us to come to the hospital,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/25/dirt-bike-minivan-bronx-crash-juan-alexander-quizhpi-naranjo/>said Juan Avendano</a>. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The investigation goes on. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-intersections-inattention-and-the-young>The Pattern: Intersections, Inattention, and the Young</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In the last twelve months, two people under 18 were killed. Another 72 were injured. The old are not spared. One man, 75, was killed crossing with the signal. The driver turned left in a new BMW. The police said the cause was &ldquo;failure to yield right-of-way&rdquo; and &ldquo;driver inattention/distraction.&rdquo; Police said, &ldquo;Both teens were thrown from the bike and rushed to Jacobi Hospital. The older victim succumbed to his injuries while the girl was in stable condition&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/bronx-teen-dies-in-traffic-crash-another-teen-injured-nypd-says>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>SUVs and sedans strike most often. <strong>SUVs alone killed four pedestrians in the last three years.</strong> Trucks, buses, and bikes also injure, but the weight of death comes on four wheels.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-power-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Power, and the Waiting</h2><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council and the Mayor can act. They have not. Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% where installed, but the law that keeps them running is again at risk of expiring. The city touts intersection redesigns and new bike lanes, but the deaths keep coming.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p><h2 id=act-now-demand-action-not-excuses>Act Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.</strong> Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.
