One woman, 18, left fighting for her life. The crash came on the Hutchinson River Parkway, near Throggs Neck. A Honda Accord hit a Honda Pilot. The Pilot slammed into a Razor scooter. The young woman and her companion were thrown onto the road. The driver of the scooter sped off, leaving her behind. Six others from the cars went to the hospital. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>Police said the moped driver sped away from the 3:45 a.m. crash on the Hutchinson River Parkway, just north of the Whitestone Bridge, leaving the young woman to die on the road.</a></p><p>This is not rare. It is routine. In the last twelve months, nine people died and 614 were injured in traffic crashes in Bronx CB9. Fifteen suffered injuries so severe they may never recover. Two of the dead were children. The numbers do not flinch.</p><h3 id=the-old-and-the-young>The Old and the Young</h3><p>A 75-year-old man, Wahid Miah, was killed crossing Wood Avenue. He had the light. A BMW SUV turned left and struck him. He tried to wave the driver off. The driver did not stop in time. &ldquo;The accident is so terrible,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-fatally-striking-75-year-old-man-walking-home-from-mosque/>said Miah&rsquo;s neighbor</a>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>A 17-year-old was killed riding a motorcycle on East 172nd Street. A 19-year-old pedestrian died on the Bruckner Expressway. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for bills to slow cars on Open Streets, add speed humps near parks, and require more safety signs near schools. She co-sponsored a bill to clarify pedestrian rights. Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. But the carnage continues. Laws that warn, nudge, or study do not stop a car in the crosswalk.</p><p>Most crashes here are not fate. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by city planners, by those who hold power and wait.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every deadly stretch. Demand real redesigns, not just signs.</p><p>Do not let another child, another elder, another neighbor become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Change is now law.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0708-2022, now Local Law 171 of 2023, was enacted by the City Council on December 16, 2023, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law, sponsored by Gale A. Brewer with co-sponsors including Erik D. Bottcher, Lincoln Restler, and others, amends the city code to require the Department of Transportation to report on vehicles with license plates unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems. The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The reports must be public and sent to the Mayor and Council Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C.
