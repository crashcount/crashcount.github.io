One woman, 18, left fighting for her life. The crash came on the Hutchinson River Parkway, near Throggs Neck. A Honda Accord hit a Honda Pilot. The Pilot slammed into a Razor scooter. The young woman and her companion were thrown onto the road. The driver of the scooter sped off, leaving her behind. Six others from the cars went to the hospital. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>Police said the moped driver sped away from the 3:45 a.m. crash on the Hutchinson River Parkway, just north of the Whitestone Bridge, leaving the young woman to die on the road.</a></p><p>This is not rare. It is routine. In the last twelve months, nine people died and 614 were injured in traffic crashes in Bronx CB9. Fifteen suffered injuries so severe they may never recover. Two of the dead were children. The numbers do not flinch.</p><h3 id=the-old-and-the-young>The Old and the Young</h3><p>A 75-year-old man, Wahid Miah, was killed crossing Wood Avenue. He had the light. A BMW SUV turned left and struck him. He tried to wave the driver off. The driver did not stop in time. &ldquo;The accident is so terrible,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-fatally-striking-75-year-old-man-walking-home-from-mosque/>said Miah&rsquo;s neighbor</a>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>A 17-year-old was killed riding a motorcycle on East 172nd Street. A 19-year-old pedestrian died on the Bruckner Expressway. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for bills to slow cars on Open Streets, add speed humps near parks, and require more safety signs near schools. She co-sponsored a bill to clarify pedestrian rights. Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. But the carnage continues. Laws that warn, nudge, or study do not stop a car in the crosswalk.</p><p>Most crashes here are not fate. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by city planners, by those who hold power and wait.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every deadly stretch. Demand real redesigns, not just signs.</p><p>Do not let another child, another elder, another neighbor become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, introduced January 19, 2023, was sponsored by Council Member Farah N. Louis (primary), with Holden, Stevens, Restler, Farías, Richardson Jordan, and Schulman as co-sponsors. The resolution’s title reads: 'calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to allow seniors and people with disabilities to receive fare discounts on express buses during rush hours.' The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The move sought to make transit more accessible for vulnerable New Yorkers, who face rising fares and shrinking service.
