The driver did not stop. Police searched the alleyway where she was struck. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. No arrests have been made. The car kept going. The city stayed quiet. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/woman-fatally-struck-hit-run-crash-morris-heights-bronx/17460347/>A 44-year-old woman was fatally struck in a hit-and-run crash in the Bronx.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>nine people have died</strong> in traffic crashes in Bronx CB9. <strong>Sixteen more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The dead include children, elders, and workers. The living carry scars. The numbers do not slow. <strong>Over 1,200 crashes</strong> in a year. <strong>795 injured.</strong></p><h2 id=speed-and-the-cost-of-delay>Speed and the Cost of Delay</h2><p>Speed is the killer. In June, a cab driver died on a Bronx street. The SUV that hit him was going 77 mph in a 25 zone. The driver ran a red light, used the bus lane, and left the scene. The cab was pushed seventy feet. The driver, Robert Godwin, died in the hospital. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/08/us-news/bronx-woman-driving-77-mph-in-25-mph-zone-indicted-for-killing-cab-driver-da/>This defendant was allegedly driving three times the speed limit when her SUV slammed into a livery cab, and she fled the scene without checking on the driver&rsquo;s condition or waiting for first responders to arrive.</a></p><p>The story repeats. Pedestrians hit in crosswalks. Cyclists struck by turning trucks. Children hurt on the way to school. The road does not forgive. The city does not change fast enough.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. State Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. The bill passed committee. But the law is not yet in force. The streets are not yet safe. The council has voted to remove abandoned vehicles. The state has renewed speed cameras near schools. But the deaths keep coming. The silence is louder than the action.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, by the state, by those who hold the power to slow cars and protect people. <strong>Call your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets built for people, not cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
