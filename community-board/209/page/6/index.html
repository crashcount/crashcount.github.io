One woman, 18, left fighting for her life. The crash came on the Hutchinson River Parkway, near Throggs Neck. A Honda Accord hit a Honda Pilot. The Pilot slammed into a Razor scooter. The young woman and her companion were thrown onto the road. The driver of the scooter sped off, leaving her behind. Six others from the cars went to the hospital. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>Police said the moped driver sped away from the 3:45 a.m. crash on the Hutchinson River Parkway, just north of the Whitestone Bridge, leaving the young woman to die on the road.</a></p><p>This is not rare.

She co-sponsored a bill to clarify pedestrian rights. Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. But the carnage continues. Laws that warn, nudge, or study do not stop a car in the crosswalk.</p><p>Most crashes here are not fate. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by city planners, by those who hold power and wait.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every deadly stretch.

The report states: 'A sedan ran the light. Steel screamed.' The 27-year-old female front-seat passenger, who was wearing a seatbelt and protected by an airbag, suffered fatal injuries to her entire body. The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded,' highlighting the driver's failure to obey the traffic signal. No victim behavior was cited as contributing to the crash.

Now weighs bike and pedestrian path. Bronx officials and advocates push back against more lanes, more overpasses. Public left out. Final decision coming. Streets remain dangerous. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 5, 2024, the New York State Department of Transportation announced it is reconsidering its plan for a four-lane bypass road next to the Cross-Bronx Expressway. The agency now weighs three options: the original bypass, a bike-pedestrian path, or a two-lane road with a two-way bike lane. This shift follows a September letter from Bronx elected officials, including Assembly Member Karines Reyes, urging DOT to drop the bypass. The official matter summary states, 'DOT is now presenting three options as part of a $900-million project to rebuild five elevated sections of the expressway.' Environmental advocates remain opposed to more lanes and overpasses, wary of obscuring Starlight Park and the Bronx River. Daniel Ranells of the Bronx River Alliance said, 'We like east-west connections that make things safer for people who are walking and biking,' but called for better public involvement. DOT will release a draft environmental assessment and hold hearings this winter, with a final decision due in spring 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council passed it on October 23, 2024; it became law November 22, 2024, as Local Law 113. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the department of transportation posting information on traffic-control device and speed reducer requests on its website.” Council Member Kalman Yeger led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law orders DOT to publish every request for traffic signals and speed humps—case number, subject, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial, and timeline if approved. The public can now track what the city does, or fails to do, when streets need taming. This transparency exposes the machinery behind every crosswalk, signal, and speed bump—vital for anyone who walks, bikes, or rides in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
