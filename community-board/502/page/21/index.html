The crash happened just before dawn. The boy was left on the pavement, bleeding, while the bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>). The investigation drags on. No arrests. No answers.</p><p>A week earlier, a 16-year-old riding an e-scooter died after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The police said only that he suffered head trauma. His name was Nacere Ellis. He will not see seventeen.

The study, led by HDR, will look at expanding the bridge’s narrow lanes to meet federal standards and possibly adding more lanes. The matter summary states the goal is to 'relieve congestion and improve traffic flow.' State Senator Andrew Lanza pushed for the study, calling the bridge 'very narrow therefore very dangerous.' Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton acknowledged induced demand and said the study will consider all options, including a shared-use path for cyclists and pedestrians. Former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz opposed widening, urging investment in public transit instead. The study’s outcome could shape the future safety of vulnerable road users crossing between Staten Island and New Jersey.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
