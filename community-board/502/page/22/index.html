The dead include children, elders, and workers. The living carry scars. Since 2022, there have been <strong>11 deaths and 2,574 injuries</strong> in this district alone. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>Just last month, a 13-year-old boy was thrown from his moped and left with a shattered skull after colliding with an MTA bus at Castleton and Park Avenues. The crash happened just before dawn. The boy was left on the pavement, bleeding, while the bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>). The investigation drags on. No arrests. No answers.</p><p>A week earlier, a 16-year-old riding an e-scooter died after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The police said only that he suffered head trauma. His name was Nacere Ellis. He will not see seventeen.

The signs are unclear. The danger is not.</p><p><strong>Bills that could force repeat speeders to slow down have stalled.</strong> The Stop Super Speeders Act would require the worst offenders to install speed-limiting devices (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).
