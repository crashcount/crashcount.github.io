The crash happened just before dawn. The boy was left on the pavement, bleeding, while the bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>). The investigation drags on. No arrests. No answers.</p><p>A week earlier, a 16-year-old riding an e-scooter died after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The police said only that he suffered head trauma. His name was Nacere Ellis. He will not see seventeen.

The narrative states, 'A 66-year-old man struck while walking. Head split. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He stayed awake, blinking through pain.' The report provides no information about the driver or vehicle, noting, 'No name for the driver. No car description. Just silence and sirens.' The victim suffered a severe head injury with significant bleeding but remained conscious at the scene. The police report does not list any contributing factors or driver errors, and there is no mention of the pedestrian’s actions as a factor. The absence of driver identification and vehicle details underscores a systemic danger: a person can be gravely injured in the street, and the responsible driver can simply disappear, leaving only trauma and unanswered questions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way and was inattentive or distracted at the time of the crash. The report states, 'Steel met flesh. She dropped, broken. The driver did not yield.' The impact occurred at the left front quarter panel of the SUV, causing fatal crush injuries to the pedestrian's entire body. The woman was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, as noted in the report, but the primary contributing factors remain 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The driver was licensed and operating a 2023 SUV. The collision underscores the lethal consequences of driver error on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
