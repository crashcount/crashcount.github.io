The crash happened just before dawn. The boy was left on the pavement, bleeding, while the bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).

The lawmakers, joined by Senators Steven Rhoads and Bill Weber, criticized Lieber for 'losing the trust of commuters' and downplaying subway crime. They condemned the new $9 congestion pricing toll for Midtown, with Weber calling it 'tone deaf' and demanding repeal. The event summary reads: 'GOP pols push MTA boss to resign after brushing off transit crime as New York braces for even more taxes, fees.' The lawmakers oppose further taxes and fees to close the MTA’s $33 billion gap. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

The narrative states, 'A 66-year-old man struck while walking. Head split. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He stayed awake, blinking through pain.' The report provides no information about the driver or vehicle, noting, 'No name for the driver. No car description. Just silence and sirens.' The victim suffered a severe head injury with significant bleeding but remained conscious at the scene. The police report does not list any contributing factors or driver errors, and there is no mention of the pedestrian’s actions as a factor. The absence of driver identification and vehicle details underscores a systemic danger: a person can be gravely injured in the street, and the responsible driver can simply disappear, leaving only trauma and unanswered questions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The taxi impacted the center back end of the sedan. The crash involved three vehicles all traveling westbound, but the collision was between the taxi and the sedan. Two passengers in the sedan, a 19-year-old male and a 56-year-old female, both seated in the rear with lap belts and harnesses, sustained neck injuries and complained of whiplash. Both were conscious and not ejected. The report explicitly cites "Driver Inexperience" as a contributing factor to the crash. No other contributing factors or victim behaviors were noted.
