An SUV comes north on Hylan Boulevard. The man does not make it home. His name was Chaosheng Wu. He was 80. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same. No charges. No change. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>Police are still investigating the crash.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>five people died</strong> on Staten Island CB2 streets. <strong>Eight more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Seven hundred sixty-three were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h3><p><strong>SUVs and trucks kill.</strong> In this district, SUVs took three lives. Trucks took two. Buses, one. Cars, more. Bikes, none. The old and the young are not spared. Two people over 75 died. Two more between 55 and 64. One was 25. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the crashes. <strong>1,251 crashes in one year.</strong></p><p>The mayor stands before a pile of crushed mopeds.

The young die riding home. The city holds press events. The families hold funerals.</p><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

Borelli (District 51) joined seventeen other lawmakers in a federal lawsuit to block New York City’s $15 congestion pricing toll for Midtown Manhattan. The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation. The case highlights the political and environmental battle over how to fund and shape New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
