The crash happened just before dawn. The boy was left on the pavement, bleeding, while the bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>). The investigation drags on. No arrests. No answers.</p><p>A week earlier, a 16-year-old riding an e-scooter died after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The police said only that he suffered head trauma. His name was Nacere Ellis. He will not see seventeen.

The officers 'lost control of their marked cruiser and slammed into the front of a Mexican restaurant' after swerving to avoid a car making a U-turn. Both officers sustained minor injuries. Hours earlier in Manhattan, a Dodge Charger 'spinning out of control' struck a police officer, pinning him against his patrol vehicle. Witness Abi Aguirre described, 'He crashed into a sanitation car... then he's doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car.' Both the officer and the driver were hospitalized.

Danger passed, barely.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (March 9, 2025) reports a near-disaster on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. High winds sent a wooden board flying from a pickup truck into David Deng’s windshield. Dashcam footage shows the board shattering glass across Deng and his family. Deng told the outlet, "I was in complete shock," and described glass covering their clothes and seats. The truck driver had stopped earlier, apparently trying to secure the load. The incident highlights the risk of unsecured cargo on city bridges. No police report was filed at the time. The event underscores the persistent threat loose debris poses to all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
