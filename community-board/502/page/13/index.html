Introduced February 28, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to assess at least 100 speed camera locations each year for raised speed reducer feasibility. The bill reads: 'requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), David M. Carr, Sandra Ung, Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, and Vickie Paladino sponsor the measure. If DOT finds a location suitable, it must install a raised speed reducer within a year. DOT must also report annually, track changes in dangerous driving, and recommend if cameras are still needed. The bill aims to force physical changes where drivers speed, not just rely on cameras.

Borelli (District 51) joined seventeen other lawmakers in a federal lawsuit to block New York City’s $15 congestion pricing toll for Midtown Manhattan. The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation. The case highlights the political and environmental battle over how to fund and shape New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
