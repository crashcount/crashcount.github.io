An SUV comes north on Hylan Boulevard. The man does not make it home. His name was Chaosheng Wu. He was 80. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same. No charges. No change. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>Police are still investigating the crash.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>five people died</strong> on Staten Island CB2 streets. <strong>Eight more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Seven hundred sixty-three were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h3><p><strong>SUVs and trucks kill.</strong> In this district, SUVs took three lives. Trucks took two. Buses, one. Cars, more. Bikes, none. The old and the young are not spared. Two people over 75 died. Two more between 55 and 64. One was 25. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the crashes. <strong>1,251 crashes in one year.</strong></p><p>The mayor stands before a pile of crushed mopeds. He <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>says</a>, “New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, because we hear it all the time, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.” The police commissioner <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/super-smash-nyc-destroys-mopeds-e-bikes-as-mayor-celebrates-illegal-vehicle-crackdown>declares</a>, “This morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them.” The city crushes the machines. The streets crush the people.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-unfinished>The Work Left Unfinished</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city redesigns some intersections, but the blood keeps flowing. The old die crossing the street. The young die riding home. The city holds press events. The families hold funerals.</p><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brad Hoylman-Sigal (District 47) joined the debate over New York’s congestion pricing plan. The original $15 toll was paused by Governor Hochul in June. Now, officials consider a lower toll or alternatives to fund the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'we need congestion pricing.' The matter, titled 'MTA boss ‘thrilled’ Kathy Hochul eyeing lower congestion toll after NY gov indefinitely paused controversial scheme,' highlights the urgency of MTA financing. Assemblywoman Deborah Glick noted Hochul’s commitment to a replacement plan. The bill’s status remains in flux, with no committee or vote recorded. The safety impact for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—was not assessed.
