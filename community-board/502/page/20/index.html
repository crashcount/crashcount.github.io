An SUV comes north on Hylan Boulevard. The man does not make it home. His name was Chaosheng Wu. He was 80. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same. No charges. No change. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>Police are still investigating the crash.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>five people died</strong> on Staten Island CB2 streets. <strong>Eight more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Seven hundred sixty-three were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h3><p><strong>SUVs and trucks kill.</strong> In this district, SUVs took three lives. Trucks took two. Buses, one. Cars, more. Bikes, none. The old and the young are not spared. Two people over 75 died. Two more between 55 and 64. One was 25. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the crashes. <strong>1,251 crashes in one year.</strong></p><p>The mayor stands before a pile of crushed mopeds. He <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>says</a>, “New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, because we hear it all the time, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.” The police commissioner <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/super-smash-nyc-destroys-mopeds-e-bikes-as-mayor-celebrates-illegal-vehicle-crackdown>declares</a>, “This morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them.” The city crushes the machines. The streets crush the people.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-unfinished>The Work Left Unfinished</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city redesigns some intersections, but the blood keeps flowing. The old die crossing the street. The young die riding home. The city holds press events. The families hold funerals.</p><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.
