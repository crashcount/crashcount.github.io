The crash happened just before dawn. The boy was left on the pavement, bleeding, while the bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>). The investigation drags on. No arrests. No answers.</p><p>A week earlier, a 16-year-old riding an e-scooter died after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. The police said only that he suffered head trauma. His name was Nacere Ellis. He will not see seventeen.
