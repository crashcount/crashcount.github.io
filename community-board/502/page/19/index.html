A truck backs up. He is gone. On April 9, Leony Salcedo-Chevalier, 34, was crushed by a box truck at an Amazon warehouse on Gulf Avenue. Both men worked for subcontractors. The driver stayed. The NYPD Collision Investigation Squad took over. No charges. <a href=https://www.amny.com/police-fire/staten-island-amazon-warehouse-collision-04092025/>Police determined that a 40-year-old man, while operating a box truck, backed the vehicle up at the location but wound up striking a pedestrian, later identified as 34-year-old Leony Salcedo-Chevalier.</a></p><p>A few weeks earlier, Chaosheng Wu, 80, tried to cross Hylan Boulevard. A Ford Edge hit him. He died at the hospital. The driver stayed. No charges. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/10/staten-island-pedestrian-struck-suv-driver-block-from-home-chaosheng-wu/>The 65-year-old driver stayed at the scene and was not charged, but police are still investigating the crash.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, five people died in crashes in CB2. Eight suffered serious injuries. Seven hundred sixty-one were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and cars killed three. Trucks and buses killed three. Bikes killed none. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. The pattern is clear. The weight of steel decides who lives and who dies.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-waiting-and-whats-next>Leadership: Words, Waiting, and What’s Next</h2><p>The city says it is acting.

Cameras and lower speed limits are tools left on the shelf. The law allows the city to lower limits to 20 mph. It has not done so here.</p><h2 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor.
