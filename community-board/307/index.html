Two men stepped into the crosswalk at 52nd Street and Third Avenue. A BMW ran the red. The car did not slow. Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were hit and left in the street. Both died where they fell. The driver sped away. Police caught him later. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>told police</a>.</p><p>The men were trying to reach a food pantry. &ldquo;We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of two individuals in Sunset Park this morning. Our thoughts are with their families and loved ones. We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said City Harvest</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last 12 months, Brooklyn CB7 saw 2 killed, 6 seriously hurt, and over 700 injured in 1,031 crashes. In the first half of 2025, 1 person is dead, 4 are seriously hurt, and 420 are injured. The dead are mostly people on foot or bike. The old, the young, the ones with nowhere else to go.</p><h2 id=the-same-streets-the-same-danger>The Same Streets, The Same Danger</h2><p>Neighbors say drivers speed on that stretch. The city’s own data shows 59 crashes and 80 injuries in three blocks around the site in five years. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>reported CBS New York</a>. The blood dries, but the danger stays.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h2><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Council Member Alexa Avilés co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. Senator Andrew Gounardes voted to renew speed cameras and backed the Stop Super Speeders Act. Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes voted yes to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored a bill for speed limiters. But the citywide speed limit is still above 20 mph. Enforcement is slow. Cameras catch speeders, but repeat offenders keep driving. The laws are not enough. The dead keep coming.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets where the old and the hungry can cross and live. Do not wait for the next body in the road.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Judge Ventura issued a restraining order after Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld appealed the city’s move. The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.' The article highlights weak enforcement of parking rules and the city’s reversal against its own DOT’s safety plan. The case underscores how political pressure and lax enforcement can threaten vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Quemuel Arroyo, MTA’s chief accessibility officer, called it 'a crucial connection.' The new elevators mark the third Brooklyn station made accessible this year.

Police made an arrest.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published June 19, 2025), Chaquasia Pigford was arrested and charged with murder, manslaughter, reckless driving, unlicensed operation, and leaving the scene after allegedly killing Tiffany Cifuni on May 24 in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Prosecutors say Pigford rear-ended Cifuni, then stopped two blocks away. When Cifuni approached, Pigford 'refused to roll down her window or speak,' then accelerated, striking and dragging Cifuni. The article quotes Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle.' Pigford then made an illegal turn and fled. The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run driving and the dangers posed by unlicensed, reckless drivers operating stolen vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight against traffic violence continues.</p><p class=mb3>""The verdict came in a long time ago: speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone... At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I'm proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years."" -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the New York State Legislature reauthorized the city’s speed camera program for five more years, extending it until July 1, 2030. The bill passed both the Senate and Assembly and awaits Governor Hochul’s signature. The measure, described as 'possibly the most important street safety law on the books,' covers 750 school zones. Sen. Andrew Gounardes praised the program, saying, 'speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez credited advocates and lawmakers for the renewal. Amy Sohn supported the move. Safety analysts note that speed cameras reduce vehicle speeds and crashes, improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists without burdening them. The reauthorization marks a rare, clear win for vulnerable road users in the city’s ongoing battle against traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
