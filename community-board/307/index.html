Since 2022, <strong>13 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,148 have been injured</strong> in crashes. Twenty of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a blink, families left with empty chairs and hospital bills. In the last year alone, <strong>2 people died</strong> and <strong>664 were hurt</strong>. The dead are not numbers. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, struck by a turning sedan on 7th Avenue. A 30-year-old man, crushed by a truck on 60th Street. A 49-year-old cyclist, thrown and killed by a pickup at 53rd and 4th. The street is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed first.</strong> Trucks, sedans, SUVs—they do the killing. In the last three years, cars and trucks took 5 lives, motorcycles and mopeds 1, bikes none. The rest are left with broken bones, crushed limbs, and memories that do not heal. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in CB7, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city says, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> The words are right. The action is not enough. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it here. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is another risk, another family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras, more street redesigns, more action. Do not wait for another obituary.</p><p><strong>The street will not change itself. You have to make it happen.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Today we are celebrating the second station in Bay Ridge to have accessibility access." -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On July 8, 2025, the MTA opened two ADA-compliant elevators at Bay Ridge-95th Street station, Brooklyn. The project, backed by federal funds, finished under budget. Council Member Justin Brannan, State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis all praised the upgrade. Quemuel Arroyo, MTA’s chief accessibility officer, called it 'a crucial connection.' The new elevators mark the third Brooklyn station made accessible this year. Improved subway access encourages walking and cycling to transit, boosting safety for vulnerable users by increasing their numbers and visibility. The MTA must reach 95% accessibility by 2055.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police made an arrest.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published June 19, 2025), Chaquasia Pigford was arrested and charged with murder, manslaughter, reckless driving, unlicensed operation, and leaving the scene after allegedly killing Tiffany Cifuni on May 24 in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Prosecutors say Pigford rear-ended Cifuni, then stopped two blocks away. When Cifuni approached, Pigford 'refused to roll down her window or speak,' then accelerated, striking and dragging Cifuni. The article quotes Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle.' Pigford then made an illegal turn and fled. The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run driving and the dangers posed by unlicensed, reckless drivers operating stolen vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight against traffic violence continues.</p><p class=mb3>""The verdict came in a long time ago: speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone... At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I'm proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years."" -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the New York State Legislature reauthorized the city’s speed camera program for five more years, extending it until July 1, 2030. The bill passed both the Senate and Assembly and awaits Governor Hochul’s signature. The measure, described as 'possibly the most important street safety law on the books,' covers 750 school zones. Sen. Andrew Gounardes praised the program, saying, 'speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez credited advocates and lawmakers for the renewal. Amy Sohn supported the move. Safety analysts note that speed cameras reduce vehicle speeds and crashes, improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists without burdening them. The reauthorization marks a rare, clear win for vulnerable road users in the city’s ongoing battle against traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
