Two men stepped into the crosswalk at 52nd Street and Third Avenue. A BMW ran the red. The car did not slow. Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were hit and left in the street. Both died where they fell. The driver sped away. Police caught him later. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>told police</a>.</p><p>The men were trying to reach a food pantry. &ldquo;We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of two individuals in Sunset Park this morning. Our thoughts are with their families and loved ones. We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said City Harvest</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last 12 months, Brooklyn CB7 saw 2 killed, 6 seriously hurt, and over 700 injured in 1,031 crashes. In the first half of 2025, 1 person is dead, 4 are seriously hurt, and 420 are injured. The dead are mostly people on foot or bike. The old, the young, the ones with nowhere else to go.</p><h2 id=the-same-streets-the-same-danger>The Same Streets, The Same Danger</h2><p>Neighbors say drivers speed on that stretch. The city’s own data shows 59 crashes and 80 injuries in three blocks around the site in five years. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>reported CBS New York</a>. The blood dries, but the danger stays.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h2><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Council Member Alexa Avilés co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. Senator Andrew Gounardes voted to renew speed cameras and backed the Stop Super Speeders Act. Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes voted yes to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored a bill for speed limiters. But the citywide speed limit is still above 20 mph. Enforcement is slow. Cameras catch speeders, but repeat offenders keep driving. The laws are not enough. The dead keep coming.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets where the old and the hungry can cross and live. Do not wait for the next body in the road.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable road users remain exposed to reckless drivers.</p><p class=mb3>On May 23, 2022, the New York State legislature passed a bill allowing New York City to operate speed cameras 24/7. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick, originally included tougher measures: escalating fines, registration suspensions, and insurance reporting for repeat speeders. These provisions were stripped during negotiations, leaving only the round-the-clock camera operation. Assembly Member Glick said, 'keeping the cameras on 24/7 was that hill.' Mayor Eric Adams called it 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives.' Advocacy groups and lawmakers voiced frustration at Albany’s reluctance to adopt stronger safety tools. The final law removes blackout periods for cameras, but leaves dangerous drivers with fewer consequences. The bill passed despite disappointment over its dilution, exposing the limits of legislative action for street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, awaiting City Council and state approval, aims to keep cameras running nights and weekends—when 41% of crashes occur. The matter summary states: 'the Legislature is poised to do the right thing and allow the speed cameras...to keep operating around the clock.' Gounardes, a key advocate, joins Mayor Adams and crash victims’ families in support. The endorsement highlights that automated enforcement cuts reckless driving and reduces injuries. The deal falls short by lacking escalating penalties for repeat speeders and lasting only three years. Still, keeping cameras on at all hours is the most important fix, targeting the deadliest times for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill (no number given) led by State Senator Andrew Gounardes faces debate in Albany as of May 13, 2022. The bill seeks to renew and strengthen New York City’s school speed zone camera program, which is set to expire June 2. The measure would expand camera hours to 24/7 and increase penalties for repeat offenders, including insurance notification and license suspension. The committee and current status are not specified, but only nine legislative days remain. The bill summary states: 'New York City officials are in conflict with state lawmakers in Albany over the future of school speed zone cameras.' Gounardes is confident in renewal. Mayor Eric Adams and advocates want home rule for NYC on speed cameras and speed limits, but Albany resists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez urges lawmakers to use every tool to fight reckless driving. The bill’s fate will shape the city’s ability to protect pedestrians and cyclists from speeding drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in May 2022, aims to allow 24/7 automated enforcement and add penalties for repeat offenders, including registration suspensions. The matter summary: 'DOT officials said they’re negotiating amendments to Gounardes’ bill that would further crack down on reckless drivers, including a provision to let the city install cameras to ticket cars in bike lanes.' Gounardes stressed urgency: 'We cannot leave Albany without reauthorizing the speed cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s late push for home rule caused confusion, risking the program’s renewal. The bill is under negotiation as the legislative session nears its end. Eleven people died on city streets that week, underscoring the stakes for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Local power denied.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes’s bill S5602 sought to grant New York City control over its speed and red-light camera programs. The effort failed this session. The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July. Assembly Member William Magnarelli, chair of the Transportation Committee, blamed City Hall for inaction. Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo. Without home rule, New York City’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—face continued risk from political delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
