Mayor Adams and DOT backed home rule, but lawmakers stalled. Senator Gounardes now fights to renew and expand camera programs before they shut off. Vulnerable road users remain exposed. Local power denied.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes’s bill S5602 sought to grant New York City control over its speed and red-light camera programs. The effort failed this session. The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July. Assembly Member William Magnarelli, chair of the Transportation Committee, blamed City Hall for inaction. Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo. Without home rule, New York City’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—face continued risk from political delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He announced a $904 million budget for safety improvements and said, 'We need to find them proactively, and get them off the streets.' Adams called for meetings with precincts and targeting dangerous intersections. But he gave no specifics on enforcement, legislative changes, or expanding the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Advocates like Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) and Sara Lind (Open Plans) welcomed the words but demanded concrete action, especially from the NYPD. The city’s current laws limit its power to remove dangerous drivers. Pending state bills could help, but for now, the mayor’s promise remains just that—words, not protection for those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable lives lost.</p><p class=mb3>On March 25, 2022, Mayor Adams held a press conference on street safety and traffic enforcement policy. The event spotlighted the city’s struggle to control its own traffic laws. Adams slammed state rules that force red light and speed cameras off between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., calling it 'unbelievable.' He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year. The mayor pressed for 24/7 camera operation and renewed NYPD focus.
