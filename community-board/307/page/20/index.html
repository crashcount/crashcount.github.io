A BMW ran the red. Both men died where they fell. The driver fled. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. Since 2018, <strong>drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, brothers, neighbors.</p><h2 id=the-slow-grind-of-policy>The Slow Grind of Policy</h2><p>The city started talking about a fix in 2014. It is now 2025. The plan sits stalled. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>asked, &ldquo;What is going on? There&rsquo;s been no conversation, no updates.&rdquo;</a> State Senator Andrew Gounardes stood at the crash site and <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said, &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Councilmember Alexa Avilés called for real investment, not more studies. The city’s answer was a sign: “Be careful.” Gounardes called it an insult. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway.

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 26, 2024, activists renewed calls for the Department of Transportation to extend the Fourth Avenue redesign into Bay Ridge. The campaign, led by Bike South Brooklyn, the Bay Ridge Environmental Group, and Transportation Alternatives, demands a 'better, safer Fourth Avenue' with a road diet and protected bike lanes. Council Member Justin Brannan, who represents Bay Ridge, has a mixed record—once supportive, now silent as his term ends. State Senator Andrew Gounardes supports the redesign, citing risks to pedestrians and cyclists: 'the design of the street puts your safety at risk.' The DOT has not proposed changes south of Sunset Park, leaving Bay Ridge exposed. Advocates vow to keep fighting for safety, regardless of political will.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Congestion Pricing Opponents Are Blocking Disabled Access to Mass Transit, Politicians Charge,' highlights how legal challenges from New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, the United Federation of Teachers, and others have forced the MTA to halt critical accessibility upgrades. Gounardes declared, 'That’s not gonna happen if the money’s not there.' The MTA earmarked $6 billion for accessibility, aiming to make 70 stations ADA accessible and modernize 78 elevators. Disability advocates like Elizabeth Valdez and Joe Rappaport stressed that most disabled New Yorkers rely on subways and buses, not private cars. Christopher Schuyler noted congestion pricing would speed up paratransit and wheelchair-accessible vehicles.

The incident left a 49-year-old woman in critical condition. The driver, Stanley Manel, was arrested and charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. The officials' statement read: 'We’re deeply saddened and outraged at the news of yet another pedestrian being struck by an unsafe driver in Greenpoint.' Restler and colleagues highlighted the intersection's dangers and the driver's history—35 tickets since 2019, including 26 speed camera violations. They urged support for bills requiring speed control devices for repeat offenders and for Sammy’s Law, which would let NYC set its own speed limits.

The bill, backed by New Yorkers for Transportation Equity, was introduced last year and is under consideration. The measure’s summary promises to 'improve air quality and reduce fatal crashes.' Gounardes, representing Brooklyn’s western edge, champions the shift: 'A new approach will not only protect our climate, but also make New York a safer, more affordable place to live.' Analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute projects 593 fewer traffic deaths each year, with thousands more lives saved through active transportation. The bill’s focus is clear: less driving, more safety, cleaner air, and real savings for families.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates demand less driving, more transit. Highway funds feed car dominance. The law would force state projects to cut vehicle miles. Vulnerable road users stand to gain. Albany stalls. Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>Bill to reduce vehicle miles traveled by 20 percent by 2050, introduced by State Senator Andrew Gounardes (District 26), is backed by advocates and the New Yorkers for Transportation Equity coalition. Announced February 6, 2024, the bill would require transportation officials to align projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes said, "We fundamentally want to be shifting how we think about transportation infrastructure." The measure responds to data showing over 90 percent of infrastructure funds go to roads, not transit. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance called for an "about-face," noting highway projects have torn apart poor communities and endangered pedestrians and cyclists. The bill sits before the state legislature. No direct safety analyst assessment, but advocates stress the law would shift funding from car-centric projects to transit and greenways, reducing systemic danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
