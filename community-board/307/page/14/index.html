A BMW ran the red. Both men died where they fell. The driver fled. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. Since 2018, <strong>drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, brothers, neighbors.</p><h2 id=the-slow-grind-of-policy>The Slow Grind of Policy</h2><p>The city started talking about a fix in 2014. It is now 2025. The plan sits stalled. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>asked, &ldquo;What is going on? There&rsquo;s been no conversation, no updates.&rdquo;</a> State Senator Andrew Gounardes stood at the crash site and <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said, &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Councilmember Alexa Avilés called for real investment, not more studies. The city’s answer was a sign: “Be careful.” Gounardes called it an insult. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway.

The funding, praised by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Mayor Eric Adams, aims to 'revitalize the Brooklyn Marine Terminal,' reduce truck traffic, and modernize infrastructure. The NYC Economic Development Corporation took over BMT from the Port Authority in May. U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler warned the deal could increase truck traffic and threaten jobs, but stressed the port's importance. The grant targets repairs, modernization, and traffic reduction. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided. The project’s impact on street safety remains unclear as freight and trucks shift through Red Hook.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver fled. Paramedics rushed Reina-Gaon to the hospital. He died. Police set up a checkpoint. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes had raised safety concerns at this spot days before.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2024, a fatal hit-and-run occurred in Council District 26. Segundo Reina-Gaon, 74, was killed crossing Ridge Blvd. near Bay Ridge Ave. The incident happened just a block from where State Senator Andrew Gounardes met with Department of Transportation officials to discuss safety issues earlier that week. Gounardes responded, 'Devastated to wake up to the news that a Bay Ridge neighbor was killed by an SUV in a hit-and-run last night. Just two days ago I was discussing safety concerns one block from here with DOT.' The NYPD set up a checkpoint at the crash site, stopping vehicles and checking IDs. The matter underscores the deadly risk to pedestrians and the urgent need for systemic change. Gounardes supports pedestrian safety improvements and enforcement against hit-and-run drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
