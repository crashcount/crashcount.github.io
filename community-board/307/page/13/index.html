The Gowanus. These are the blocks where people don’t make it home.</p><p>Since 2022, at least <strong>15 people have been killed</strong> and 2,407 injured on Brooklyn CB7 streets, with 21 seriously hurt, according to city data covering Jan. 2022–Aug. 25, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Pedestrians account for seven of those dead (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On 3rd Avenue at 52nd Street, a 2011 BMW went straight through the red, police data say. Two men, ages 59 and 80, were crossing with the signal. Both were killed. Contributing factors listed: “Traffic Control Disregarded” and “Unsafe Speed” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4826750</a>).</p><p>A few blocks away, a 30‑year‑old pedestrian died on 4th Avenue near 60th Street after a truck going straight struck him. Listed as “apparent death.” The body injury field says “Head.” The truck showed “No Damage” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4771639</a>).</p><p>A 70‑year‑old woman died at 7th Ave and 44th St. The car was making a left. The line in the record reads “Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.” She was crossing with the signal (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4785620</a>).</p><p>Strong machines. Soft bodies. The ledger stays red.</p><h3 id=where-the-road-bites>Where the road bites</h3><p>The worst sites are named in the city’s files: <strong>4th Avenue</strong> leads with five deaths and 230 injuries. The <strong>Gowanus Expressway</strong> corridor shows two deaths and 343 injuries. <strong>3rd Avenue</strong> shows one death and 155 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data top locations</a>).</p><p>Crashes stack up through the afternoon. Deaths peak at 4 p.m. and 3 p.m., with another spike at 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. Injuries climb from school let‑out to the rush. The hour with the most injuries here is 5 p.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>Listed causes tell the same story: “other” leads, but the killers we know by name show up again—“Failure to Yield,” “Disregarded Traffic Control,” “Unsafe Speed,” “Inattention/Distraction.” Together they cut people down (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data contributing factors</a>).</p><h3 id=two-dead-at-52nd-street>Two dead at 52nd Street</h3><p>The BMW’s front right hit. Two men in the crosswalk went down. Both records say “Crossing With Signal.” Both say “Apparent Death.” The car kept going, per subsequent press coverage of the broader 3rd Avenue carnage that week. At a rally days later, State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said, “Here we are, once again gathering to mourn another preventable tragedy on our streets. But it doesn’t have to be this way” (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/sunset-park-urges-city-to-fast-track-third-avenue-street-fixes-10986450>BKReader</a>).</p><p>DOT’s plan for Third Avenue has been stuck for two years, advocates said at that event. Council Member Alexa Avilés called the corridor “persistently dangerous,” and residents demanded action (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/sunset-park-urges-city-to-fast-track-third-avenue-street-fixes-10986450>BKReader</a>).</p><h3 id=heavy-steel-late-light>Heavy steel, late light</h3><p>Trucks and buses are a small slice of pedestrian injury counts here, but they still kill. One pedestrian death is linked to a truck; sedans and SUVs account for most pedestrian injuries and five pedestrian deaths in the rollup (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data vehicle rollup</a>).</p><p>Night brings a different kind of hit. Deaths rise around 2–4 a.m. The files don’t say why. They don’t need to. The numbers are enough (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data hourly distribution</a>).</p><h3 id=what-to-fix-at-the-worst-corners>What to fix at the worst corners</h3><p>Start with the killers we can touch:</p><ul><li>Harden left turns and give leading pedestrian intervals on 7th Ave at 44th St. The record says “Failure to Yield.” Fix the turn.</li><li>Daylight and protect crossings on 3rd Ave at 52nd St. Two dead, signal obeyed, driver ran the red. Clear sightlines and raised crossings force lower speeds.</li><li>Truck‑calming and routing on 4th Ave near 60th St and along the Gowanus frontage. One pedestrian dead under a box truck’s path; 4th Ave shows the worst toll. Slow the freight where people walk.</li></ul><p>These are standard tools. They work when installed. The files in this district name the places.</p><h3 id=the-laws-that-move-the-needle>The laws that move the needle</h3><p>Albany renewed New York City’s 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. The Governor’s office and the bill’s sponsor said cameras cut dangerous driving. City data show big drops at camera sites (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog</a>; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>).</p><p>Lawmakers also advanced a bill to force <strong>intelligent speed assistance</strong> on repeat violators. Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored S 4045 and voted it through committee; Senator Steve Chan also voted yes (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a>). The target is drivers who stack violations. The aim is simple: cap their speed.</p><p>The city now has the power to set safer speeds under Sammy’s Law, and advocates are pushing a <strong>20 mph default</strong>. The case is blunt: <strong>speed kills</strong>. The call to act is here (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount Take Action</a>).</p><p>Brooklyn CB7’s ledger is public. The bodies fall on 4th Avenue, 3rd Avenue, and under the Gowanus. The names sit in cells and rows. The crossings wait.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
