Since 2022, <strong>13 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,148 have been injured</strong> in crashes. Twenty of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a blink, families left with empty chairs and hospital bills. In the last year alone, <strong>2 people died</strong> and <strong>664 were hurt</strong>. The dead are not numbers. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, struck by a turning sedan on 7th Avenue. A 30-year-old man, crushed by a truck on 60th Street. A 49-year-old cyclist, thrown and killed by a pickup at 53rd and 4th. The street is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed first.</strong> Trucks, sedans, SUVs—they do the killing. In the last three years, cars and trucks took 5 lives, motorcycles and mopeds 1, bikes none. The rest are left with broken bones, crushed limbs, and memories that do not heal. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in CB7, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city says, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> The words are right. The action is not enough. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it here. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is another risk, another family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras, more street redesigns, more action.

The piece, titled 'Mega-distribution facilities cluster in our neighborhoods. Let’s fix that with City of Yes,' highlights the unchecked spread of last-mile distribution centers. Avilés argues these facilities, allowed 'as-of-right' in manufacturing zones, bring traffic, pollution, and safety hazards to vulnerable communities. She writes, 'COYEO can ensure that last-mile facilities don't remain unchecked by requiring special permits...contingent on rigorous assessments of their impact on traffic, safety, and the environment.' Avilés calls for community input and accountability from developers. The op-ed urges the Council’s Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee to strengthen COYEO, demanding action to protect streets, sidewalks, and the people who use them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure remains in committee. The bill responds to a fatal flaw: 'We have no mechanism right now, under law, to crack down on extremely reckless drivers,' said Brooklyn State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The current law lets drivers rack up dozens of camera tickets and keep driving, since no points are added to licenses. Gianaris’s bill aims to close this loophole. DOT and crash victims’ families, including Juliane Williams, whose daughter was killed by a speeding driver, press for stronger penalties and expansion of the red light camera program. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired with little effect.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that the department of transportation repair broken curbs as part of resurfacing projects,' demands DOT fix hazardous curbs during any resurfacing work. Council Members Schulman, Gennaro (primary sponsor), Gutiérrez, Louis, Brewer, and Avilés back the measure. The bill aims to close a deadly gap: broken curbs force pedestrians, wheelchair users, and parents with strollers into traffic. The law would take effect 120 days after passage.

The matter, described as a move to 'loosen vehicle idling regulations around schools,' would let drivers idle engines by narrowing the definition of 'adjacent'—allowing them to move just down the block or across the street to evade the one-minute rule. Council Member Alexa Avilés, who sponsored a bill to expand these protections, condemned DEP’s plan, stating it 'flies in the face' of efforts to protect children, especially those with asthma. Every public speaker opposed the change. Ernest Welde accused DEP of misleading the public, calling them the 'Department of Enabling Polluters.' DEP said it would consider feedback before finalizing the rule.
