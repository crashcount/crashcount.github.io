Two men in the crosswalk went down. Both records say “Crossing With Signal.” Both say “Apparent Death.” The car kept going, per subsequent press coverage of the broader 3rd Avenue carnage that week.

"This means no new station elevators for elderly and disabled riders, and no new subway signals to speed up commutes for working New Yorkers."" -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration withdrew federal approval for New York City's congestion pricing program. U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy cited burdens on working-class drivers and questioned the legality of using toll revenue for transit. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit to challenge the move, arguing the program is settled law and already reduces congestion. State Senators Andrew Gounardes and Zellnor Myrie condemned the action, warning, 'Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system.' The withdrawal aligns with New Jersey's opposition and threatens transit upgrades like elevators for elderly and disabled riders.

The program, covering 750 school zones, needs state approval before June. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls speed cameras 'one of the most effective tools' to stop deadly driving. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who sponsored the last reauthorization, says, 'my bill to expand the speed camera program has saved lives.' The city wants stronger penalties for repeat offenders and action on license plate fraud, which lets millions of violations go unpunished. The report shows cameras cut speeding by 94 percent and reduce injuries and deaths. The program faces political hurdles, but the evidence is clear: speed cameras protect people on foot and bike.
