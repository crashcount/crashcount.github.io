Since 2022, <strong>13 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,148 have been injured</strong> in crashes. Twenty of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a blink, families left with empty chairs and hospital bills. In the last year alone, <strong>2 people died</strong> and <strong>664 were hurt</strong>. The dead are not numbers. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, struck by a turning sedan on 7th Avenue. A 30-year-old man, crushed by a truck on 60th Street. A 49-year-old cyclist, thrown and killed by a pickup at 53rd and 4th. The street is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed first.</strong> Trucks, sedans, SUVs—they do the killing. In the last three years, cars and trucks took 5 lives, motorcycles and mopeds 1, bikes none. The rest are left with broken bones, crushed limbs, and memories that do not heal. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in CB7, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city says, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> The words are right. The action is not enough. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it here. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is another risk, another family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras, more street redesigns, more action. Do not wait for another obituary.</p><p><strong>The street will not change itself. You have to make it happen.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The moped driver, a 36-year-old male wearing a helmet, was partially ejected during the collision with a sedan. The report cites 'Driver Inexperience' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors. The moped's left front bumper struck the sedan, resulting in the driver sustaining a fractured and dislocated elbow and lower arm injury classified as severity level 3. The sedan had no occupants at the time. This incident highlights the dangers posed by driver errors such as inexperience and unsafe following distance, which directly contributed to the violent impact and serious injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.

The funding, praised by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Mayor Eric Adams, aims to 'revitalize the Brooklyn Marine Terminal,' reduce truck traffic, and modernize infrastructure. The NYC Economic Development Corporation took over BMT from the Port Authority in May. U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler warned the deal could increase truck traffic and threaten jobs, but stressed the port's importance. The grant targets repairs, modernization, and traffic reduction. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided. The project’s impact on street safety remains unclear as freight and trucks shift through Red Hook.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
