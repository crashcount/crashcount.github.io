Since 2022, <strong>13 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,148 have been injured</strong> in crashes. Twenty of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a blink, families left with empty chairs and hospital bills. In the last year alone, <strong>2 people died</strong> and <strong>664 were hurt</strong>. The dead are not numbers. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, struck by a turning sedan on 7th Avenue. A 30-year-old man, crushed by a truck on 60th Street. A 49-year-old cyclist, thrown and killed by a pickup at 53rd and 4th. The street is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed first.</strong> Trucks, sedans, SUVs—they do the killing. In the last three years, cars and trucks took 5 lives, motorcycles and mopeds 1, bikes none. The rest are left with broken bones, crushed limbs, and memories that do not heal. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in CB7, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city says, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> The words are right. The action is not enough. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it here. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is another risk, another family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras, more street redesigns, more action. Do not wait for another obituary.</p><p><strong>The street will not change itself. You have to make it happen.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Gounardes leads the push to penalize repeat offenders who speed past cameras. The bill’s text is blunt: more violations, higher fines.

Introduced January 17, 2025, it awaits committee review. The bill summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, and others. No votes have been recorded yet. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving by forcing speed limiters on offenders.

The crash exposed driver inattention as a critical threat at intersections.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, at 10:30 PM on 55th Street in Brooklyn, a vehicle traveling south struck a pedestrian at the intersection. The pedestrian, a 43-year-old male, was crossing with the signal when the collision occurred. The point of impact was the vehicle's left front bumper, causing abrasions to the pedestrian's face. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a primary contributing factor. The pedestrian's role was noted as 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian at Intersection,' and he was conscious after the crash. While the report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, the critical driver error was distraction. The vehicle was going straight ahead, and the damage was limited to the left front bumper. This incident underscores the persistent danger posed by distracted driving in urban intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
