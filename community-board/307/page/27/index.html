A BMW ran the red. Both men died where they fell. The driver fled. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. Since 2018, <strong>drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, brothers, neighbors.</p><h2 id=the-slow-grind-of-policy>The Slow Grind of Policy</h2><p>The city started talking about a fix in 2014. It is now 2025. The plan sits stalled. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>asked, &ldquo;What is going on? There&rsquo;s been no conversation, no updates.&rdquo;</a> State Senator Andrew Gounardes stood at the crash site and <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said, &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Councilmember Alexa Avilés called for real investment, not more studies. The city’s answer was a sign: “Be careful.” Gounardes called it an insult. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway.

The event was not a council bill but a public response to traffic violence. State Senator Andrew Gounardes, mentioned in the event, spoke of the need for government action to make streets safer, saying, 'There’s work to do on every level of government to make the streets safer.' Mayor Eric Adams emphasized Vision Zero and the need for mental health resources, stating, 'Vision Zero [should be] an actualization as we make our streets safe.' Steve Mei, of the Chinese-American Planning Council, called for more city-funded mental health services, especially for seniors. The vigil underscored the community’s grief and the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.

State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymembers Robert Carroll and Zohran Mamdani also participated, urging Albany to boost state funding and implement congestion pricing.

Critics called the vision incomplete.</p><p class=mb3>""The ROADS Act, as mentioned by Mayor Adams today, could save hundreds of lives each year, and would be crucial in achieving Vision Zero, once and for all. I strongly support any and all efforts to crack down on reckless drivers and to keep our streets safe for all. I look forward to partnering with Mayor Adams to achieve that goal," he said." -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On January 26, 2023, Mayor Adams delivered his State of the City address, outlining new transportation and public space plans. The speech promised a $375-million investment in public spaces, permanent open streets, and a push for zero-emission for-hire vehicles by 2030. Adams also highlighted bills targeting reckless drivers and announced a new Director of the Public Realm. The mayor said, 'We will require the 100,000-plus high-volume for-hire vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2030.' Council Member Andrew Gounardes praised the ROADS Act, saying it 'could save hundreds of lives each year.' But advocates like Open Plans and Betsy Plum criticized the lack of action on transit equity, parking reform, and access for low-income New Yorkers. The address left out bus lane expansion, Fair Fares growth, and city fleet reduction, drawing fire for missing bold, systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
