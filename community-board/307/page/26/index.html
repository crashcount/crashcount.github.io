A BMW ran the red. Both men died where they fell. The driver fled. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. Since 2018, <strong>drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, brothers, neighbors.</p><h2 id=the-slow-grind-of-policy>The Slow Grind of Policy</h2><p>The city started talking about a fix in 2014. It is now 2025. The plan sits stalled. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>asked, &ldquo;What is going on? There&rsquo;s been no conversation, no updates.&rdquo;</a> State Senator Andrew Gounardes stood at the crash site and <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said, &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Councilmember Alexa Avilés called for real investment, not more studies. The city’s answer was a sign: “Be careful.” Gounardes called it an insult. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway.

At a rally, Restler said, "It is wrong how deadly this strip is." The officials demand mid-block crossings, daylighted intersections, raised crosswalks, curb extensions, and safer pedestrian space near BQE ramps. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized city resistance to reallocating street space, saying, "They drag their feet because they don’t want to do the inevitable." The Department of Transportation has agreed only to study new crosswalks. The bill is not yet formal legislation but marks a push for action after years of delay.

The Council now holds the power. Lawmakers stall. Streets stay deadly. Victims’ families and advocates demand action. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, named for 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, would let New York City lower speed limits below 25 mph. The bill failed to enter the 2023 state budget, shifting responsibility to the City Council. In 2021, the Council backed a home rule message 42-6, but the Assembly blocked it. Last year, the Council reversed course and failed to pass the message. This session, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, with 10 sponsors. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers must hold a hearing before a vote. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Brooks-Powers have not signed on, citing negotiations. The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.' Data show slower speeds save lives. Advocates and victims’ families keep pushing. The Council’s inaction keeps streets dangerous.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The old system kept streets dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Bill S1234, introduced by Senator Andrew Gounardes on April 12, 2023, aims to overhaul New York’s environmental review process. The bill, now before the legislature, would replace the outdated 'level of service' metric—focused on driver delay—with a mandate to reduce total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by 15 percent by 2050. The bill summary states: 'By eliminating the relevance of level of service as a metric and utilizing vehicle miles traveled reduction instead, we can provide a new criteria for determining the significance of transportation impacts.' Gounardes, the bill’s sponsor, argues this shift will cut emissions and promote safer, multimodal streets. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Sara Lind back the measure, calling it a long-overdue update that could finally let safety and climate take priority over car traffic. The bill follows California’s lead and could set a national example.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The money would fund city infrastructure. Trucks crowd streets. Packages pile up. The bill aims to slow the flood. City Hall will review. Delivery giants face new rules. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill on March 23, 2023, proposing a 25-cent surcharge on every online delivery package in New York City. The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
