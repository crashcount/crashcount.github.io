Since 2022, <strong>13 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,148 have been injured</strong> in crashes. Twenty of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a blink, families left with empty chairs and hospital bills. In the last year alone, <strong>2 people died</strong> and <strong>664 were hurt</strong>. The dead are not numbers. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, struck by a turning sedan on 7th Avenue. A 30-year-old man, crushed by a truck on 60th Street. A 49-year-old cyclist, thrown and killed by a pickup at 53rd and 4th. The street is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed first.</strong> Trucks, sedans, SUVs—they do the killing. In the last three years, cars and trucks took 5 lives, motorcycles and mopeds 1, bikes none. The rest are left with broken bones, crushed limbs, and memories that do not heal. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in CB7, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city says, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> The words are right. The action is not enough. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it here. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is another risk, another family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras, more street redesigns, more action.

Trucks choke Red Hook and Sunset Park. Narrow streets shake. Residents breathe fumes. The bill demands safer, smarter routes. Data and daylighting aim to protect people, not just freight.</p><p class=mb3>On September 30, 2022, Council Member Alexa Avilés (District 38) introduced a package of bills targeting last-mile trucking regulation. The measures, revived in committee, seek to redesign truck routes and gather data on facilities run by Amazon, FedEx, and UPS. The matter aims to 'reduce congestion and emissions, improve safety and increase visibility,' especially in overburdened neighborhoods like Red Hook and Sunset Park. Avilés, the lead sponsor, calls for systematic changes: 'We really need to look systematically at more improved routes to ensure people are safe.' The bills would require the Department of Transportation to daylight intersections and the Department of Environmental Protection to install air monitors on heavy-use roads. Councilwoman Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsors a related bill for public truck-route data. The legislation draws support from industry and advocates, all seeking safer streets and cleaner air for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No comment yet.</p><p class=mb3>On September 16, 2022, Council Member Alexa Avilés challenged NYCHA’s proposed blanket ban on e-bikes across public housing. In a letter to NYCHA CEO Greg Russ, Avilés urged targeted battery safety rules instead of a broad ban, warning, 'NYCHA's all-out ban could hurt workers and residents more.' She offered eight recommendations, including federal study, safe battery storage, and clear rules for mobility devices. Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz announced plans for legislation requiring certified batteries, while Manhattan’s Gale Brewer is drafting a ban on second-hand batteries and pushing for delivery app accountability. The matter is under review after the comment period closed September 6. NYCHA declined to comment. Avilés’s stance centers on protecting delivery workers and vulnerable residents while addressing real fire risks from faulty batteries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, not yet in committee, would require a special permit for new warehouses. The proposal states: 'new last-mile warehouses must be at least 1,000 feet from schools, parks, nursing homes, public housing, and other such facilities.' It also pushes for 80% of deliveries in maritime areas to use marine transport, and encourages deliveries by foot, bike, and rail. Aviles and advocates demand a full land-use review (ULURP) for new sites. Existing warehouses are exempt. Kevin Garcia, an advocate, said, 'We want to reduce the number of cars and trucks that are leaving the facility.' The plan aims to cut truck traffic and emissions, which endanger vulnerable road users in low-income neighborhoods.

In the first three weeks, cameras issued 513,777 tickets—70 percent more than before. The bill, championed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, removed harsher penalties but kept round-the-clock enforcement. The matter summary states, 'speed safety cameras are working as they should—catching more speeding drivers and combatting reckless driving.' Council members and advocates, including Elizabeth Adams and Jehiah Czebotar, backed the move. They point to data showing most extra tickets came at night and weekends, exposing a hidden threat to pedestrians and cyclists. Officials insist the expansion will save lives and curb reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearings drew nearly a thousand speakers. The plan, described as aiming to 'reduce congestion, air pollution, and driving into the city,' would charge drivers $5 to $23 depending on time and exemptions. Council Member Robert Carroll (District 44) urged, 'It needs to be implemented now, we passed this bill three years ago, it’s time to get moving.' Other lawmakers, including Andrew Gounardes and Mark Levine, debated exemptions and credits.
