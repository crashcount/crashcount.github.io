A BMW ran the red. Both men died where they fell. The driver fled. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. Since 2018, <strong>drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, brothers, neighbors.</p><h2 id=the-slow-grind-of-policy>The Slow Grind of Policy</h2><p>The city started talking about a fix in 2014. It is now 2025. The plan sits stalled. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>asked, &ldquo;What is going on? There&rsquo;s been no conversation, no updates.&rdquo;</a> State Senator Andrew Gounardes stood at the crash site and <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said, &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Councilmember Alexa Avilés called for real investment, not more studies. The city’s answer was a sign: “Be careful.” Gounardes called it an insult. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway.

Kevin Parker. The group backed Kaegan Mays-Williams, citing her support for redesigning Brooklyn's bus network and expanding protected bike lanes. StreetsPAC Executive Director Eric McClure said, 'She supports redesigning Brooklyn's bus network to simplify routes and speed commutes.' Parker did not respond to StreetsPAC's request for information and has a record of negative incidents. Mays-Williams stressed the need for dependable public transit and safer cycling. StreetsPAC also highlighted the safety records of Andrew Gounardes, Angel Vasquez, Jabori Brisport, Rajiv Gowda, Christian Amato, and Kristen Gonzalez, noting their support for speed cameras, pedestrian and bicycle safety, and transit improvements. The endorsement signals a clear push for candidates who prioritize vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law ends the blackout. No more breaks for speeders. State Senator Andrew Gounardes led the charge. The city’s streets stay watched. Vulnerable lives get a fighting chance.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2022, a new law took effect expanding New York City’s speed camera program to operate 24/7. The bill, sponsored in the State Senate by Andrew Gounardes, passed in Albany and was signed by Governor Hochul in June. The measure extends the program for three years and ends the old rule that shut cameras off overnight and on weekends. The Department of Transportation has installed about 2,000 cameras in 750 school zones. The bill’s summary: 'expands the safety technology around the clock.' Gounardes said, 'Your right to speed does not supersede anyone’s rights to live on the streets safely.' Mayor Eric Adams joined advocates to celebrate, stating, 'A city that never sleeps deserves a camera system that won’t take a nap.' DOT data shows 59% of traffic deaths happened during off hours. The expansion aims to close that deadly gap.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection, despite a history of crashes, has not been redesigned. No charges were filed against the driver, even though evidence suggested a failure to yield. Days earlier, Monica Chen, a pedestrian, was killed by a turning driver in Bay Ridge. Again, no charges. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and City Council Member Justin Brannan expressed outrage, stating, "We are both outraged that the epidemic of traffic violence continues and as a result, a 67 year old woman is dead." They pledged to press the Department of Transportation for more safety measures. The NYPD declined comment. The Bronx faces a surge in road deaths. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, championed by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, requires pre-licensing courses and written exams to include instruction on the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians. The bill's summary states it aims to 'educate drivers about the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians and will create a thoughtful road culture going forward.' Gounardes sponsored the bill, which takes effect in January. Until now, the driver's manual offered only a single page on sharing the road. The law directs the state to consult law enforcement, advocates, and medical experts to shape the curriculum.

The bill, led by Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, updates the five-hour pre-licensing course and driver's manual. The matter summary states: 'The law addresses a longstanding gap in driver education, which had previously left generations of motorists with little awareness of road-sharing with pedestrians and cyclists.' Gov. Hochul said, 'It is common sense to make pedestrian and bike safety education mandatory for drivers.' Gounardes noted that driver instruction had not kept pace with the growing presence of cyclists and micro-mobility users. In 2021, driver inexperience contributed to over 2,500 injury crashes in NYC.
