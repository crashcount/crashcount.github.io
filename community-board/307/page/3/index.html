Twenty left with serious injuries.</strong> Over three years, the streets have not grown gentler. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors: a 70-year-old woman struck crossing with the light, a 49-year-old cyclist crushed by a turning truck, an 82-year-old man killed by a motorcycle. Each loss is final. Each wound is deep.</p><p><strong>In the last year alone:</strong> two more lives ended. Five more left with injuries that will not heal. <strong>659 people hurt.</strong> The pain is not spread evenly. The old and the young, the ones on foot or on bikes, take the brunt. The drivers keep driving. The city keeps counting.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-change>Patterns That Do Not Change</h3><p>The killers have names: <strong>cars, trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes</strong>. Cars and trucks did the most damage—<strong>three deaths, five serious injuries</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, left three more with broken bodies. Even bikes are not blameless. The street does not care who you are. It only cares who is bigger, who is faster, who is left standing.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speeds, more cameras. But in CB7, the blood keeps flowing. <strong>Crashes are down just 8% from last year. Deaths dropped from five to one, but the cost is still too high.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits now. They have the power to act. Every day they wait, the risk remains. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is not chance.</strong> Streets can be changed. Speeds can be lowered. Cameras can be kept on. But only if people demand it. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand protection for speed cameras.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
