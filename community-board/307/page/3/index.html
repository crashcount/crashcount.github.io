Since 2022, <strong>13 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,148 have been injured</strong> in crashes. Twenty of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a blink, families left with empty chairs and hospital bills. In the last year alone, <strong>2 people died</strong> and <strong>664 were hurt</strong>. The dead are not numbers. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, struck by a turning sedan on 7th Avenue. A 30-year-old man, crushed by a truck on 60th Street. A 49-year-old cyclist, thrown and killed by a pickup at 53rd and 4th. The street is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed first.</strong> Trucks, sedans, SUVs—they do the killing. In the last three years, cars and trucks took 5 lives, motorcycles and mopeds 1, bikes none. The rest are left with broken bones, crushed limbs, and memories that do not heal. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in CB7, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city says, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> The words are right. The action is not enough. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it here. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is another risk, another family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras, more street redesigns, more action. Do not wait for another obituary.</p><p><strong>The street will not change itself. You have to make it happen.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers clash, then unite. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 16, 2025, State Sen. Anthony Palumbo, Republican from Suffolk, changed course on the Stop Super Speeders bill (S4045/A2029). The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes, would require speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more speed-camera violations in a year. Palumbo first called the measure 'government overreach,' preferring license suspensions. After debate and a detailed comparison to ignition locks for drunk drivers, Palumbo agreed to support the bill if it meets its goal. Gounardes explained, 'We mimicked the ignition lock process and procedure.' The bill gained momentum after a deadly crash. According to the safety analyst, the event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so no safety impact can be determined.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, “An elderly man was mowed down and killed by a hit-and-run driver in Brooklyn on May 10, just seconds after the same driver smashed into a nearby vehicle.” The driver first collided with a 2023 Chevrolet Malibu, then continued on and struck Maxwell near Sutter Ave. and Osborn St. The Malibu’s occupants were uninjured and remained at the scene. The driver who killed Maxwell fled and remains unidentified. The NYPD Highway District collision investigation squad is investigating. No arrests have been made.

Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked.

Advocates warn: this policy endangers lives and livelihoods.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, the NYPD announced a shift: cyclists, especially delivery workers, now face criminal court summonses for minor traffic violations. The department claims it is responding to e-bike complaints, but has offered no data. Council Member Alexa Avilés (D-Sunset Park) condemned the policy, saying, 'contact with the NYPD is a premise for the deportation pipeline.' She accused Mayor Adams of political maneuvering and failing to address street safety equitably. Lawyers warn that criminal charges can derail immigration cases, exposing workers to ICE. App companies like Uber Eats oppose criminalization, while GrubHub urges legal compliance. Transportation Alternatives launched a petition against the crackdown. The Adams administration also leaked a draft bill to regulate delivery apps, but it has stalled. The new enforcement targets the city’s most vulnerable road users—immigrant cyclists—putting their safety and futures at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler leads, joined by Salaam, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Banks, and Brannan. The bill would force drivers with eleven or more points in eighteen months, or six speed/red light camera tickets in a year, to install speed-limiting tech. The Council cites data: 265 killed, 52,949 injured on city streets in 2023. The measure aims to put a brake on reckless driving. The committee has not yet advanced the resolution.
