A BMW came fast. It did not stop. The car hit them. Both men died in the street. The driver ran. Police later arrested him and charged him with manslaughter and leaving the scene. The men were named Kex Un Chen and Faqiu Lin. They were walking to a food pantry. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-men-crossing-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very heartbroken. He was a good person,&rdquo; said Lin&rsquo;s sister.</a></p><p>This was not the first time. It will not be the last. In the last 12 months, <strong>2 people died and 706 were injured</strong> in traffic crashes in Brooklyn CB7. Six were seriously hurt. The dead are mostly on foot or bike. The numbers do not stop. CBS New York <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-killed-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run/>reported</a> the car &ldquo;drove through a Brooklyn intersection, hitting and killing them as they crossed the street.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-corridor-of-broken-promises>The Corridor of Broken Promises</h3><p>Third Avenue is wide. It is fast. It is deadly. The city had a plan to fix it. The plan would have narrowed lanes and added protection. The community board supported it. The city paused the plan after business owners complained. Since then, 96 crashes have injured 80 people. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-pedestrians-on-third-ave-corridor-eric-adams-refuses-to-make-safer>&ldquo;It was only a matter of time before somebody else died on this corridor and here we are,&rdquo; said Julio Peña.</a></p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Alexa Avilés co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and to legalize crossing mid-block, ending jaywalking tickets. These are steps forward. But the city has not finished the job. The mayor and DOT have the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it. The redesign for Third Avenue is still on hold. The dead wait for action.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-do-not-lie>The Numbers That Do Not Lie</h3><p>Since 2022, <strong>13 people have died and 2,243 have been injured</strong> in traffic crashes in Brooklyn CB7. Cars and trucks killed or hurt 212 people on foot. Motorcycles and mopeds, 15. Bikes, 32. The toll is steady. The pain is not spread evenly. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city finish the job. Lower the speed limit. Build the safety projects.

Streets remain perilous for walkers and riders until the law takes hold.</p><p class=mb3>On May 21, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee advanced bill S4045B, known as the Stop Super Speeders bill. The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes, aims to curb reckless driving. Initially, Sen. Anthony Palumbo (R-Suffolk) opposed the measure, citing concerns about government overreach and enforcement. He compared it to ignition locks for drunk drivers, which he supports. After discussion with Gounardes, Palumbo shifted, supporting the bill if it meets its goal. The bill’s summary states it targets repeat speeders with court orders and misdemeanor charges for non-compliance. Data shows 21 percent of fatal pedestrian crashes in NYC involve vehicles with six or more camera tickets in the prior year. Speed limiters have been shown to reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent.

Cyclists keep dying.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee considered S533, a bill to repeal congestion pricing, after a procedural motion by Sen. Jack Martins. Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets. Cyclist deaths keep rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
