Two men stepped into the crosswalk at 52nd Street and Third Avenue. A BMW ran the red. The car did not slow. Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were hit and left in the street. Both died where they fell. The driver sped away. Police caught him later. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>told police</a>.</p><p>The men were trying to reach a food pantry. &ldquo;We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of two individuals in Sunset Park this morning. Our thoughts are with their families and loved ones. We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said City Harvest</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last 12 months, Brooklyn CB7 saw 2 killed, 6 seriously hurt, and over 700 injured in 1,031 crashes. In the first half of 2025, 1 person is dead, 4 are seriously hurt, and 420 are injured. The dead are mostly people on foot or bike. The old, the young, the ones with nowhere else to go.</p><h2 id=the-same-streets-the-same-danger>The Same Streets, The Same Danger</h2><p>Neighbors say drivers speed on that stretch. The city’s own data shows 59 crashes and 80 injuries in three blocks around the site in five years. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>reported CBS New York</a>. The blood dries, but the danger stays.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h2><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Council Member Alexa Avilés co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. Senator Andrew Gounardes voted to renew speed cameras and backed the Stop Super Speeders Act. Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes voted yes to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored a bill for speed limiters. But the citywide speed limit is still above 20 mph. Enforcement is slow. Cameras catch speeders, but repeat offenders keep driving. The laws are not enough. The dead keep coming.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets where the old and the hungry can cross and live. Do not wait for the next body in the road.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The push comes ahead of the next budget cycle. Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Amanda Septimo, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher led the call. Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warned that cuts or fare hikes would devastate working- and middle-class New Yorkers.

The request follows complaints after Schermerhorn Street’s redesign, which added a protected bike lane but made all crossings one-way southbound, causing gridlock and blocking access for services. The Community Board’s Transportation and Public Safety Committee, chaired by Sid Meyer, voted to support the change and insisted DOT maintain and protect the Bond Street bike lane with a physical barrier. Restler said, 'We believe that this proposal will improve traffic flow and enhance the public’s access to essential services, deliveries, and residences.' DOT is reviewing the proposal. The matter centers on the impact of traffic changes on residents and the need to safeguard vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They are wide, fast, and deadly for walkers and cyclists. Most are state-owned. Cities and advocates demand lower speeds, urban design, and local control. Changing these streets is urgent. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy statement, published October 18, 2022, by Streetsblog NYC, highlights the urgent need to fix deadly arterial roads. The statement, titled 'Vision Zero Cities: How to Fix Our Most Dangerous Roads,' calls for context-sensitive speed limits, urban street design standards, and transferring state-owned roads to city control. Streetsblog and Transportation Alternatives urge, 'Cities and advocates should push their states to transform arterial streets into safe spaces for all modes.' The statement notes that arterials make up 15 percent of roads but see 67 percent of pedestrian deaths. It stresses that speed is the main factor in fatal crashes and that state DOTs often prioritize fast driving over safety. The call is clear: redesign streets for people, not cars, and give cities the power to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a 'complete transformation of the look and feel of the corridor,' converted Schermerhorn from a chaotic two-way street to a one-way with parking-protected bike lanes. Restler, who once failed to ride the stretch without leaving the lane due to illegal parking, called the redesign 'real safety in downtown Brooklyn.'
