A BMW ran the red. Both men died where they fell. The driver fled. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. Since 2018, <strong>drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, brothers, neighbors.</p><h2 id=the-slow-grind-of-policy>The Slow Grind of Policy</h2><p>The city started talking about a fix in 2014. It is now 2025. The plan sits stalled. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>asked, &ldquo;What is going on? There&rsquo;s been no conversation, no updates.&rdquo;</a> State Senator Andrew Gounardes stood at the crash site and <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said, &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Councilmember Alexa Avilés called for real investment, not more studies. The city’s answer was a sign: “Be careful.” Gounardes called it an insult. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway.

They are wide, fast, and deadly for walkers and cyclists. Most are state-owned. Cities and advocates demand lower speeds, urban design, and local control. Changing these streets is urgent. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy statement, published October 18, 2022, by Streetsblog NYC, highlights the urgent need to fix deadly arterial roads. The statement, titled 'Vision Zero Cities: How to Fix Our Most Dangerous Roads,' calls for context-sensitive speed limits, urban street design standards, and transferring state-owned roads to city control. Streetsblog and Transportation Alternatives urge, 'Cities and advocates should push their states to transform arterial streets into safe spaces for all modes.' The statement notes that arterials make up 15 percent of roads but see 67 percent of pedestrian deaths. It stresses that speed is the main factor in fatal crashes and that state DOTs often prioritize fast driving over safety. The call is clear: redesign streets for people, not cars, and give cities the power to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists now ride behind parked cars, shielded from traffic. Councilmember Lincoln Restler pushed for the overhaul after years of crashes and blocked lanes. Safety comes first.</p><p class=mb3>On October 12, 2022, the Department of Transportation opened a fortified, two-way protected bike lane on Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn’s District 33. The project, championed by Councilmember Lincoln Restler, followed years of complaints about blocked, unprotected lanes and frequent crashes. The matter, described as a 'complete transformation of the look and feel of the corridor,' converted Schermerhorn from a chaotic two-way street to a one-way with parking-protected bike lanes. Restler, who once failed to ride the stretch without leaving the lane due to illegal parking, called the redesign 'real safety in downtown Brooklyn.' DOT data shows 29 cyclists injured and one killed on this stretch since 2012. The overhaul separates cyclists from moving vehicles, reducing risk for Brooklyn’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists now ride behind parked cars, shielded from traffic. The old, chaotic street saw 29 cyclist injuries and one death. Councilmember Restler pushed for this change.</p><p class=mb3>On October 12, 2022, the Department of Transportation held a ribbon-cutting for the new protected bike lane on Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn's District 33. The overhaul converted the street to one-way eastbound and installed a two-way, parking-protected bike lane. The matter summary reads: 'DOT cuts ribbon on newly fortified Schermerhorn Street bike lane.' Councilmember Lincoln Restler, who championed the redesign, attended the event and called it 'a great friggin day for Brooklyn.' The old lanes were unprotected and blocked by double-parked cars, forcing cyclists into traffic. Since 2012, 29 cyclists have been injured and one killed along this stretch. The new design separates cyclists from vehicles, aiming to end the danger that plagued this busy corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would block massive facilities near homes, schools, and parks. It demands public review and stricter permits. The aim: less truck traffic, cleaner air, safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>On September 8, 2022, Councilmember Alexa Avilés (District 38) supported a proposal to tighten zoning and permitting for e-commerce warehouses in New York City. The measure, not yet introduced as a formal bill, seeks to amend city zoning rules to require special permits for warehouses over 50,000 square feet and ban them within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, nursing homes, public housing, or other warehouses. The proposal states: 'The facilities won’t negatively impact nearby traffic, pedestrian and road safety, or air pollution.' Avilés, along with Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes, backs the effort, citing frequent community complaints about truck traffic and pollution. The plan mandates environmental review and public input before any City Council vote. Community groups and environmental advocates say the change is urgent for neighborhoods already burdened by traffic and pollution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine backed toll credits for tunnel users and taxi exemptions. Taxi and for-hire drivers lobbied for relief, citing existing surcharges.
