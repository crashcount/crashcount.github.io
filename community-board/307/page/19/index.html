Since 2022, <strong>13 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,148 have been injured</strong> in crashes. Twenty of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a blink, families left with empty chairs and hospital bills. In the last year alone, <strong>2 people died</strong> and <strong>664 were hurt</strong>. The dead are not numbers. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, struck by a turning sedan on 7th Avenue. A 30-year-old man, crushed by a truck on 60th Street. A 49-year-old cyclist, thrown and killed by a pickup at 53rd and 4th. The street is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed first.</strong> Trucks, sedans, SUVs—they do the killing. In the last three years, cars and trucks took 5 lives, motorcycles and mopeds 1, bikes none. The rest are left with broken bones, crushed limbs, and memories that do not heal. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in CB7, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city says, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> The words are right. The action is not enough. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it here. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is another risk, another family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras, more street redesigns, more action.

The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, targets drivers with six or more automated speed or red light tickets, or eleven license points in 18 months. The measure would force these drivers to install devices that cap speed at five miles per hour above the limit. Gounardes said, 'There is a persistent cohort of drivers... driving on our streets recklessly without any consequences.' The bill was unveiled at the site of a fatal pedestrian crash in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which mandates safety courses for repeat offenders, has faced criticism for weak enforcement.
