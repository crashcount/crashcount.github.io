Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>Bill to reduce vehicle miles traveled by 20 percent by 2050, introduced by State Senator Andrew Gounardes (District 26), is backed by advocates and the New Yorkers for Transportation Equity coalition. Announced February 6, 2024, the bill would require transportation officials to align projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes said, "We fundamentally want to be shifting how we think about transportation infrastructure." The measure responds to data showing over 90 percent of infrastructure funds go to roads, not transit. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance called for an "about-face," noting highway projects have torn apart poor communities and endangered pedestrians and cyclists. The bill sits before the state legislature. No direct safety analyst assessment, but advocates stress the law would shift funding from car-centric projects to transit and greenways, reducing systemic danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes pushes a bill to slash car trips by a fifth by 2050. Advocates say New York spends billions on roads while traffic deaths climb. The law would force highway projects to prove they cut driving, not fuel it.</p><p class=mb3>State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill requiring New York to reduce vehicle miles traveled by 20 percent by 2050. The bill, modeled after Minnesota law, is not yet passed or assigned to a committee. It would amend the state’s climate law, forcing transportation officials to align highway projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes warns, 'If we’re just going to use that money to double down on the transportation of the past, on just purely automobile usage, we’re making a great mistake.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit. The measure would require revisions or offsets for projects that don’t cut driving. Gov. Hochul’s office declined comment. The bill aims to halt the cycle of road expansion, rising traffic, and mounting deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action.

The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.'

Warehouses choke streets. Black and Latino residents breathe the fumes and dodge danger. Lawmakers push the Clean Deliveries Act to curb the chaos. The burden falls hard. The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>The Clean Deliveries Act, now under consideration in Albany, aims to regulate last-mile warehouse traffic and emissions across New York State. The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Bay Ridge pols call for help with traffic build-up caused by Verrazzano Bridge closures,' highlights gridlock and reckless driving on residential streets. Brannan, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, pressed the MTA and DOT for early closure notifications and more traffic control. Brannan warned, 'Frustrated drivers... driving up on the sidewalk... affects not just the average driver or pedestrian but... first responders.' Gounardes added, 'Buses literally could not go anywhere.' Local leaders echoed the need for action. The MTA claimed safety as the reason for closures but shifted responsibility for street management to the DOT. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided, but the call centers the danger to pedestrians, transit riders, and emergency crews.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
