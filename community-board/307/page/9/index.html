A BMW ran the red. Both men died where they fell. The driver fled. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. Since 2018, <strong>drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, brothers, neighbors.</p><h2 id=the-slow-grind-of-policy>The Slow Grind of Policy</h2><p>The city started talking about a fix in 2014. It is now 2025. The plan sits stalled. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>asked, &ldquo;What is going on? There&rsquo;s been no conversation, no updates.&rdquo;</a> State Senator Andrew Gounardes stood at the crash site and <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said, &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Councilmember Alexa Avilés called for real investment, not more studies. The city’s answer was a sign: “Be careful.” Gounardes called it an insult. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway.

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (April 1, 2025) reports that Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn has seen 20 deaths since 2014, with nearly 2,400 injuries since 2012. On March 30, Miriam Yarimi, driving with a suspended license and 93 prior traffic violations, crashed into an Uber and then into a family, killing Natasha Saada and two of her children. A third child remains in critical condition. The article quotes Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives: Ocean Parkway is 'one of Brooklyn's most dangerous roads.' Residents and advocates demand stronger safety measures, including speed-limiting technology for repeat offenders. Mayor Eric Adams is open to lowering the speed limit, but state approval is needed. Despite Vision Zero, Ocean Parkway remains hazardous for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, announced March 31, 2025, would require drivers with 11+ license points in two years or six camera tickets in a year to install speed-control devices for one year. The bill is sponsored by State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher. Gounardes said, 'My legislation would require repeat reckless drivers to install speed limiters, so they can no longer use their vehicles as a deadly weapon.' Gallagher added, 'We have the tools and the knowledge to prevent these tragedies from happening.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Families for Safe Streets support the bill, calling it a powerful tool to protect everyone from super speeders. The bill awaits committee action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash also left a 4-year-old boy in critical condition. Yarimi faces manslaughter, negligent homicide, assault, reckless driving, and more. Her license was suspended. Her car had 99 violations in a year, including 21 speeding and five red-light tickets. Advocates, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, blame Albany’s delay in passing Senator Andrew Gounardes’s bill to require speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders. Furnas said, “If Albany had passed this bill when it was first introduced, this vehicle would already have been speed limited and this crash would never have happened.” The bill remains pending.
