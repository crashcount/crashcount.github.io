A BMW came fast. It did not stop. The car hit them. Both men died in the street. The driver ran. Police later arrested him and charged him with manslaughter and leaving the scene. The men were named Kex Un Chen and Faqiu Lin. They were walking to a food pantry. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-men-crossing-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very heartbroken. He was a good person,&rdquo; said Lin&rsquo;s sister.</a></p><p>This was not the first time. It will not be the last. In the last 12 months, <strong>2 people died and 706 were injured</strong> in traffic crashes in Brooklyn CB7. Six were seriously hurt. The dead are mostly on foot or bike. The numbers do not stop. CBS New York <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-killed-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run/>reported</a> the car &ldquo;drove through a Brooklyn intersection, hitting and killing them as they crossed the street.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-corridor-of-broken-promises>The Corridor of Broken Promises</h3><p>Third Avenue is wide. It is fast. It is deadly. The city had a plan to fix it. The plan would have narrowed lanes and added protection. The community board supported it. The city paused the plan after business owners complained. Since then, 96 crashes have injured 80 people. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-pedestrians-on-third-ave-corridor-eric-adams-refuses-to-make-safer>&ldquo;It was only a matter of time before somebody else died on this corridor and here we are,&rdquo; said Julio Peña.</a></p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Alexa Avilés co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and to legalize crossing mid-block, ending jaywalking tickets. These are steps forward. But the city has not finished the job. The mayor and DOT have the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it. The redesign for Third Avenue is still on hold. The dead wait for action.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-do-not-lie>The Numbers That Do Not Lie</h3><p>Since 2022, <strong>13 people have died and 2,243 have been injured</strong> in traffic crashes in Brooklyn CB7. Cars and trucks killed or hurt 212 people on foot. Motorcycles and mopeds, 15. Bikes, 32. The toll is steady. The pain is not spread evenly. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city finish the job. Lower the speed limit. Build the safety projects.

The pedestrian was found in the roadway with fatal head trauma and crush injuries. The report notes, 'No skid marks. No damage to the truck.' The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'Only silence where a life had been.' The vehicle, a 2020 INTL-TRUCK/BUS registered in Indiana, showed no visible damage. The driver was licensed in Pennsylvania. The report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The police report does not cite any pedestrian actions as contributing to the crash. The absence of skid marks and damage underscores the brutal efficiency of the impact.

The new proposal drops the peak toll from $15 to $9. The plan’s status is pending, with urgency to implement before a new presidential administration. Gounardes stressed, “It’s more important than ever that we start congestion pricing immediately, before Trump can block it.” The bill aims to fund the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan, but economist Charles Komanoff warns, “You don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.” The measure is meant to reduce traffic and improve transit, but the lower toll means less impact. The MTA has already paused $16 billion in work. The focus is on starting the program, but advocates note the diluted toll will not deliver the same safety and quality-of-life gains for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

"The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now."" -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On November 8, 2024, Governor Hochul proposed lowering New York City’s congestion pricing toll from $15 to $9. The plan, a policy proposal to adjust congestion pricing, comes as officials rush to implement it before a new presidential administration can intervene. The original $15 toll, crafted by the Traffic Mobility Review Board and approved by the MTA Board, promised strong traffic reduction and included credits and caps. The $9 version, previously reviewed in environmental assessments, may lack those protections. Economist Charles Komanoff warns, 'You lose other benefits. Most noticeably, you don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes urges swift action, saying, 'The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now.' The lower toll is projected to improve traffic speeds by only 6.4 percent, far less than the 17 percent expected from the original plan. With less traffic reduction, streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
