Two men stepped into the crosswalk at 52nd Street and Third Avenue. A BMW ran the red. The car did not slow. Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were hit and left in the street. Both died where they fell. The driver sped away. Police caught him later. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>told police</a>.</p><p>The men were trying to reach a food pantry. &ldquo;We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of two individuals in Sunset Park this morning. Our thoughts are with their families and loved ones. We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said City Harvest</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last 12 months, Brooklyn CB7 saw 2 killed, 6 seriously hurt, and over 700 injured in 1,031 crashes. In the first half of 2025, 1 person is dead, 4 are seriously hurt, and 420 are injured. The dead are mostly people on foot or bike. The old, the young, the ones with nowhere else to go.</p><h2 id=the-same-streets-the-same-danger>The Same Streets, The Same Danger</h2><p>Neighbors say drivers speed on that stretch. The city’s own data shows 59 crashes and 80 injuries in three blocks around the site in five years. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>reported CBS New York</a>. The blood dries, but the danger stays.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h2><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Council Member Alexa Avilés co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. Senator Andrew Gounardes voted to renew speed cameras and backed the Stop Super Speeders Act. Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes voted yes to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored a bill for speed limiters. But the citywide speed limit is still above 20 mph. Enforcement is slow. Cameras catch speeders, but repeat offenders keep driving. The laws are not enough. The dead keep coming.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets where the old and the hungry can cross and live. Do not wait for the next body in the road.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The statement reads, 'There's a new member of Families for Safe Streets, which is not good news.' Joe Jankoski, mourning Amanda Servedio, spoke out after her death by a recidivist speeder. The group’s ranks swell with each tragedy. No specific bill or committee is named in this event. Kuntzman’s statement underscores the relentless danger faced by pedestrians and cyclists. The safety analyst notes: the event describes a new member joining an advocacy group, which does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety at the population level. The city’s streets remain perilous. The group’s growth is a grim measure of failure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Officers from the 75th Precinct gave chase. The driver lost control near East 105th Street and Farragut Road, smashing through a fence and landing the vehicle on the Manhattan-bound L train tracks. Eyewitnesses described the chaos: 'Next thing I know, he was into the fence. Absolutely crazy.' The crash left the Jeep mangled and caused overnight subway delays. Police took the uninjured driver into custody at the scene. Charges are pending.

Bill forces reckless drivers to install speed limiters. Lawmakers act after years of carnage. Streets remain perilous for walkers and riders until the law takes hold.</p><p class=mb3>On May 21, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee advanced bill S4045B, known as the Stop Super Speeders bill. The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes, aims to curb reckless driving. Initially, Sen. Anthony Palumbo (R-Suffolk) opposed the measure, citing concerns about government overreach and enforcement. He compared it to ignition locks for drunk drivers, which he supports. After discussion with Gounardes, Palumbo shifted, supporting the bill if it meets its goal. The bill’s summary states it targets repeat speeders with court orders and misdemeanor charges for non-compliance. Data shows 21 percent of fatal pedestrian crashes in NYC involve vehicles with six or more camera tickets in the prior year. Speed limiters have been shown to reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. Palumbo now signals willingness to take strong action against reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
