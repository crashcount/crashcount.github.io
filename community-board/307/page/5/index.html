Since 2022, <strong>13 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,148 have been injured</strong> in crashes. Twenty of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a blink, families left with empty chairs and hospital bills. In the last year alone, <strong>2 people died</strong> and <strong>664 were hurt</strong>. The dead are not numbers. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, struck by a turning sedan on 7th Avenue. A 30-year-old man, crushed by a truck on 60th Street. A 49-year-old cyclist, thrown and killed by a pickup at 53rd and 4th. The street is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed first.</strong> Trucks, sedans, SUVs—they do the killing. In the last three years, cars and trucks took 5 lives, motorcycles and mopeds 1, bikes none. The rest are left with broken bones, crushed limbs, and memories that do not heal. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in CB7, the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city says, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo;</a> The words are right. The action is not enough. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it here. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Every delay is another risk, another family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras, more street redesigns, more action.

Steve Chan slams the move as a blow to city businesses. Closed-door talks continue. Transit riders wait. Streets stay dangerous. No clear safety gains for walkers or cyclists.</p><p class=mb3>State budget negotiations on March 20, 2025, centered on funding for the MTA. Lawmakers discussed raising the payroll mobility tax on large New York City employers. The measure aims to close a $35 billion hole in the MTA’s five-year capital plan, which covers subway and bus upgrades. The bill has no number yet and remains under negotiation. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, 'The discussion on revenue raisers is definitely going to have to be a part of the MTA.' Senator Steve Chan, District 17, criticized the tax hike, calling it 'a slap on the Brooklyn businesses struggling for survival in my district.' The talks also floated surcharges on for-hire vehicles and online deliveries. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The budget deadline looms.

The bill sits before the City Council, with a $2.2 million environmental impact study pledged before a vote. The Committee on Environmental Protection heard testimony on March 4, 2025. The bill summary states it would require 'operators of large last-mile warehouses to use environmentally friendly freight solutions.' Council Member Alexa Avilés sponsors the bill, citing years of truck-driven pollution in Sunset Park and Red Hook. DEP Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala testified, 'Policies like an indirect source rule support this important shift.' Jaqi Cohen of Tri-State Transportation Campaign called for fewer trucks, not just cleaner ones. Avilés stressed the bill’s promise for environmental justice communities battered by truck traffic and pollution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
