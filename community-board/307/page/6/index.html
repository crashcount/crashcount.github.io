The Gowanus. These are the blocks where people don’t make it home.</p><p>Since 2022, at least <strong>15 people have been killed</strong> and 2,407 injured on Brooklyn CB7 streets, with 21 seriously hurt, according to city data covering Jan. 2022–Aug. 25, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Pedestrians account for seven of those dead (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On 3rd Avenue at 52nd Street, a 2011 BMW went straight through the red, police data say. Two men, ages 59 and 80, were crossing with the signal. Both were killed. Contributing factors listed: “Traffic Control Disregarded” and “Unsafe Speed” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4826750</a>).</p><p>A few blocks away, a 30‑year‑old pedestrian died on 4th Avenue near 60th Street after a truck going straight struck him. Listed as “apparent death.” The body injury field says “Head.” The truck showed “No Damage” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4771639</a>).</p><p>A 70‑year‑old woman died at 7th Ave and 44th St. The car was making a left. The line in the record reads “Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.” She was crossing with the signal (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4785620</a>).</p><p>Strong machines. Soft bodies. The ledger stays red.</p><h3 id=where-the-road-bites>Where the road bites</h3><p>The worst sites are named in the city’s files: <strong>4th Avenue</strong> leads with five deaths and 230 injuries. The <strong>Gowanus Expressway</strong> corridor shows two deaths and 343 injuries. <strong>3rd Avenue</strong> shows one death and 155 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data top locations</a>).</p><p>Crashes stack up through the afternoon. Deaths peak at 4 p.m. and 3 p.m., with another spike at 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. Injuries climb from school let‑out to the rush. The hour with the most injuries here is 5 p.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>Listed causes tell the same story: “other” leads, but the killers we know by name show up again—“Failure to Yield,” “Disregarded Traffic Control,” “Unsafe Speed,” “Inattention/Distraction.” Together they cut people down (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data contributing factors</a>).</p><h3 id=two-dead-at-52nd-street>Two dead at 52nd Street</h3><p>The BMW’s front right hit. Two men in the crosswalk went down. Both records say “Crossing With Signal.” Both say “Apparent Death.” The car kept going, per subsequent press coverage of the broader 3rd Avenue carnage that week. At a rally days later, State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said, “Here we are, once again gathering to mourn another preventable tragedy on our streets. But it doesn’t have to be this way” (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/sunset-park-urges-city-to-fast-track-third-avenue-street-fixes-10986450>BKReader</a>).</p><p>DOT’s plan for Third Avenue has been stuck for two years, advocates said at that event. Council Member Alexa Avilés called the corridor “persistently dangerous,” and residents demanded action (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/sunset-park-urges-city-to-fast-track-third-avenue-street-fixes-10986450>BKReader</a>).</p><h3 id=heavy-steel-late-light>Heavy steel, late light</h3><p>Trucks and buses are a small slice of pedestrian injury counts here, but they still kill. One pedestrian death is linked to a truck; sedans and SUVs account for most pedestrian injuries and five pedestrian deaths in the rollup (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data vehicle rollup</a>).</p><p>Night brings a different kind of hit. Deaths rise around 2–4 a.m. The files don’t say why. They don’t need to. The numbers are enough (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data hourly distribution</a>).</p><h3 id=what-to-fix-at-the-worst-corners>What to fix at the worst corners</h3><p>Start with the killers we can touch:</p><ul><li>Harden left turns and give leading pedestrian intervals on 7th Ave at 44th St. The record says “Failure to Yield.” Fix the turn.</li><li>Daylight and protect crossings on 3rd Ave at 52nd St. Two dead, signal obeyed, driver ran the red. Clear sightlines and raised crossings force lower speeds.</li><li>Truck‑calming and routing on 4th Ave near 60th St and along the Gowanus frontage. One pedestrian dead under a box truck’s path; 4th Ave shows the worst toll. Slow the freight where people walk.</li></ul><p>These are standard tools. They work when installed. The files in this district name the places.</p><h3 id=the-laws-that-move-the-needle>The laws that move the needle</h3><p>Albany renewed New York City’s 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. The Governor’s office and the bill’s sponsor said cameras cut dangerous driving. City data show big drops at camera sites (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog</a>; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>).</p><p>Lawmakers also advanced a bill to force <strong>intelligent speed assistance</strong> on repeat violators. Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored S 4045 and voted it through committee; Senator Steve Chan also voted yes (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a>). The target is drivers who stack violations. The aim is simple: cap their speed.</p><p>The city now has the power to set safer speeds under Sammy’s Law, and advocates are pushing a <strong>20 mph default</strong>. The case is blunt: <strong>speed kills</strong>. The call to act is here (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount Take Action</a>).</p><p>Brooklyn CB7’s ledger is public. The bodies fall on 4th Avenue, 3rd Avenue, and under the Gowanus. The names sit in cells and rows.

Danger remains until streets change.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on May 12, 2025, that the city will redesign Conduit Avenue, a three-mile stretch in Brooklyn and Queens where 'more than 40 serious injuries and five deaths' have occurred in five years. The corridor lacks basic pedestrian infrastructure and has 'long stretches without signalized crossings,' which encourages highway-speed driving through residential areas. The Department of Transportation is launching community workshops and an online feedback map to gather public input. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Brooklyn and Queens Residents deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk.' The redesign aims to address systemic dangers and create safer, more connected streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now pending, would let courts require drivers with six or more automated speeding tickets in a year to install speed limiter devices. Salaam’s resolution, co-sponsored by five council members, urges Albany to act. The matter title: 'Council Member Yusef Salaam Throws Support Behind Albany Push To Rein In Speeding Drivers.' Salaam said, 'It's very simple: it's to save lives.' The hearing drew families of crash victims and advocates like Amy Cohen and Darnell Sealy-McCrorey, who lost loved ones to reckless drivers. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and other officials back the measure. Salaam’s leadership signals growing momentum for the first bill of its kind in the country.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
