Two men stepped into the crosswalk at 52nd Street and Third Avenue. A BMW ran the red. The car did not slow. Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were hit and left in the street. Both died where they fell. The driver sped away. Police caught him later. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>told police</a>.</p><p>The men were trying to reach a food pantry. &ldquo;We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of two individuals in Sunset Park this morning. Our thoughts are with their families and loved ones. We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said City Harvest</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last 12 months, Brooklyn CB7 saw 2 killed, 6 seriously hurt, and over 700 injured in 1,031 crashes. In the first half of 2025, 1 person is dead, 4 are seriously hurt, and 420 are injured. The dead are mostly people on foot or bike. The old, the young, the ones with nowhere else to go.</p><h2 id=the-same-streets-the-same-danger>The Same Streets, The Same Danger</h2><p>Neighbors say drivers speed on that stretch. The city’s own data shows 59 crashes and 80 injuries in three blocks around the site in five years. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>reported CBS New York</a>. The blood dries, but the danger stays.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h2><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Council Member Alexa Avilés co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. Senator Andrew Gounardes voted to renew speed cameras and backed the Stop Super Speeders Act. Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes voted yes to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored a bill for speed limiters. But the citywide speed limit is still above 20 mph. Enforcement is slow. Cameras catch speeders, but repeat offenders keep driving. The laws are not enough. The dead keep coming.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand streets where the old and the hungry can cross and live. Do not wait for the next body in the road.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member James F. Gennaro leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gale A. Brewer, Christopher Marte, Alexa Avilés, Farah N. Louis, and Justin L. Brannan. The bill would require commercial e-bikes to be registered and display visible license information. Employers, not delivery workers, would be fined for violations like sidewalk riding. The council frames this as a way to identify dangerous vehicles and hold companies accountable, aiming to reduce injuries and deaths among pedestrians and cyclists.

No more hiding behind vague reports. The city must count each incident. Data will show the toll. Vulnerable New Yorkers deserve the truth.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0255-2024 sits in the Committee on Public Safety after introduction on February 28, 2024. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle," forces the NYPD to add 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a specific reporting category in quarterly and annual use of force reports. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Won, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Avilés, Abreu, Ossé, Krishnan, Williams, Cabán, Nurse, Sanchez, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force. This change brings police violence by car into the light, exposing patterns that endanger pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
