In the last year alone, <strong>six lives ended</strong> and <strong>seven more were shattered</strong> by injuries that will not heal. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just days ago, a BMW ran a red light at Third Avenue and 52nd Street. Two men, Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were crossing. The car did not brake. Both men died in the street. The driver sped away. Police found him later. The charges: manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving, leaving the scene. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pedestrians-hit-and-run-brooklyn/>&ldquo;The vehicle was traveling south on Third Avenue when it struck the pedestrians and sped away.&rdquo;</a> <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pedestrians-hit-and-run-brooklyn/>EMS pronounced both men dead at the scene.</a></p><p>Neighbors know the danger. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>&ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,&rdquo;</a> one said. The line for the food pantry was long that morning. The men were just trying to get by.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-no-end-in-sight>The Pattern: No End in Sight</h3><p>The carnage is not new. In the last twelve months, <strong>686 people were hurt</strong> in crashes here. Children, elders, workers. <strong>SUVs and cars did most of the harm</strong>—eight deaths, 379 minor injuries, 143 moderate, five serious. Trucks and buses killed two, hurt dozens more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the toll, but the deadliest threat is always the car.</p><p>The numbers are steady. The grief is not. Each crash leaves a hole. Each name becomes a number. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-against-safety>Leadership: Votes Against Safety</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have not done enough.</strong> Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein voted against renewing the speed camera program that protects children near schools. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>He opposed safer school speed zones for children.</a> He also voted against reauthorizing the city’s speed camera program, a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>He opposed the safety-boosting speed camera program reauthorization.</a></p><p>Some bills were filed to study or improve crossings, but most died in committee. The streets remain as they were. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every deadly stretch. Demand that repeat offenders lose their right to drive. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, a 21-year-old e-bike rider, unlicensed and unhelmeted, was struck head-on by an unlicensed SUV. The rider was ejected, left unconscious, and suffered severe head bleeding. The SUV carried two occupants, both unlicensed. The report states, 'Traffic control disregarded.' This failure to obey traffic signals or signs was listed as the primary contributing factor for all involved. The e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, but this is noted only after the systemic disregard for traffic control.

The bill required the Department of Transportation to repair any curb deemed a safety hazard during street resurfacing. The matter summary reads: 'requiring that the department of transportation repair broken curbs as part of resurfacing projects.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Schulman, Brewer, Dinowitz, Krishnan, Narcisse, Menin, Yeger, Avilés, Nurse, Gutiérrez, Riley, Brannan, Sanchez, and Louis. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. Broken curbs are a daily threat to pedestrians, especially the elderly and disabled. The bill would have forced the city to address these hazards as part of routine work, but the effort stalled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
