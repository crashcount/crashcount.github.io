The impact threw a 21-year-old male passenger from the e-bike, leaving him with severe lacerations across his body. The report states the victim was ejected and remained conscious at the scene. Police cite 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors in the crash, both attributed to driver actions.
