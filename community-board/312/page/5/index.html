They never made it across. The driver hit them at 68 miles per hour. She ran two red lights. She never braked. The mother and girls died. The boy is still in a coma. The driver’s license was suspended. Her car had 21 speed camera and five red light tickets. She owed $10,000 in fines. She drove anyway. The District Attorney called it <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/16/miriam-yarimi-driver-accused-killing-brooklyn-mom-and-two-kids-in-person-court-appearance/>“one of the worst collisions I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a New York City street”</a>.</p><p>A 19-year-old man tried to cross McDonald Avenue. An EMT, lights flashing, struck him. His head hit the pavement. He left in an ambulance, fighting for his life. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/04/hatzolah-volunteer-emt-driving-smart-car-hits-critically-injures-brooklyn-pedestrian-nypd/>Police are still investigating</a>.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p><strong>In the last twelve months, five people died on these streets.</strong></p><p><strong>Children, elders, and working men and women.</strong></p><p>There were 679 injuries. Seven were serious. One child dead. One elder dead. One cyclist dead.

Nothing stopped the next one. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to keep repeat offenders off the road.

The incident occurred away from any intersection or crosswalk. The narrative states, 'No crosswalk. No cry. He lay still on the pavement, head bloodied, body crushed. The bumper bore the mark.' The child suffered crush injuries to the head and was found unconscious at the scene. The point of impact was the right front bumper of the SUV. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' offering no details on specific driver errors, but the facts remain: a young pedestrian was struck and gravely injured by a driver proceeding straight ahead in a large vehicle. No contributing factors related to the victim’s behavior are cited in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

A female driver, making a right turn, struck the left rear quarter panel of a sedan traveling straight ahead. The contributing factor cited was driver inattention/distraction. Two occupants in the struck sedan—a 21-year-old male driver and a 46-year-old male passenger—suffered back injuries and whiplash but were not ejected. Both were conscious and restrained with lap belts and airbags deployed. The report explicitly notes driver distraction as the cause, with no other contributing factors listed.
