The bill, titled 'Relates to the licensing, registration, purchase, insurance and training for low velocity electric vehicles,' proposes new license classes, a safety manual, operator testing, and mandatory insurance for low-velocity electric vehicles in cities over one million people. Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein (District 48) is the primary sponsor. The bill requires safety instruction as part of pre-licensing courses and sets purchase and registration rules. No safety analyst assessment is available yet. The legislation responds to the rise of electric vehicles and seeks to impose structure and accountability on their use in dense urban areas.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sedan was starting from parking and traveling west when it struck the e-scooter, which was also traveling west and going straight ahead. The point of impact was the center front end of both vehicles, with damage to the sedan’s left front bumper and the e-scooter’s center front end. The e-scooter driver, a 42-year-old male, sustained a head injury and concussion but was conscious and not ejected. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor, specifically implicating the sedan driver’s failure to maintain attention. There are no contributing factors listed for the e-scooter driver.

The pedestrian sustained injuries to her knee, lower leg, and foot, described as contusions and bruises, and was in shock at the scene. The vehicle's point of impact was the center back end, indicating the driver did not stop or yield to the pedestrian. The report lists no contributing factors from the pedestrian but notes unspecified contributing factors overall. The absence of driver yielding to a pedestrian outside an intersection is a critical error leading to this injury. No helmet or crossing signal use was cited as a factor.
