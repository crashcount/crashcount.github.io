Seventeen more are left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> Since 2022, there have been 3,650 crashes. The bodies pile up. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just this spring, a 61-year-old man was killed crossing Bay Parkway. The SUV hit him at the intersection. He died from internal injuries. There was no second chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Children are not spared. Two have died.

Four people over 65 are dead. <strong>The street does not care who you are.</strong></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Seven dead. Five with life-changing wounds. Trucks and buses take two more lives. Motorcycles and mopeds injure and kill. Bikes, too, leave scars, but the numbers are smaller. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the harm.</p><h3 id=words-from-the-street>Words From the Street</h3><p>After a moped struck and killed a 90-year-old man, a neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said, &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>saw the aftermath: &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor.

Council Member Kalman Yeger has voted no on bills to daylight intersections and redesign truck routes for safety. The bills passed anyway, but the message is clear: some leaders stand in the way of change.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The machines do not drive themselves. The laws do not write themselves. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to stand for the living, not the dead. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the NYPD, 'a man driving a cargo van struck both of them while making a left turn.' Gil died from her injuries; her aide was hospitalized. Police did not arrest or charge the driver. The article notes that Gil was the second elderly pedestrian killed in Brooklyn this year, and cites Transportation Alternatives: '46 senior pedestrians were killed in car crashes across the city last year.' The crash highlights the ongoing risk seniors face on city streets, especially at intersections where turning vehicles endanger those crossing on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein (District 48) is the primary sponsor. The bill requires safety instruction as part of pre-licensing courses and sets purchase and registration rules.
