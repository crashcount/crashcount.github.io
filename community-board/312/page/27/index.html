Seventeen more suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the empty seat at dinner, the shoes left at the door.</p><p><strong>Just last week, two men—ages 80 and 59—were killed crossing Third Avenue at 52nd Street.</strong> The driver ran the red light and kept going. Police said the car was &ldquo;speeding southbound&rdquo; and did not brake before impact. Both men died where they fell. City Harvest <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>expressed deep sadness over the tragic deaths</a>, noting the victims &ldquo;may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need.&rdquo;</p><p>A week before, a 70-year-old man was killed crossing Avenue I at East 5th Street. The driver was distracted. The man died at the intersection. No warning, no second chance.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed eight people and injured 522 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The pattern is clear. The danger is not hidden.</p><h2 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h2><p>Local leaders have had chances to act. Some have. Some have not. Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein voted <strong>against renewing the speed camera program</strong> that protects children near schools. He was <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>one of nine city lawmakers to oppose it</a>.</p><p>Senator Sam Sutton missed key votes on bills that would have made school zones safer and forced repeat speeders to slow down. The bills passed anyway, but not with his help. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made upstream. Every delay is a risk pushed onto the most vulnerable. The road will not change itself.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras at every school. Demand that repeat speeders lose their right to endanger your family.</strong></p><p>No more waiting. No more names added to the list. The time to act is now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary reads: 'Requires instruction in pedestrian and bicyclist safety as part of the drivers pre-licensing course.' Primary sponsor: Senator Gounardes, joined by Bailey, Biaggi, Brisport, Cleare, Comrie, and others.

The driver fled but was later found and issued multiple summonses, though not arrested. The crash site remained clogged with illegally parked cars, many marked with MTA vests and NYPD placards. These blockages forced buses to detour and left cyclists at risk. The neighborhood has no protected bike lanes. Local officials—State Sen. Simcha Felder, Assembly Member Peter Abbate, and Council Member Kalman Yeger—have opposed street safety improvements. Abbate, quoted as saying, "Bicyclists need to wear a helmet and be registered," supports more enforcement against drivers but resists bike infrastructure. He doubts DOT safety data and calls for stricter punishment for dangerous drivers, yet maintains opposition to measures that protect vulnerable road users. The MTA stated employees are not exempt from parking rules. The street remains unsafe for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
