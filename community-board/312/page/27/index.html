Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>five lives lost, 677 injured, seven left with wounds that will not heal</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Last week, a 17-year-old boy died after his moped collided with a car on East 8th Street. He was thrown from the seat. His passenger, just 14, left with broken bones. Police said, &ldquo;The teenager was riding a gas moped with a passenger on the back, traveling north on East 8th St. in Midwood when it slammed into a Genesis G80 vehicle operated by a 71-year-old man making a left turn off East 8th St.&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>)</p><p>Days before, a drunk, unlicensed driver killed a moped rider in Bay Ridge. The man died less than half a mile from home. Police said, &ldquo;Moreno was driving west on 67th Street while Mota was driving south on Third Avenue, and he hit her passenger-side door.&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-charged-with-driving-while-intoxicated-without-license-in-fatal-brooklyn-crash>Gothamist</a>)</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price><strong>Who Pays the Price?</strong></h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed seven, injured 374, and left five with serious wounds. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 30. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, sons, mothers.</p><p>A child crossing with his sister. A cyclist crushed by a turning truck. A pedestrian struck in the crosswalk. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances><strong>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</strong></h3><p><strong>Local leaders have failed to act with urgency.</strong> Council Member Simcha Felder has a record of opposing speed cameras and safer street redesigns. After a speeding driver killed three people, Felder made no statement and skipped the funeral. As reported, &ldquo;Felder has a long record of opposing street safety measures, including Vision Zero, speed cameras, speed limits, and street redesigns.&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/01/simcha-felder-longtime-orthodox-brooklyn-pol-and-street-safety-foe-is-m-i-a-after-speeding-driver-kills-three>Streetsblog NYC</a>)</p><p>Assembly Member Michael Novakhov stood at a funeral and said, &ldquo;six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,&rdquo; and claimed, &ldquo;any driver can get much more than six.&rdquo; He called for fewer cameras, not more (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/31/locals-outraged-but-political-elite-yawns-after-a-mom-and-two-kids-are-killed-by-recidivist-speeder>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Some bills have been filed—audits, daylighting, raised speed reducers—but most die in committee or are watered down. The streets remain the same. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-now-stand-up-or-stand-by><strong>What Now? Stand Up or Stand By</strong></h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras where children cross.

Louis, Kalman Yeger, Sandy Nurse, Shahana K. Hanif, and Althea V. Stevens. The bill mandated a four-week comment window and a two-week response period, plus annual reporting and advance notice for temporary changes.

Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Bottcher, and others. The bill responds to service gaps hitting outer boroughs, end-of-line stations, and transit deserts—areas where 600,000 New Yorkers live with poor transit access. The council points to pandemic-era staffing shortages and train cancellations that left riders stranded. The measure aims to push the MTA to close these gaps and connect more New Yorkers to jobs and opportunity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states, 'requiring the placement of temporary priority regulatory signs at intersections within one hour of a report of an inoperable traffic control signal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Julie Won, Kalman Yeger, and Justin L. Brannan sponsored the bill. The session ended with the bill filed, not enacted. Analysts noted that faster signage could 'significantly reduce the risk of pedestrian injury and vehicular collisions at intersections with malfunctioning traffic control signals.'

The bill would have stopped cars from carrying giant ads through city streets. Sponsors wanted to codify an existing rule. The session ended. The bill died. The danger rolls on.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0075-2022 was introduced on March 10, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to ban moving billboards, echoing the matter title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to banning moving billboards.' Council Members Gale A. Brewer (primary), Justin L. Brannan, Erik D. Bottcher, Kalman Yeger, and Lincoln Restler sponsored the measure. The bill sought to codify an existing city rule (34 RCNY 4-12(j)), making it illegal to operate, stand, or park vehicles for commercial advertising. Violators would face a $500 penalty. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
