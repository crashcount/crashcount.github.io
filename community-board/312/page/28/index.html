The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just this spring, a 61-year-old man was killed crossing Bay Parkway. The SUV hit him at the intersection. He died from internal injuries.

Five with life-changing wounds. Trucks and buses take two more lives. Motorcycles and mopeds injure and kill. Bikes, too, leave scars, but the numbers are smaller. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the harm.</p><h3 id=words-from-the-street>Words From the Street</h3><p>After a moped struck and killed a 90-year-old man, a neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said, &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing.

The laws do not write themselves. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to stand for the living, not the dead. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0101-2022 was introduced on March 24, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill required the Department of Transportation to place temporary priority regulatory signs—like stop or yield—at intersections within one hour of a reported inoperable traffic signal. The matter summary states, 'requiring the placement of temporary priority regulatory signs at intersections within one hour of a report of an inoperable traffic control signal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Julie Won, Kalman Yeger, and Justin L. Brannan sponsored the bill. The session ended with the bill filed, not enacted. Analysts noted that faster signage could 'significantly reduce the risk of pedestrian injury and vehicular collisions at intersections with malfunctioning traffic control signals.' The city’s current two-hour response and 24-hour wait for alternative controls left vulnerable road users exposed. This bill tried to close that deadly gap.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Out-of-state cars, often tied to deadly crashes, skirt city rules and costs. The measure aims to crack down on scofflaws and close loopholes that endanger New Yorkers.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0091-2022 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on March 24, 2022, and closed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. The resolution, titled 'Resolution calling upon the New York State Legislature to introduce and pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation increasing penalties on drivers who improperly register vehicles in another state,' was sponsored by Council Members Robert F. Holden, Kalman Yeger (primary), and Justin L. Brannan. The bill cites data showing out-of-state cars are involved in a growing share of city crashes, including 11,000 injuries and 62 deaths in 2021 alone. The council urges Albany to act, targeting drivers who dodge taxes, fees, and insurance by registering elsewhere. The measure seeks to close enforcement gaps that let dangerous drivers slip through, shifting the burden and risk onto city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New York lags behind other states on older driver safety rules.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0090-2022, filed at session’s end, came from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced March 24, 2022, it urges Albany to pass S.5004. The resolution’s title: 'calling upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.5004, to enhance the fitness and safety requirements for certain licensed individuals.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor, District 44) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) led the push. The bill responds to the death of Madeline Sershen, 17, killed by an 88-year-old driver who ran a red. S.5004 would require drivers to prove medical fitness with a physician’s exam after their seventh license renewal. New York’s current rules only demand a vision test every eight years, far less strict than many states. The council’s action highlights a gap in protections for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that the department of transportation maintain curb heights following street construction.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor, District 44) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. The proposal aimed to prevent property flooding and fines by mandating DOT restore curb heights after construction. However, no safety analyst assessed its impact on pedestrians or cyclists. The bill’s focus was property protection, not street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure removed exemptions for gas, oil, and utility trucks. The matter summary reads: 'This bill would prohibit the parking of commercial vehicles owned or operated by gas or oil heat suppliers, gas or oil heat systems maintenance companies or any public utility in residential streets overnight.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Vickie Paladino, and Kevin C. Riley backed the bill. The council filed it at session’s end, on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst weighed in, but the bill’s failure means residential streets remain lined with large trucks, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
