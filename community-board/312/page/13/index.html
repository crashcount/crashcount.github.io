Seventeen more are maimed for life.</strong> Since 2022, there have been 3,637 crashes. The wounds are not just numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at midnight, the blood on the crosswalk, the empty seat at dinner.</p><p>Just this spring, a 61-year-old man was killed crossing Bay Parkway. The SUV kept going straight. The man did not. The city called it <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>an &lsquo;apparent death&rsquo;</a>. No law, no sign, no redesign saved him.</p><p>Fourteen people were hurt when a van slammed into a tree on a Tuesday morning. The van was full of adults with special needs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>said a witness</a>. The tree stood. The people inside did not.</p><h3 id=the-record-of-local-leaders>The Record of Local Leaders</h3><p><strong>Local politicians have not stopped the bleeding.</strong> Council Member Simcha Felder has a record of opposing speed cameras, lower speed limits, and street redesigns. After a speeding driver killed three people this spring, Felder made no statement. He did not show up at the funeral. Streetsblog wrote, &ldquo;Felder has a long record of opposing street safety measures, including Vision Zero, speed cameras, speed limits, and street redesigns.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/01/simcha-felder-longtime-orthodox-brooklyn-pol-and-street-safety-foe-is-m-i-a-after-speeding-driver-kills-three>Streetsblog reported</a>.</p><p>Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein voted against renewing the city&rsquo;s school zone speed camera program. He stood with those who called cameras a burden, not a lifesaver. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>See the vote</a>.</p><p>Some bills have been filed to audit crossings, add speed humps, or improve signage. Most have stalled or been watered down. The dead remain dead. The injured do not heal.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every deadly block. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another siren.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.
