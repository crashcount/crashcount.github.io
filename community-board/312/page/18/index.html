Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,200 hurt since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. They are the man crossing Avenue I, struck and killed by a sedan just days ago. They are the 16-year-old cyclist crushed by a truck on Coney Island Avenue. They are the two men, ages 59 and 80, mowed down by a BMW on Third Avenue. The driver left them in the street and drove away.</p><p>A neighbor said it plain: <strong>&ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>CBS New York</a>. The blood dries, but the danger stays.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the harm.</strong> Thirteen killed or seriously injured by them. Trucks and buses took four more. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they hurt, too, but the carnage comes on four wheels. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. <strong>Two children under 18 killed. Five elders over 65.</strong></p><p>A mother, a father, a friend. The pain does not fade. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said her sister-in-law</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have failed to act with urgency.</strong> Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against safer school speed zones—twice</a>. He opposed <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>reauthorizing speed cameras</a>, a proven tool that saves lives. Council Member Kalman Yeger has <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>dismissed greenway plans and bike lanes</a>, and stood silent as the carnage mounts. State Senator Sam Sutton <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>missed key votes on bills</a> that would force repeat speeders to slow down. The record is clear. The silence is louder.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. <strong>Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras.
