The dead do not speak. The living remember.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the damage.</strong> They killed seven.

Council Member Yeger opposes, citing parking and enforcement.</p><p class=mb3>On June 19, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced upgrades to the Parkside Avenue protected bike lane. The project, managed by Lauren Martin, adds a mid-block crossing and concrete pedestrian islands after cyclist Kala Santiago was killed by a truck at a dangerous crossing. The DOT had installed a two-way protected lane in 2021 but left a key crossing unsafe. The new fix will remove parking spots to improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT also proposed painted bike lanes in Flatbush, Midwood, and Kensington, but not protected lanes, despite high crash rates. Community Board 14 members and advocates urged quick action. Council Member Kalman Yeger opposed all bike lanes in his district, arguing for enforcement before installation. DOT plans to finish the Parkside Avenue upgrade this summer and the wider bike network by next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects.

The law states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of traffic calming devices in senior pedestrian zones.' Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the bill, joined by co-sponsors including Amanda Farías, Tiffany Cabán, and others. The council voted overwhelmingly in favor on April 27, 2023. The law requires the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Department for the Aging, to annually install at least one traffic calming device in each designated senior pedestrian zone, with a minimum of fifty devices citywide per year. DOT must report installation locations to the council every year. The law aims to slow traffic and protect older pedestrians where they are most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No parking near corners. Physical barriers like planters or bike corrals will block cars. High-crash spots get priority. The city must report progress. Streets change. Lives depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0854-2022, now enacted as Local Law 66 of 2023, passed the City Council on April 27, 2023, after review by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The law requires the Department of Transportation to 'implement daylighting at a minimum of 100 intersections a year,' meaning no parking within 15 feet of corners. High-crash intersections must be prioritized unless deemed infeasible. DOT must also install physical daylighting features, such as planters or bike corrals, where possible. Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hudson, Ossé, and others. The law took effect 90 days after enactment. DOT must report annually on locations and reasons for any exceptions. This measure targets the blind spots that kill and injure pedestrians and cyclists at intersections. The city’s streets will see more open corners and fewer hiding places for danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
