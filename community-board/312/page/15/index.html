Seventeen more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In the last twelve months alone, six people died and seven were seriously hurt. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at night, the hush after a crash.</p><p>Just last month, a 17-year-old was killed and a 14-year-old injured when a moped collided with a parked SUV on Avenue N. Days later, a 70-year-old man was struck and killed crossing East 5th Street. The driver was distracted. The man never made it home. <strong>The dead do not get second chances.</strong></p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Since 2022, they have taken eight lives and left 379 people injured in CB12. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The street does not care what you drive. But the bigger the vehicle, the harder the blow.</p><h2 id=leaders-action-or-excuses>Leaders: Action or Excuses?</h2><p>Local leaders have had chances to act. Some have chosen delay or denial. Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein voted <strong>against renewing the speed camera program</strong> that protects children near schools. He also voted no on bills to make school speed zones safer. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC named him among those who &ldquo;voted against speed camera program.&rdquo;</a> The cost is measured in funerals, not fines.</p><p>When the state considered a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the law, local Senator Sam Sutton missed the vote. The silence is loud. The streets stay deadly.</p><h2 id=the-voices-left-behind>The Voices Left Behind</h2><p>After a BMW driver killed two men in a hit-and-run, a neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said &ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway&rdquo;</a>.

I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home&rdquo;</a>. The dead cannot answer.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-thoughts-and-prayers>Call to Action: Demand More Than Thoughts and Prayers</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to back speed cameras, lower speed limits, and support laws that stop repeat offenders. <strong>Every day they wait, another family waits for a knock at the door.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
