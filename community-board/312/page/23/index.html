The dead do not speak. The living remember.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the damage.</strong> They killed seven.

The bill aimed to require every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter, and other legal motorized vehicle to be registered with the Department of Transportation and display a visible license plate. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.' Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections. The streets stayed dangerous. The cars kept their edge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Nicole Malliotakis, who called the plan 'a war on cars.' The toll would fund $15 billion in transit upgrades, including new subway signals and trains.

The bill required agencies to notify council members, community boards, and business districts before removing a traffic lane or parking for 500 feet or three blocks for at least a week. The matter summary reads: 'providing notice and an opportunity for comment before implementing a major traffic change.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor), Francisco P. Moya, Sandra Ung, and Pierina Ana Sanchez backed the bill. It was filed at the end of session, never enacted. The bill would have given local officials ten days to respond to proposed changes, but exempted urgent safety actions. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.
