They never made it across. The driver hit them at 68 miles per hour. She ran two red lights. She never braked. The mother and girls died. The boy is still in a coma. The driver’s license was suspended. Her car had 21 speed camera and five red light tickets. She owed $10,000 in fines. She drove anyway. The District Attorney called it <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/16/miriam-yarimi-driver-accused-killing-brooklyn-mom-and-two-kids-in-person-court-appearance/>“one of the worst collisions I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a New York City street”</a>.</p><p>A 19-year-old man tried to cross McDonald Avenue. An EMT, lights flashing, struck him. His head hit the pavement. He left in an ambulance, fighting for his life. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/04/hatzolah-volunteer-emt-driving-smart-car-hits-critically-injures-brooklyn-pedestrian-nypd/>Police are still investigating</a>.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p><strong>In the last twelve months, five people died on these streets.</strong></p><p><strong>Children, elders, and working men and women.</strong></p><p>There were 679 injuries. Seven were serious. One child dead. One elder dead. One cyclist dead.
