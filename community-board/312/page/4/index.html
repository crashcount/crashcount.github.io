Since 2022, <strong>21 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>Seventeen more were seriously injured</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. In the last year alone, six lives ended and seven more were shattered by injuries that do not heal. Children, elders, men, women. No pattern but the blood on the asphalt.</p><p>Last week, a 90-year-old man tried to cross Avenue U. A blue moped hit him. The rider wore a mask. He did not stop. &ldquo;He hit the guy and he left,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said a witness</a>. The old man died at the hospital. His family waits for answers. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers.</strong> They caused eight deaths and more than 500 injuries in three years. Trucks and buses killed two. Mopeds and motorcycles left one dead, twenty-one hurt. Bikes injured twenty-five. The deadliest wounds come from the biggest machines. But the small ones, too, can end a life.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h3><p>The council votes. The bills pile up. Some would make streets safer. Others stall. Council Member Kalman Yeger voted <strong>no</strong> on bills to redesign truck routes and end jaywalking tickets—measures proven to protect people on foot. He opposed the city’s <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>greenway plan</a> and safer street networks. He was absent for votes on daylighting and pedestrian safety reporting. He did co-sponsor a bill for raised speed reducers at camera locations, but it never became law. The danger remains.</p><p>After the moped crash, neighbors spoke out. &ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said Peter Forte</a>. But words are not enough. The street does not care about speeches.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighted corners. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not delay. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The statement came at the funeral for Natasha Saada and her children, killed by a speeding driver on Ocean Parkway. Novakhov argued, 'six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,' and claimed, 'any driver can get much more than six.' He also denounced speed cameras, saying, 'we have too many,' and that they punish regular drivers. The bill’s matter summary centers on requiring devices for vehicles with six violations in a year. Community members and advocates at the funeral demanded stronger accountability and cited the area’s deadly history. Other local politicians, including Kalman Yeger and Simcha Felder, have also opposed speed safety measures. The Department of Transportation has not recommended major changes to Ocean Parkway, despite ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Audi's driver, Miriam Yarimi, 32, was arrested and charged with manslaughter. Police said she was driving on a suspended license. Investigators are examining whether she ran a red light or was speeding. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.'
