Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>five lives lost, 677 injured, seven left with wounds that will not heal</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Last week, a 17-year-old boy died after his moped collided with a car on East 8th Street. He was thrown from the seat. His passenger, just 14, left with broken bones. Police said, &ldquo;The teenager was riding a gas moped with a passenger on the back, traveling north on East 8th St. in Midwood when it slammed into a Genesis G80 vehicle operated by a 71-year-old man making a left turn off East 8th St.&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>)</p><p>Days before, a drunk, unlicensed driver killed a moped rider in Bay Ridge. The man died less than half a mile from home. Police said, &ldquo;Moreno was driving west on 67th Street while Mota was driving south on Third Avenue, and he hit her passenger-side door.&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-charged-with-driving-while-intoxicated-without-license-in-fatal-brooklyn-crash>Gothamist</a>)</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price><strong>Who Pays the Price?</strong></h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed seven, injured 374, and left five with serious wounds. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 30. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, sons, mothers.</p><p>A child crossing with his sister. A cyclist crushed by a turning truck. A pedestrian struck in the crosswalk. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances><strong>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</strong></h3><p><strong>Local leaders have failed to act with urgency.</strong> Council Member Simcha Felder has a record of opposing speed cameras and safer street redesigns. After a speeding driver killed three people, Felder made no statement and skipped the funeral. As reported, &ldquo;Felder has a long record of opposing street safety measures, including Vision Zero, speed cameras, speed limits, and street redesigns.&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/01/simcha-felder-longtime-orthodox-brooklyn-pol-and-street-safety-foe-is-m-i-a-after-speeding-driver-kills-three>Streetsblog NYC</a>)</p><p>Assembly Member Michael Novakhov stood at a funeral and said, &ldquo;six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,&rdquo; and claimed, &ldquo;any driver can get much more than six.&rdquo; He called for fewer cameras, not more (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/31/locals-outraged-but-political-elite-yawns-after-a-mom-and-two-kids-are-killed-by-recidivist-speeder>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Some bills have been filed—audits, daylighting, raised speed reducers—but most die in committee or are watered down. The streets remain the same. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-now-stand-up-or-stand-by><strong>What Now? Stand Up or Stand By</strong></h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras where children cross.

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead.
