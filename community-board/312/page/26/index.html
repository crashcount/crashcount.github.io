Seventeen more are left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> Since 2022, there have been 3,650 crashes. The bodies pile up. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just this spring, a 61-year-old man was killed crossing Bay Parkway. The SUV hit him at the intersection. He died from internal injuries. There was no second chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Children are not spared. Two have died.

Four people over 65 are dead. <strong>The street does not care who you are.</strong></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Seven dead. Five with life-changing wounds. Trucks and buses take two more lives. Motorcycles and mopeds injure and kill. Bikes, too, leave scars, but the numbers are smaller. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the harm.</p><h3 id=words-from-the-street>Words From the Street</h3><p>After a moped struck and killed a 90-year-old man, a neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said, &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>saw the aftermath: &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor.

Council Member Kalman Yeger has voted no on bills to daylight intersections and redesign truck routes for safety. The bills passed anyway, but the message is clear: some leaders stand in the way of change.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The machines do not drive themselves. The laws do not write themselves. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to stand for the living, not the dead. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill aimed to prohibit commercial establishments—repair shops, rental agencies, maintenance shops—from parking, storing, or idling vehicles on city streets. The matter summary states: 'This bill would prohibit commercial establishments from parking vehicles on city streets as part of their business.' Civil penalties ranged from $250 to $400 per day, with possible impoundment. Sponsors included Kalman Yeger (primary), Carlina Rivera, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kevin C. Riley, Marjorie Velázquez, Erik D. Bottcher, Nantasha M. Williams, and Robert F. Holden. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst assessment was provided. The bill’s failure leaves streets crowded with commercial vehicles, keeping vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver fled but was later found and issued multiple summonses, though not arrested. The crash site remained clogged with illegally parked cars, many marked with MTA vests and NYPD placards. These blockages forced buses to detour and left cyclists at risk. The neighborhood has no protected bike lanes. Local officials—State Sen. Simcha Felder, Assembly Member Peter Abbate, and Council Member Kalman Yeger—have opposed street safety improvements. Abbate, quoted as saying, "Bicyclists need to wear a helmet and be registered," supports more enforcement against drivers but resists bike infrastructure. He doubts DOT safety data and calls for stricter punishment for dangerous drivers, yet maintains opposition to measures that protect vulnerable road users. The MTA stated employees are not exempt from parking rules. The street remains unsafe for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill summary states: 'This bill would change the community board notification process for major transportation projects by defining the construction or removal of a bus lane, busway, or bike lane as a major transportation project, regardless of the number of consecutive blocks or consecutive feet of street that the project alters.' DOT would be required to notify and present plans to community boards, consider feedback, and post quarterly progress reports online. The bill aimed to increase transparency and community input on street changes that affect vulnerable road users, but did not become law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure targets weekday mornings and evenings. Sponsors say it keeps lanes clear for city buses. The bill stalled, filed at session’s end.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0224-2022 was introduced on April 28, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill sought to amend city law to 'restrict the use of bus lanes by sight-seeing buses.' It would have prohibited sightseeing buses from using bus lanes between 7–10 a.m. and 4–7 p.m. on weekdays. The Department of Transportation would also be barred from authorizing sightseeing bus stops in bus lanes during those hours. Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor), Justin Brannan, Sandy Nurse, Lincoln Restler, and Diana Ayala backed the bill. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The bill aimed to keep bus lanes clear for transit, reducing congestion and potential conflict with pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
