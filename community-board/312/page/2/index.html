Seventeen more are marked with serious injuries.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors—the sound of sirens at night, the hush after impact.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 17-year-old was killed on Avenue N. A 14-year-old boy riding behind him was thrown from the moped and left broken in the street. The crash report lists the cause: &ldquo;Passing or Lane Usage Improper. Unsafe Speed.&rdquo; No comfort in the words. Only the fact of a life ended, another changed forever, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 70-year-old man, Dov Broyde, was crossing Avenue I. The driver did not stop in time. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/man-70-fatally-struck-by-brooklyn-smart-car-driver/>&ldquo;The driver plowed into him&rdquo;</a>. Broyde died at the hospital. The driver stayed. No charges were filed.</p><p><strong>Five deaths in the last year. Two were children.</strong></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm: <strong>seven deaths, five serious injuries, 527 total crashes</strong>. Trucks and buses: <strong>two deaths, two serious injuries, 47 crashes</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds: <strong>one serious injury, 21 crashes</strong>. Bikes: none dead, but the wounds are real—<strong>25 crashes with injuries</strong>. The street is not equal. The bigger the machine, the more it takes.</p><h3 id=leaders-votes-and-vacuums>Leaders: Votes and Vacuums</h3><p>The council talks. Sometimes it acts. Council Member Kalman Yeger voted <strong>no</strong> on the bill to end jaywalking tickets—a law meant to stop blaming the dead for their own deaths. He voted <strong>no</strong> on safer truck routes and on the greenway plan. He was absent for votes on daylighting and senior safety. He did co-sponsor a bill for raised speed reducers at camera locations, but the bill died. The silence is louder than the words.</p><h3 id=the-voices-left-behind>The Voices Left Behind</h3><p>&ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; an eyewitness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said after a 90-year-old was struck by a moped and left to die</a>. &ldquo;He hit the guy and he left.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand that the council stop blaming the dead and start protecting the living. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT’s Chris Brunson said, “The narrower street width for vehicles will de-incentivize double parking on the corridor.” The redesign removes a travel lane, adds a protected bike lane, and aims to curb driver behavior that leads to crashes. Between 2022 and 2024, 165 crashes on this mile-long stretch caused one death and injured 15 cyclists and 23 pedestrians. Most pedestrian injuries happened while crossing with the light, showing drivers failed to yield.

Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule.

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses.
