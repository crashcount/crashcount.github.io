Seventeen were left with wounds so deep they are called serious. The dead include children, elders, workers. They are gone. Their families wait for justice that does not come.</p><p>Just last year, a 67-year-old man was killed crossing 15th Avenue at 54th Street. The truck kept going straight. The man did not go home. The data says he was &ldquo;killed&rdquo;—no more, no less. The street stays the same (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash record</a>).</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-young>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Young</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> They account for 7 deaths and over 500 injuries. Trucks and buses killed 2, injured 45. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt 21. Bikes injured 25. The numbers do not lie. The danger is heavy, fast, and metal.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, two under 18 have died. <strong>One was a cyclist, crushed by a turning truck.</strong> Another was a passenger, thrown from a moped. The city counts them. Their parents remember them.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h2><p>The council votes. Sometimes for safety, sometimes against. Council Member Kalman Yeger voted <strong>against safer truck routes and daylighting intersections</strong>—measures proven to save lives. He voted no on the bill that would have made streets safer for people crossing on foot (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council voting record</a>). He voted no on the greenway plan (<a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>NYC Greenway plan</a>). He was absent for votes on bills to protect seniors and daylight crossings. He did co-sponsor a bill to audit dangerous intersections, but it never passed (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council voting record</a>).</p><p>When the council voted to expand 24/7 speed cameras, Yeger supported it (<a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>NYC Council speed camera vote</a>). But when it came time to reauthorize the school zone speed camera program in Albany, Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein voted no (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC report</a>). The cameras work. The votes do not always follow the bodies.</p><h2 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h2><p>A son stood on the street and watched his father die. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop.

Holden (District 30) and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards clashed publicly over the MTA's congestion pricing plan. The dispute, reported by nypost.com, began with Holden calling the plan 'another tax on hardworking New Yorkers' and demanding a referendum. Richards retweeted Holden, suggesting an 'actual Democrat' should replace him, and responded to a supporter with 'Yeah white supremacy.' The exchange escalated, drawing condemnation from other officials. The matter centered on the policy to charge motorists entering Manhattan below 60th Street. Holden joined a bipartisan press conference urging Governor Hochul to let voters decide. The spat revealed sharp divides over congestion pricing, with Holden opposing the plan and Richards defending it. No formal council bill or vote was involved, but the fight highlighted the political and racial tensions surrounding street safety and car use in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan targets neglected neighborhoods. It demands real infrastructure, not just paint. Advocates say it will open safe routes, cut danger, and connect the city.</p><p class=mb3>On October 27, 2022, the City Council passed a bill requiring a comprehensive master plan for New York City's greenways. The legislation, championed by Council Member Carlina Rivera and supported by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), mandates the city to study, map, and expand greenways—'highways for cyclists and pedestrians, separated from motor vehicle traffic.' The bill focuses on low-income and underserved neighborhoods, with a final plan due by December 2024 and updates every five years. Rivera said, 'All of us are here today because we believe in a future where New Yorkers of all backgrounds... can safely access active transportation.' Brooks-Powers called it 'a real opportunity... to make a profound impact.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York praised the move, urging the city to build 'real infrastructure for cycling.' The bill passed nearly unanimously, signaling strong council support for safer, more equitable streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
