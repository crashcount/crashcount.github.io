Since 2022, <strong>21 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>Seventeen more were seriously injured</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. In the last year alone, six lives ended and seven more were shattered by injuries that do not heal. Children, elders, men, women. No pattern but the blood on the asphalt.</p><p>Last week, a 90-year-old man tried to cross Avenue U. A blue moped hit him. The rider wore a mask. He did not stop. &ldquo;He hit the guy and he left,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said a witness</a>. The old man died at the hospital. His family waits for answers. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers.</strong> They caused eight deaths and more than 500 injuries in three years. Trucks and buses killed two. Mopeds and motorcycles left one dead, twenty-one hurt. Bikes injured twenty-five. The deadliest wounds come from the biggest machines. But the small ones, too, can end a life.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h3><p>The council votes. The bills pile up. Some would make streets safer. Others stall. Council Member Kalman Yeger voted <strong>no</strong> on bills to redesign truck routes and end jaywalking tickets—measures proven to protect people on foot. He opposed the city’s <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>greenway plan</a> and safer street networks. He was absent for votes on daylighting and pedestrian safety reporting. He did co-sponsor a bill for raised speed reducers at camera locations, but it never became law. The danger remains.</p><p>After the moped crash, neighbors spoke out. &ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said Peter Forte</a>. But words are not enough. The street does not care about speeches.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighted corners. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not delay. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects. While it aims to protect emergency access, advocates warn it could delay or block street redesigns that save lives for people walking and biking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Civil penalties ranged from $300 to $2,000. Council Member Marjorie Velázquez led as primary sponsor, joined by Feliz, Restler, Yeger, Menin, Schulman, and many others. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst reviewed its impact for vulnerable road users.
