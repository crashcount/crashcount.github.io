Seventeen more have been left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last year alone, five lives ended. Two were children. One was a man in his prime. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>663 injured, 7 seriously, in just twelve months</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Last November, a van changed lanes on Bay Parkway and McDonald Avenue. The driver died. His passenger, a woman, survived with broken bones. In August, a sixteen-year-old on a bike was crushed by a turning truck at Coney Island Avenue and Ditmas. He never made it home. The dead do not speak. The living remember.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the damage.</strong> They killed seven. They injured more than five hundred. Trucks and buses killed two, injured thirty. Motorcycles and mopeds, twenty-one injuries, one death. Bikes, twenty-five injuries, no deaths. The street is not fair.

Council Member Kalman Yeger co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>audit crossings</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>add speed reducers</a>. But he also <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted no on safer truck routes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>no on daylighting</a>, <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>no on greenways</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>no on ending jaywalking tickets</a>.

The official title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to notice requirements for certain transportation projects and the repeal of section 19-187 in relation thereto.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of colleagues. The law repeals the old, separate bike lane notice process and folds it into the broader project notice rules.

The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
