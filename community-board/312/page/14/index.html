Seventeen more are left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> Since 2022, there have been 3,650 crashes. The bodies pile up. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just this spring, a 61-year-old man was killed crossing Bay Parkway. The SUV hit him at the intersection. He died from internal injuries. There was no second chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Children are not spared. Two have died.

Four people over 65 are dead. <strong>The street does not care who you are.</strong></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Seven dead. Five with life-changing wounds. Trucks and buses take two more lives. Motorcycles and mopeds injure and kill. Bikes, too, leave scars, but the numbers are smaller. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the harm.</p><h3 id=words-from-the-street>Words From the Street</h3><p>After a moped struck and killed a 90-year-old man, a neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said, &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>saw the aftermath: &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor.

Council Member Kalman Yeger has voted no on bills to daylight intersections and redesign truck routes for safety. The bills passed anyway, but the message is clear: some leaders stand in the way of change.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The machines do not drive themselves. The laws do not write themselves. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to stand for the living, not the dead. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill orders daylighting at intersections and new signage. It aims to cut crashes, boost visibility, and shrink truck miles. Sponsors demand safer streets for people on foot and bike. Change is now law.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0708-2022, now Local Law 171 of 2023, was enacted by the City Council on December 16, 2023, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
