Seventeen more are left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> Since 2022, there have been 3,650 crashes. The bodies pile up. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just this spring, a 61-year-old man was killed crossing Bay Parkway. The SUV hit him at the intersection. He died from internal injuries. There was no second chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Children are not spared. Two have died.

Four people over 65 are dead. <strong>The street does not care who you are.</strong></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Seven dead. Five with life-changing wounds. Trucks and buses take two more lives. Motorcycles and mopeds injure and kill. Bikes, too, leave scars, but the numbers are smaller. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the harm.</p><h3 id=words-from-the-street>Words From the Street</h3><p>After a moped struck and killed a 90-year-old man, a neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said, &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>saw the aftermath: &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor.

Council Member Kalman Yeger has voted no on bills to daylight intersections and redesign truck routes for safety. The bills passed anyway, but the message is clear: some leaders stand in the way of change.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The machines do not drive themselves. The laws do not write themselves. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to stand for the living, not the dead. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A female driver, making a right turn, struck the left rear quarter panel of a sedan traveling straight ahead. The contributing factor cited was driver inattention/distraction. Two occupants in the struck sedan—a 21-year-old male driver and a 46-year-old male passenger—suffered back injuries and whiplash but were not ejected. Both were conscious and restrained with lap belts and airbags deployed. The report explicitly notes driver distraction as the cause, with no other contributing factors listed. The collision involved a third vehicle, a station wagon/SUV, which was starting in traffic but sustained no damage. This incident highlights how driver errors, specifically inattention during maneuvers like right turns, can cause serious injuries even without victim fault.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned.
