Seventeen were left with wounds so deep they are called serious. The dead include children, elders, workers. They are gone. Their families wait for justice that does not come.</p><p>Just last year, a 67-year-old man was killed crossing 15th Avenue at 54th Street. The truck kept going straight. The man did not go home. The data says he was &ldquo;killed&rdquo;—no more, no less. The street stays the same (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash record</a>).</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-young>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Young</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> They account for 7 deaths and over 500 injuries. Trucks and buses killed 2, injured 45. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt 21. Bikes injured 25. The numbers do not lie. The danger is heavy, fast, and metal.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, two under 18 have died. <strong>One was a cyclist, crushed by a turning truck.</strong> Another was a passenger, thrown from a moped. The city counts them. Their parents remember them.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h2><p>The council votes. Sometimes for safety, sometimes against. Council Member Kalman Yeger voted <strong>against safer truck routes and daylighting intersections</strong>—measures proven to save lives. He voted no on the bill that would have made streets safer for people crossing on foot (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council voting record</a>). He voted no on the greenway plan (<a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>NYC Greenway plan</a>). He was absent for votes on bills to protect seniors and daylight crossings. He did co-sponsor a bill to audit dangerous intersections, but it never passed (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council voting record</a>).</p><p>When the council voted to expand 24/7 speed cameras, Yeger supported it (<a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>NYC Council speed camera vote</a>). But when it came time to reauthorize the school zone speed camera program in Albany, Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein voted no (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC report</a>). The cameras work. The votes do not always follow the bodies.</p><h2 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h2><p>A son stood on the street and watched his father die. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop.

Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push.
