They never made it across. The driver hit them at 68 miles per hour. She ran two red lights. She never braked. The mother and girls died. The boy is still in a coma. The driver’s license was suspended. Her car had 21 speed camera and five red light tickets. She owed $10,000 in fines. She drove anyway. The District Attorney called it <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/16/miriam-yarimi-driver-accused-killing-brooklyn-mom-and-two-kids-in-person-court-appearance/>“one of the worst collisions I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a New York City street”</a>.</p><p>A 19-year-old man tried to cross McDonald Avenue. An EMT, lights flashing, struck him. His head hit the pavement. He left in an ambulance, fighting for his life. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/04/hatzolah-volunteer-emt-driving-smart-car-hits-critically-injures-brooklyn-pedestrian-nypd/>Police are still investigating</a>.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p><strong>In the last twelve months, five people died on these streets.</strong></p><p><strong>Children, elders, and working men and women.</strong></p><p>There were 679 injuries. Seven were serious. One child dead. One elder dead. One cyclist dead. The rest are numbers, but every number is a name, a face, a family. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>SUVs led the killing. Trucks, sedans, bikes, and buses followed.

They talk about safer streets. But the blood dries faster than the laws change.</strong></p><p>After the Ocean Parkway crash, the District Attorney said: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/miriam-yarimi-ocean-parkway-brooklyn-crash/>“What is very clear is that she should not have been on the road that day.”</a></p><p>But nothing stopped her. Nothing stopped the next one. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to keep repeat offenders off the road. It has the power to harden crosswalks and protect the people who walk and ride. Power means nothing if it is not used.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Tell them to protect speed cameras. Tell them to build streets for people, not for cars.
