Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,100 hurt since 2022. The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. In the last year alone, two children died. One was a teenager on a moped. Another was younger, struck while crossing. The pain does not fade. The street remembers.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> Seven killed by SUVs and trucks. One by a sedan. The rest are numbers, but each number is a name, a family, a life ended or broken.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-unanswered>Recent Crashes, Unanswered</h3><p>On June 17, 2024, a 67-year-old man was killed at 15th Avenue and 54th Street. The truck kept going straight. The man did not go home. The record notes only this: &ldquo;Apparent Death&rdquo; and &ldquo;Crossing Against Signal.&rdquo; The driver lived. The pedestrian did not. The system shrugs. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On August 19, 2024, a 16-year-old boy on a bike was crushed by a turning truck at Coney Island Avenue and Ditmas. The truck made a right. The boy was gone. No law, no sign, no camera stopped it.</p><h3 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local politicians have voted both ways.</strong> Council Member Kalman Yeger co-sponsored bills to audit deadly crossings and add speed reducers, but he also voted against safer truck routes, greenway expansion, and the law that ended jaywalking tickets. He was absent for key votes on daylighting and pedestrian safety. When the Assembly voted to renew the city&rsquo;s speed camera program, Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted no</a>.</p><p>The excuses are always the same.

He called speed cameras a punishment for regular drivers.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The deaths are not fate. They are policy.</strong> Every delay, every no vote, every shrug is a choice. The streets do not forgive. <strong>Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. Demand action, not excuses.</strong></p><p>If you wait, another family will grieve.

A female driver, making a right turn, struck the left rear quarter panel of a sedan traveling straight ahead. The contributing factor cited was driver inattention/distraction.

Both were conscious and restrained with lap belts and airbags deployed. The report explicitly notes driver distraction as the cause, with no other contributing factors listed.
