Seventeen more are left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> Since 2022, there have been 3,650 crashes. The bodies pile up. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just this spring, a 61-year-old man was killed crossing Bay Parkway. The SUV hit him at the intersection. He died from internal injuries. There was no second chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Children are not spared. Two have died.

Four people over 65 are dead. <strong>The street does not care who you are.</strong></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Seven dead. Five with life-changing wounds. Trucks and buses take two more lives. Motorcycles and mopeds injure and kill. Bikes, too, leave scars, but the numbers are smaller. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the harm.</p><h3 id=words-from-the-street>Words From the Street</h3><p>After a moped struck and killed a 90-year-old man, a neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said, &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>saw the aftermath: &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor.

Council Member Kalman Yeger has voted no on bills to daylight intersections and redesign truck routes for safety. The bills passed anyway, but the message is clear: some leaders stand in the way of change.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The machines do not drive themselves. The laws do not write themselves. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to stand for the living, not the dead. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Seddio claims the lane will only shift location and disputes the safety benefits, arguing, 'The bike lane will still exist, but merely shift to an alternative location in the road.' He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%. The case highlights ongoing tension between local political power, city notification procedures, and efforts to protect cyclists and pedestrians through street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article quotes the lawsuit: the city acted "improperly, irrationally, without proper legal notice and in an abuse of discretion." Data cited in the suit show the upgraded lane improved safety for all road users. Councilman Lincoln Restler supported the legal action, seeking a restraining order to keep the lane.

The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp.
