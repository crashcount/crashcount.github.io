Mayor Eric Adams said, "there’s going to be a whole rule making process to make sure that we comply and follow the laws." Critics argue the plan singles out e-bikes while ignoring faster, heavier vehicles. Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences." Janet Schroeder of the E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the rule will matter without real enforcement. The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor violations, raising questions about fair and effective policy.

According to the MTA, crews will completely rebuild Williams Bridge and Woodlawn, installing four new elevators—two at each station—to ensure full accessibility. The matter summary states: 'comprehensive renovation and accessibility project at three Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line stations in the Bronx.' Christian Murray reported the announcement. No council bill number or committee applies, as this is an agency initiative, not legislation. The upgrades promise to open transit to riders long shut out by stairs and barriers.

Police charged Michael Aracena, 20, with murder, manslaughter, and criminal possession of a weapon. The article describes the incident as an 'alleged road rage' shooting but does not detail the events leading up to the violence. Campbell was shot three times in the chest while sitting in his gray 2012 Infiniti sedan. His mother, Suzette Thomas, said, 'I want people to remember my son as a humble person, one to do the best for the world.' The case highlights the lethal risk of violent escalation on city streets and the ongoing threat to vulnerable road users from armed drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
