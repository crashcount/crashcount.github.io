An SUV turns left. She does not make it to the other side. She is 24. She dies where the light still blinks. In the last twelve months, 2 people have died and 7 more have suffered serious injuries on the streets of Bronx CB8. 336 have been hurt. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken ribs, crushed skulls, and families left with silence.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars did most of the damage. In three years, SUVs killed three pedestrians and left dozens more bleeding. Trucks, sedans, bikes, and mopeds all played their part. The violence is steady. It does not care about age. Children, the old, the young—no one is spared. The dead do not get to tell their stories. The living carry them.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-words>The Leaders and Their Words</h2><p>When a city bus nearly plunged off the Henry Hudson Parkway, the wall gave way. The bus was trying to avoid a double-parked car. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->said the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, hit the wall, and went through it. Thankfully, nobody was hurt.</a> But the next time, someone will be. Councilman Eric Dinowitz <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->noted that even a very big bus, going slowly, can do a lot of damage, and stressed the importance of enforcing parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car. He pointed out that parking regulations are not being enforced across the city.</a></p><p>Local leaders talk about enforcement. They talk about repairs. They do not talk about speed limits, protected crossings, or the hard work of redesign. The silence is loud. The clock keeps ticking.</p><h2 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Bronx Business Leaders and Local Institutions Want to Halt Bus Fixes on Fordham Rd,' highlights their demand for Mayor Adams to halt improvements meant for 85,000 daily bus riders. The Belmont and Fordham Business Improvement Districts, along with the Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Garden, Fordham University, Monroe College, and St. Barnabas Hospital, argue the changes would 'significantly impact crucial traffic flow' and burden side streets. State Sen. Gustavo Rivera voiced support for transit equity but awaits a traffic study. DOT claims to work with the community.
