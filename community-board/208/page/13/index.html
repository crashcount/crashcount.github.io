An SUV turns left. She does not make it to the other side. She is 24. She dies where the light still blinks. In the last twelve months, 2 people have died and 7 more have suffered serious injuries on the streets of Bronx CB8. 336 have been hurt. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken ribs, crushed skulls, and families left with silence.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars did most of the damage. In three years, SUVs killed three pedestrians and left dozens more bleeding. Trucks, sedans, bikes, and mopeds all played their part. The violence is steady. It does not care about age. Children, the old, the young—no one is spared. The dead do not get to tell their stories. The living carry them.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-words>The Leaders and Their Words</h2><p>When a city bus nearly plunged off the Henry Hudson Parkway, the wall gave way. The bus was trying to avoid a double-parked car. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->said the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, hit the wall, and went through it. Thankfully, nobody was hurt.</a> But the next time, someone will be. Councilman Eric Dinowitz <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->noted that even a very big bus, going slowly, can do a lot of damage, and stressed the importance of enforcing parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car. He pointed out that parking regulations are not being enforced across the city.</a></p><p>Local leaders talk about enforcement. They talk about repairs. They do not talk about speed limits, protected crossings, or the hard work of redesign. The silence is loud. The clock keeps ticking.</p><h2 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Sponsored by Timothy M. Kennedy with support from Jake Ashby, Jamaal Bailey, and others, the bill mandates street designs that protect everyone—not just drivers. The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The bill marks a shift away from car-first planning, forcing cities to build streets for people, not just traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Bills A5259 and S2812 face debate in the New York State legislature. If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action. Vulnerable road users face risk if the program lapses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
