An SUV turns left. She does not make it to the other side. She is 24. She dies where the light still blinks. In the last twelve months, 2 people have died and 7 more have suffered serious injuries on the streets of Bronx CB8. 336 have been hurt. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken ribs, crushed skulls, and families left with silence.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars did most of the damage. In three years, SUVs killed three pedestrians and left dozens more bleeding. Trucks, sedans, bikes, and mopeds all played their part. The violence is steady. It does not care about age. Children, the old, the young—no one is spared. The dead do not get to tell their stories. The living carry them.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-words>The Leaders and Their Words</h2><p>When a city bus nearly plunged off the Henry Hudson Parkway, the wall gave way. The bus was trying to avoid a double-parked car. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->said the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, hit the wall, and went through it. Thankfully, nobody was hurt.</a> But the next time, someone will be. Councilman Eric Dinowitz <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->noted that even a very big bus, going slowly, can do a lot of damage, and stressed the importance of enforcing parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car. He pointed out that parking regulations are not being enforced across the city.</a></p><p>Local leaders talk about enforcement. They talk about repairs. They do not talk about speed limits, protected crossings, or the hard work of redesign. The silence is loud. The clock keeps ticking.</p><h2 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings.

The bill, steered by Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (District 83), marks a major shift in automated enforcement. The matter summary states: 'State legislators are expected to pass a dramatic expansion of red light cameras at New York City intersections.' Assemblymember Jeffrey Dinowitz said, 'People shouldn’t run red lights... when they do that they endanger other people’s lives, and people have died.' Heastie controlled the vote. A separate bill to ticket cars blocking street sweepers failed to reach the floor. Advocates pushed for both measures, but only the camera expansion passed. The next legislative session is in January.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure creates a pilot program to install speed cameras near schools, aiming to catch drivers who exceed posted limits. The authorization for the program expires December 31, 2028. Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push. The vote passed with strong support but faced opposition from several members. The bill’s summary reads: "Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2028."

Introduced June 6, 2024, it urges the State Legislature to let cities raise the cap on commercial overnight parking fines. The matter title reads: "Resolution calling on the State legislature to increase the cap on commercial overnight fines for cities." Council Members Eric Dinowitz (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, and Robert F. Holden back the measure. They argue that capped fines are too low—companies absorb them, streets clog with trucks, and residents pay the price. The Council wants authority to set fines that actually deter illegal parking. The resolution points to nearly 27,000 complaints in 2021 and notes that current enforcement tools are weak.
