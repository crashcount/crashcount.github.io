An SUV turns left. She does not make it to the other side. She is 24. She dies where the light still blinks. In the last twelve months, 2 people have died and 7 more have suffered serious injuries on the streets of Bronx CB8. 336 have been hurt. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken ribs, crushed skulls, and families left with silence.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars did most of the damage. In three years, SUVs killed three pedestrians and left dozens more bleeding. Trucks, sedans, bikes, and mopeds all played their part. The violence is steady. It does not care about age. Children, the old, the young—no one is spared. The dead do not get to tell their stories. The living carry them.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-words>The Leaders and Their Words</h2><p>When a city bus nearly plunged off the Henry Hudson Parkway, the wall gave way. The bus was trying to avoid a double-parked car. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->said the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, hit the wall, and went through it. Thankfully, nobody was hurt.</a> But the next time, someone will be. Councilman Eric Dinowitz <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->noted that even a very big bus, going slowly, can do a lot of damage, and stressed the importance of enforcing parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car. He pointed out that parking regulations are not being enforced across the city.</a></p><p>Local leaders talk about enforcement. They talk about repairs. They do not talk about speed limits, protected crossings, or the hard work of redesign. The silence is loud. The clock keeps ticking.</p><h2 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings.

The collision involved multiple vehicles traveling southbound, including a 2005 sedan, a 2013 sedan, and a 2019 SUV. The 2005 sedan struck the center back end of the 2019 SUV, which was slowing or stopping.

The report states he was 'struck headfirst' and 'ejected,' suffering 'crush wounds to the head.' The cyclist was wearing a helmet and remained conscious after the impact. The front of the bike was damaged, described as bearing 'the scar.' The police report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor, explicitly noting confusion as a cause. No other vehicles or persons are cited in the report. The data does not indicate any driver errors by a motor vehicle operator, and mentions helmet use only after describing the crash and injury. The focus remains on the confusion that led to the cyclist’s severe injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
