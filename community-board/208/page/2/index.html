An SUV turns left. She does not make it to the other side. She is 24. She dies where the light still blinks. In the last twelve months, 2 people have died and 7 more have suffered serious injuries on the streets of Bronx CB8. 336 have been hurt. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken ribs, crushed skulls, and families left with silence.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars did most of the damage. In three years, SUVs killed three pedestrians and left dozens more bleeding. Trucks, sedans, bikes, and mopeds all played their part. The violence is steady. It does not care about age. Children, the old, the young—no one is spared. The dead do not get to tell their stories. The living carry them.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-words>The Leaders and Their Words</h2><p>When a city bus nearly plunged off the Henry Hudson Parkway, the wall gave way. The bus was trying to avoid a double-parked car. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->said the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, hit the wall, and went through it. Thankfully, nobody was hurt.</a> But the next time, someone will be. Councilman Eric Dinowitz <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->noted that even a very big bus, going slowly, can do a lot of damage, and stressed the importance of enforcing parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car. He pointed out that parking regulations are not being enforced across the city.</a></p><p>Local leaders talk about enforcement. They talk about repairs. They do not talk about speed limits, protected crossings, or the hard work of redesign. The silence is loud. The clock keeps ticking.</p><h2 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings.

Patrick Hendry of the Police Benevolent Association claimed officers "lost sight of the car and did not know it crashed," but the family's attorney, Jeremy Feigenbaum, said their investigation "has not corroborated the officers' claim."

The crash occurred midblock at E. 149th St. and Morris Ave. Police said a 2019 Ford Transit van, turning left, hit Fofana as he crossed. The article quotes his sister-in-law: "He was going to buy socks. That's why he crossed the street." Police told the family that after the initial impact, two more vehicles struck Fofana. The driver remained at the scene and faced no immediate charges. Family members called for more safety measures at the busy intersection, noting, "There has to be a cross guard over there for the pedestrian to cross the street safely."

The chase ended near Dyckman Street when the car slammed into a building and caught fire. The officers 'approached the burning SUV but then left without helping the driver or calling for an ambulance.' They did not report the crash. Both have been suspended while the Force Investigation Division and Attorney General review their actions. The incident follows a February NYPD policy change barring pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' NYPD data shows one in four pursuits last year led to crashes or injuries. The crash exposes the risks of high-speed chases and gaps in police accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
