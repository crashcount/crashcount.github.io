An SUV turns left. She does not make it to the other side. She is 24. She dies where the light still blinks. In the last twelve months, 2 people have died and 7 more have suffered serious injuries on the streets of Bronx CB8. 336 have been hurt. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken ribs, crushed skulls, and families left with silence.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars did most of the damage. In three years, SUVs killed three pedestrians and left dozens more bleeding. Trucks, sedans, bikes, and mopeds all played their part. The violence is steady. It does not care about age. Children, the old, the young—no one is spared. The dead do not get to tell their stories. The living carry them.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-words>The Leaders and Their Words</h2><p>When a city bus nearly plunged off the Henry Hudson Parkway, the wall gave way.

He pointed out that parking regulations are not being enforced across the city.</a></p><p>Local leaders talk about enforcement. They talk about repairs. They do not talk about speed limits, protected crossings, or the hard work of redesign. The silence is loud. The clock keeps ticking.</p><h2 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member.

She was crossing in a marked crosswalk without a crossing signal when a westbound sedan struck her at the center front end.

The report cites 'View Obstructed/Limited' as a contributing factor to the crash, affecting both the driver and the pedestrian. The pedestrian sustained head injuries and was in shock. Vehicle damage was reported as none. The collision highlights the dangers posed by driver errors, specifically operating a vehicle without a license and impaired visibility conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
