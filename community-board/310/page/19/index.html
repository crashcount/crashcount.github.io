Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 1,700 hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. The dead include the old and the young. A 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother remembered him simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</a> A man who took his nieces for ice cream. A man who did not come home.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Sedans, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left blood on the street.</strong> The city’s open data is blunt: in the last twelve months, three more deaths, 616 injuries, and not a single month without pain.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>City Hall says the right words. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city touts new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But in CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns.</strong></p><p>The law now lets New York City drop speed limits to 20 mph. The city could act today. It has not. <strong>Every day of delay is another family’s loss.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just paint. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> or <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Demand better. Demand it now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary: 'The program launched with a simple idea of getting reckless drivers' vehicles off our streets, so it's incredibly frustrating and disappointing that we're in this situation,' said Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams showed little urgency. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi said, 'We will look to the advocacy world for support to go to the state and get better restrictions and better enforcement tools.' State Sen.

The Red Hook Civic Association sent a letter urging the MTA to create a regular-fare bus through the Hugh Carey Tunnel. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the push, saying, "The people of Red Hook really deserve this." The MTA rejected the idea, citing congestion in the tunnel and Lower Manhattan. Joana Flores, MTA spokesperson, said it is more efficient for riders to transfer to the subway. Critics, including Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance, countered, "Bad traffic is not an excuse for not improving bus service, it’s an impetus for decongesting the street." Past proposals to extend the M22 or restore the B71 with a Manhattan extension were dismissed over cost and logistics. Advocates argue that buses move more people than cars and that congestion pricing should clear the way for better transit. The proposal remains stalled, leaving vulnerable riders waiting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, led by the Department of Transportation, aimed to create a protected bike lane from the Manhattan Bridge to Barclays Center. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso said, "New York City is regressing on meeting its Vision Zero goals ... and stalled street safety improvements, like those slated for Ashland Place, are a part of the reason why." State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety.

The driver, Faheem Shabazz, had a record of speeding violations. Gounardes, a safe streets advocate, said, 'That's really what this conversation should be about—how are we holding people accountable when they have violations to their record and zero consequences for it.' He supports lowering speed limits and tougher penalties but stressed that enforcement is lacking. Senator Iwen Chu urged the NYC DOT to study the area for safety upgrades, stating, 'We must recognize that our streets need to be designed with safety in mind.' The DOT is reviewing the intersection. The call is clear: repeat offenders face little consequence, and street design still puts pedestrians at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'DOT continues to ignore dangers it created on Brooklyn’s Fourth Ave,' centers on DOT’s decision to replace bike lanes with a second car lane, violating a city law that requires temporary bike lanes during such work. Council Members Lincoln Restler, Alexa Aviles, Shahana Hanif, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and groups like Bike New York and Transportation Alternatives sent a letter demanding the bike lane’s return and physical barriers to stop illegal parking on pedestrian islands. The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
