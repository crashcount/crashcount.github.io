The city has not used it. Speed cameras, proven to cut speeding and injuries, are at risk if Albany lets the law lapse. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired. No renewal yet. <strong>Each day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><p>Local leaders point to intersection redesigns and new bike lanes.
