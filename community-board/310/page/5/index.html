Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 1,700 hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. The dead include the old and the young. A 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother remembered him simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</a> A man who took his nieces for ice cream. A man who did not come home.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Sedans, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left blood on the street.</strong> The city’s open data is blunt: in the last twelve months, three more deaths, 616 injuries, and not a single month without pain.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>City Hall says the right words. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city touts new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But in CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns.</strong></p><p>The law now lets New York City drop speed limits to 20 mph. The city could act today. It has not. <strong>Every day of delay is another family’s loss.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just paint. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> or <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Demand better. Demand it now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Seabrook had been out on bail for a previous crash involving police. On January 8, 2024, he crashed into a Toyota, killing Hayden Wallace and injuring three others. Seabrook fled the scene, abandoning his vehicle. The article notes, "All accidents are useless but this one was even more useless because [Seabrook] had so many other offenses." Seabrook faces 23 charges, including manslaughter, leaving the scene, unlicensed driving, and speeding. The case highlights repeated driver offenses and questions about bail and enforcement. Police needed over a year to arrest Seabrook, who had a history of fleeing crashes and driving without a license.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy cited burdens on working-class drivers and questioned the legality of using toll revenue for transit. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit to challenge the move, arguing the program is settled law and already reduces congestion. State Senators Andrew Gounardes and Zellnor Myrie condemned the action, warning, 'Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system.' The withdrawal aligns with New Jersey's opposition and threatens transit upgrades like elevators for elderly and disabled riders. Local officials and advocates say ending congestion pricing will harm vulnerable road users and worsen street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
