Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 1,700 hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. The dead include the old and the young. A 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother remembered him simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</a> A man who took his nieces for ice cream. A man who did not come home.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Sedans, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left blood on the street.</strong> The city’s open data is blunt: in the last twelve months, three more deaths, 616 injuries, and not a single month without pain.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>City Hall says the right words. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city touts new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But in CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns.</strong></p><p>The law now lets New York City drop speed limits to 20 mph. The city could act today. It has not. <strong>Every day of delay is another family’s loss.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just paint. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> or <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Demand better. Demand it now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Andrew Gounardes backed the plan, citing needed transit upgrades. The bill’s impact on vulnerable road users was not assessed. The debate centers on funding transit versus burdening drivers.

Charges include assault and reckless endangerment.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on November 27, 2024, that a New York City Housing Authority employee was arrested after a chaotic crash in Brooklyn. According to police, the driver, Tanisha Simpson, "swiped an oncoming car," then "drove away, dragging the person several feet and hitting another car with a pregnant woman inside." She struck a third, empty car before New York City Sheriffs arrested her nearby. The pregnant woman was taken to the hospital for evaluation, but no serious injuries were reported. Simpson faces charges of reckless endangerment, assault, and leaving the scene. The incident highlights the dangers of hit-and-run behavior and the risks faced by vulnerable road users at busy intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
