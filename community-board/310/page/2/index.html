Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 1,700 hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. The dead include the old and the young. A 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother remembered him simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</a> A man who took his nieces for ice cream. A man who did not come home.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Sedans, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left blood on the street.</strong> The city’s open data is blunt: in the last twelve months, three more deaths, 616 injuries, and not a single month without pain.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>City Hall says the right words. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city touts new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But in CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns.</strong></p><p>The law now lets New York City drop speed limits to 20 mph. The city could act today. It has not. <strong>Every day of delay is another family’s loss.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just paint. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> or <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Demand better. Demand it now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Quemuel Arroyo, MTA’s chief accessibility officer, called it 'a crucial connection.' The new elevators mark the third Brooklyn station made accessible this year. Improved subway access encourages walking and cycling to transit, boosting safety for vulnerable users by increasing their numbers and visibility.

State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick sponsored the measure. Both praised the program’s record in cutting speeds and saving lives.

Lawmakers dragged their feet. No new laws for safer streets. Pedestrians and cyclists left exposed. The car stays king. The status quo kills. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The 2025 Albany legislative session ended June 25, with lawmakers failing to pass key street safety bills. The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress. No protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
