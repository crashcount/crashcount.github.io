Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 1,700 hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. The dead include the old and the young. A 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother remembered him simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</a> A man who took his nieces for ice cream. A man who did not come home.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Sedans, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left blood on the street.</strong> The city’s open data is blunt: in the last twelve months, three more deaths, 616 injuries, and not a single month without pain.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>City Hall says the right words. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city touts new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But in CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns.</strong></p><p>The law now lets New York City drop speed limits to 20 mph. The city could act today. It has not. <strong>Every day of delay is another family’s loss.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just paint. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> or <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Demand better. Demand it now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

It targets a 15% cut in vehicle miles by 2050. The plan favors safer streets, less pollution, and more ways to get around. Advocates say it’s overdue. The old system kept streets dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Bill S1234, introduced by Senator Andrew Gounardes on April 12, 2023, aims to overhaul New York’s environmental review process. The bill, now before the legislature, would replace the outdated 'level of service' metric—focused on driver delay—with a mandate to reduce total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by 15 percent by 2050. The bill summary states: 'By eliminating the relevance of level of service as a metric and utilizing vehicle miles traveled reduction instead, we can provide a new criteria for determining the significance of transportation impacts.' Gounardes, the bill’s sponsor, argues this shift will cut emissions and promote safer, multimodal streets. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Sara Lind back the measure, calling it a long-overdue update that could finally let safety and climate take priority over car traffic. The bill follows California’s lead and could set a national example.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders and officials slam cuts to B48, fear lost connections. Seniors and disabled New Yorkers face longer walks. Community voices rise. The city’s promise of better service clashes with real, lived needs.</p><p class=mb3>"You have so many people living here who are seniors. You have people with disabilities, you have people who just cannot tolerate the elimination of one stop." -- Alec Brook-Krasny</p><p class=mb3>On April 4, 2023, Council Member Phara Souffrant Forrest and other Brooklyn officials voiced strong opposition to the MTA’s Brooklyn bus network redesign. The draft plan, released in December, proposes increased spacing between stops, route changes, and new 'Rush' service. Key changes include the elimination and rerouting of the B48, which officials say 'removes a vital connection between Western Crown Heights and Greenpoint without any adequate transit replacement.' Forrest and others argue these cuts threaten accessibility for seniors and people with disabilities. Community members warn that longer distances between stops will hit the most vulnerable hardest. The MTA claims the redesign will bring 'more reliable, frequent service with better connections,' but public feedback shows deep concern. The plan remains under review, with workshops ongoing and legal hurdles for new bus lanes due to budget and staffing woes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement.

Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Andrew Gounardes pledged to keep fighting for better frequency. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber praised stable funding. Advocates like Betsy Plum criticized the omission: 'The legislature's budget ignores millions of riders stranded 12, 15, 20 minutes or more on subway platforms and at bus stops.'

The matter summary states: 'Legislators in Albany have proposed a budget to fill the MTA's fiscal hole, avert a fare hike, and fund a small pilot of free buses.' Hoylman-Sigal supported ending Madison Square Garden’s tax break to help fund transit.

The meeting excluded some officials who support shrinking the highway, such as Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, who cite environmental and community health concerns.
