Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 1,700 hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. The dead include the old and the young. A 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother remembered him simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</a> A man who took his nieces for ice cream. A man who did not come home.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Sedans, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left blood on the street.</strong> The city’s open data is blunt: in the last twelve months, three more deaths, 616 injuries, and not a single month without pain.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>City Hall says the right words. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city touts new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But in CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns.</strong></p><p>The law now lets New York City drop speed limits to 20 mph. The city could act today. It has not. <strong>Every day of delay is another family’s loss.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just paint. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> or <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Demand better. Demand it now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Cameras miss them. Streets stay dangerous. Senator Gounardes pushes a bill to pay citizens for reporting illegal plates. Police claim action, but advocates see little change. The bill sits in committee. Ghost cars keep rolling.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill in 2022 to reward citizens who report illegal license plates. The bill remains in committee. The measure would give whistleblowers 25% of the ticket, up to $75. The matter targets drivers who obscure or remove plates to dodge automated enforcement. As city and state agencies rely more on cameras to catch speeders and red-light runners, more drivers hide their plates. The Department of Transportation says cameras failed to ticket over 4% of violators last fall, up from 1% in 2019. Advocates accuse police of lax enforcement and even breaking the law themselves. Gounardes’s bill, still stalled, aims to close this loophole and put power in the hands of citizens. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while enforcement lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter arose after attorney Adam White was arrested for removing plastic from an obscured license plate; charges were later dropped by Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, citing 'insufficient evidence.' The bill, discussed at a press conference, aims to crack down on license plate defacement and illegal parking, which Restler says is rampant among city workers and police. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced a similar bill at the state level. Both lawmakers stress the need for public accountability and tougher enforcement to protect vulnerable road users from drivers who evade responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They demanded more money for the MTA. They want six-minute bus and subway service. They warned against service cuts and fare hikes. They called for gas tax revenue to fund transit. Riders need safe, frequent service.</p><p class=mb3>On November 17, 2022, state legislators and transit advocates pressed for increased MTA funding and six-minute off-peak service. The push comes ahead of the next budget cycle. Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Amanda Septimo, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher led the call. Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warned that cuts or fare hikes would devastate working- and middle-class New Yorkers. The group demanded action to protect and improve transit for all riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The request follows complaints after Schermerhorn Street’s redesign, which added a protected bike lane but made all crossings one-way southbound, causing gridlock and blocking access for services. The Community Board’s Transportation and Public Safety Committee, chaired by Sid Meyer, voted to support the change and insisted DOT maintain and protect the Bond Street bike lane with a physical barrier. Restler said, 'We believe that this proposal will improve traffic flow and enhance the public’s access to essential services, deliveries, and residences.' DOT is reviewing the proposal. The matter centers on the impact of traffic changes on residents and the need to safeguard vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
