Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 1,700 hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. The dead include the old and the young. A 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother remembered him simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</a> A man who took his nieces for ice cream. A man who did not come home.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Sedans, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left blood on the street.</strong> The city’s open data is blunt: in the last twelve months, three more deaths, 616 injuries, and not a single month without pain.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>City Hall says the right words. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city touts new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But in CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns.</strong></p><p>The law now lets New York City drop speed limits to 20 mph. The city could act today. It has not. <strong>Every day of delay is another family’s loss.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just paint. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> or <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Demand better. Demand it now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill (no number given) led by State Senator Andrew Gounardes faces debate in Albany as of May 13, 2022. The bill seeks to renew and strengthen New York City’s school speed zone camera program, which is set to expire June 2. The measure would expand camera hours to 24/7 and increase penalties for repeat offenders, including insurance notification and license suspension. The committee and current status are not specified, but only nine legislative days remain. The bill summary states: 'New York City officials are in conflict with state lawmakers in Albany over the future of school speed zone cameras.' Gounardes is confident in renewal. Mayor Eric Adams and advocates want home rule for NYC on speed cameras and speed limits, but Albany resists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez urges lawmakers to use every tool to fight reckless driving. The bill’s fate will shape the city’s ability to protect pedestrians and cyclists from speeding drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cameras in bike lanes and tougher penalties on the table.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill sponsored by Andrew Gounardes (D-Brooklyn) seeks to renew and expand New York City’s speed and red light camera program. The bill, discussed in May 2022, aims to allow 24/7 automated enforcement and add penalties for repeat offenders, including registration suspensions. The matter summary: 'DOT officials said they’re negotiating amendments to Gounardes’ bill that would further crack down on reckless drivers, including a provision to let the city install cameras to ticket cars in bike lanes.' Gounardes stressed urgency: 'We cannot leave Albany without reauthorizing the speed cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s late push for home rule caused confusion, risking the program’s renewal. The bill is under negotiation as the legislative session nears its end. Eleven people died on city streets that week, underscoring the stakes for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Local power denied.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes’s bill S5602 sought to grant New York City control over its speed and red-light camera programs. The effort failed this session. The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July. Assembly Member William Magnarelli, chair of the Transportation Committee, blamed City Hall for inaction. Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo. Without home rule, New York City’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—face continued risk from political delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He announced a $904 million budget for safety improvements and said, 'We need to find them proactively, and get them off the streets.' Adams called for meetings with precincts and targeting dangerous intersections. But he gave no specifics on enforcement, legislative changes, or expanding the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Advocates like Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) and Sara Lind (Open Plans) welcomed the words but demanded concrete action, especially from the NYPD. The city’s current laws limit its power to remove dangerous drivers. Pending state bills could help, but for now, the mayor’s promise remains just that—words, not protection for those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes and Carroll push the bill. They slam weak rules. Supporters say it will cut road violence. The DMV stays silent. The streets demand better.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill 8667, introduced by Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Bobby Carroll, would require all new drivers in New York State to complete six hours of professional driving instruction before taking the road test. The bill was proposed on March 29, 2022. It is currently under consideration in committee. The measure’s summary states it would mandate 'directed training with a professional.' Gounardes called out the current system, linking lack of experience to crashes and road violence. Carroll said professional training means better drivers. The bill has backing from the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools and the city Department of Transportation. Both stress the need for real training to protect all road users. The DMV has not commented. The bill aims to close deadly gaps in driver preparation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
