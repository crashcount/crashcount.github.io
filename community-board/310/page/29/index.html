His brother remembered him simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</a> A man who took his nieces for ice cream. A man who did not come home.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Sedans, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left blood on the street.</strong> The city’s open data is blunt: in the last twelve months, three more deaths, 616 injuries, and not a single month without pain.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>City Hall says the right words. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city touts new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But in CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns.</strong></p><p>The law now lets New York City drop speed limits to 20 mph. The city could act today. It has not. <strong>Every day of delay is another family’s loss.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just paint.

He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year.

The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0101-2022 was introduced on March 24, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill required the Department of Transportation to place temporary priority regulatory signs—like stop or yield—at intersections within one hour of a reported inoperable traffic signal. The matter summary states, 'requiring the placement of temporary priority regulatory signs at intersections within one hour of a report of an inoperable traffic control signal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Julie Won, Kalman Yeger, and Justin L. Brannan sponsored the bill. The session ended with the bill filed, not enacted. Analysts noted that faster signage could 'significantly reduce the risk of pedestrian injury and vehicular collisions at intersections with malfunctioning traffic control signals.' The city’s current two-hour response and 24-hour wait for alternative controls left vulnerable road users exposed.

Out-of-state cars, often tied to deadly crashes, skirt city rules and costs. The measure aims to crack down on scofflaws and close loopholes that endanger New Yorkers.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0091-2022 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on March 24, 2022, and closed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. The resolution, titled 'Resolution calling upon the New York State Legislature to introduce and pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation increasing penalties on drivers who improperly register vehicles in another state,' was sponsored by Council Members Robert F. Holden, Kalman Yeger (primary), and Justin L. Brannan. The bill cites data showing out-of-state cars are involved in a growing share of city crashes, including 11,000 injuries and 62 deaths in 2021 alone. The council urges Albany to act, targeting drivers who dodge taxes, fees, and insurance by registering elsewhere. The measure seeks to close enforcement gaps that let dangerous drivers slip through, shifting the burden and risk onto city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Justin Brannan, representing District 47, called the law a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn't be some huge colossal victory.' The law aims to bypass restrictive federal guidelines that block safety fixes. Council members and residents blasted DOT for slow, arbitrary action and years of denied requests, sometimes only reversed after tragedy. The Adams administration promises to redesign 1,000 more intersections, but families and advocates demand faster, decisive protection for children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight over SUV privilege continues.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 0009, sponsored by Brooklyn Council Member Justin Brannan, was introduced on February 10, 2022. The bill would have forced parking garages to charge the same rate for all light-duty vehicles under 8,500 pounds, including SUVs and sedans. Brannan withdrew the bill on February 15, 2022, after backlash from safe-streets advocates. The bill summary stated: 'This bill requires parking garages to charge the same rate for all light duty vehicles weighing 8,500 pounds or less, including sedans, vans, sports utility vehicles, and pick-up trucks.' Brannan said, 'I agree with what the advocates are saying, based on the language on that bill. The language as introduced did not reflect what I was after. We withdrew it to amend it.' He admitted the bill failed to address the dangers of large vehicles. Brannan now seeks a mechanism to charge more for heavier, more dangerous cars, not less.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
