Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 1,700 hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. The dead include the old and the young. A 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother remembered him simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</a> A man who took his nieces for ice cream. A man who did not come home.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Sedans, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left blood on the street.</strong> The city’s open data is blunt: in the last twelve months, three more deaths, 616 injuries, and not a single month without pain.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>City Hall says the right words. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city touts new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But in CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns.</strong></p><p>The law now lets New York City drop speed limits to 20 mph. The city could act today. It has not. <strong>Every day of delay is another family’s loss.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just paint. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> or <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Demand better. Demand it now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, described as bringing 'a full suite of safety upgrades and fully repair[ing] the roadbed,' will include concrete curb extensions, pedestrian islands, raised crosswalks, new crosswalks, and traffic signals. Brannan, who advocated for the funding, said, 'Why is the city allowing this to happen on New Utrecht Avenue?' and pushed for an earlier construction start.

The clock keeps ticking.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0905-2023 was introduced on February 2, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to amend city law to require the Department of Transportation to finish all street resurfacing work within two weeks. If more time was needed, the department would have to notify the community, stating the reason and new timeline. The matter summary reads: 'ensure that all work associated with the resurfacing of any street is finalized within 2 weeks from the start of work.' Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by thirty other members. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst reviewed the impact, but torn-up streets are a known threat to pedestrians and cyclists. The bill is dead. The hazard lives on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The speech promised a $375-million investment in public spaces, permanent open streets, and a push for zero-emission for-hire vehicles by 2030. Adams also highlighted bills targeting reckless drivers and announced a new Director of the Public Realm. The mayor said, 'We will require the 100,000-plus high-volume for-hire vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2030.' Council Member Andrew Gounardes praised the ROADS Act, saying it 'could save hundreds of lives each year.' But advocates like Open Plans and Betsy Plum criticized the lack of action on transit equity, parking reform, and access for low-income New Yorkers. The address left out bus lane expansion, Fair Fares growth, and city fleet reduction, drawing fire for missing bold, systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection lacked a pedestrian crosswalk. Council Member Justin Brannan attended the vigil and tweeted, 'Confronting traffic violence also means taking personal responsibility [and] safe driving habits. It will take all of us.' The driver remained at the scene but faced no charges. Fruchter’s son Lev condemned the New York Automobile Insurance Plan for letting dangerous drivers stay insured. Community leaders, including NYC Comptroller Brad Lander and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, joined in mourning and frustration. Fruchter’s wife Rachel was also killed by a reckless driver in 1997, a tragedy that helped spark Vision Zero. Nearly three decades later, traffic laws remain weak. No systemic change. Vulnerable road users still pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
