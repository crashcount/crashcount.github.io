Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 1,700 hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. The dead include the old and the young. A 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His brother remembered him simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</a> A man who took his nieces for ice cream. A man who did not come home.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Sedans, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all have left blood on the street.</strong> The city’s open data is blunt: in the last twelve months, three more deaths, 616 injuries, and not a single month without pain.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>City Hall says the right words. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city touts new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But in CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No bold redesigns.</strong></p><p>The law now lets New York City drop speed limits to 20 mph. The city could act today. It has not. <strong>Every day of delay is another family’s loss.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just paint. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> or <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Demand better. Demand it now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, described as 'DOT continues to ignore dangers it created on Brooklyn’s Fourth Ave,' centers on DOT’s decision to replace bike lanes with a second car lane, violating a city law that requires temporary bike lanes during such work. Council Members Lincoln Restler, Alexa Aviles, Shahana Hanif, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and groups like Bike New York and Transportation Alternatives sent a letter demanding the bike lane’s return and physical barriers to stop illegal parking on pedestrian islands. The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Transportation Committee, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a final report on the program’s effectiveness. The bill required drivers with 15 speed-camera or five red-light tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. Council Member Shahana Hanif voiced disappointment, noting, 'We need to not only reauthorize this program, but strengthen it.' Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data. The lack of enforcement leaves dangerous drivers on the road and vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transparency demanded.</p><p class=mb3>On September 7, 2023, the MTA faced backlash for failing to deliver on its pledge of eight-minute weekday headways for the R train in southern Brooklyn. The issue, reported by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, surfaced after riders complained of waits as long as 16 minutes. The MTA had announced service upgrades, but later changed its press release, citing F line track work as the cause for delay—work unrelated to the R train. Gounardes, who fought for MTA funding in Albany, accused the agency of misrepresenting the improvements, saying, 'I’m shocked and frustrated that the MTA would misrepresent these service upgrades to the riding public.' Transit advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance echoed calls for honesty: 'Public transit shouldn’t be a rollercoaster of mismatched expectations.' The incident has strained relations between the MTA and its legislative supporters, highlighting the need for transparency and reliability in transit service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C. Carroll, and Sarahana Shrestha. The bill cracks down on repeat offenders, forcing them to install technology that blocks speeding.

This stretch of Atlantic Avenue is notorious for deadly crashes. Council Member Lincoln Restler responded, stating, “Our community is unified in demanding immediate changes to dramatically slow down traffic, improve safety at intersections, and install new mid block crossings.” The incident marks the second fatal crash on this corridor in 2023. Despite calls from Restler and other local officials for mid-block crossings and traffic calming after previous deaths, the city has not acted. The bill or action is a public statement, not legislation, but it highlights urgent demands for redesign and enforcement to protect vulnerable road users. No safety improvements have been implemented yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to amend the city code by 'increasing civil penalties for operating a bicycle, bicycle with electric assist, or electric scooter on the sidewalk.' The measure would have raised fines up to $510 for endangering others, with double penalties for repeat violations and extra penalties for physical contact. Council Member Gale A. Brewer sponsored the bill, joined by Gennaro, Lee, Brannan, Yeger, Kagan, Vernikov, and Ariola. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst assessed its impact on vulnerable road users. The bill focused on sidewalk riding, but left the core danger—cars on city streets—untouched.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
