Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2025, Brooklyn Community Board 1 voted 18-15 to request a 20 mph speed limit for Greenpoint and Williamsburg. The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Delarosa faces charges of manslaughter, leaving the scene, fleeing police, and possession of stolen property.

Nydia Velázquez led a Queens town hall to rally opposition against Trump Administration policies, including the federal move to block New York City's congestion pricing plan. The event, held at Sunnyside Community Services, featured Council Member Julie Won (District 26) and other local officials. The panel condemned the rollback of protections for immigrants and the firing of NLRB board member Gwynne A. Wilcox. Velázquez declared, 'We’ll see him in court,' after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revoked federal approval for congestion pricing. She pledged to fight budget cuts targeting vulnerable communities and criticized tax breaks for the wealthy. Julie Won joined the call for grassroots activism.

The law demands the Department of Transportation install pavement markings or temporary lines within five business days after any street resurfacing. If DOT misses the deadline, it must notify the public and explain the delay. The bill’s matter title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing pavement markings.' Council Member Farah N. Louis led as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Schulman, Banks, Farías, Carr, and Ariola. The law took effect March 15, 2025. Timely markings close the deadly window when streets lack crosswalks and lanes, protecting people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
