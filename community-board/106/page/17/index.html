The matter, reported as 'MTA in dark over Gov. Hochul’s talks to revive congestion pricing with lower tolls,' highlights confusion and division. Hoylman-Sigal supports lowering the toll, saying, 'The goal should be mend it don’t end it.' He urges keeping the program alive to save mass transit. Sen. Liz Krueger is open to tweaks if goals are met. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow opposes any revival. The MTA faces a $15 billion shortfall after the program’s pause. Policy experts warn that lowering the toll could weaken congestion relief and transit funding. No clear plan exists.

Cameras and sensors gather dust. The MTA’s budget hangs in limbo. Councilman Keith Powers urges repurposing the tech for speed and red-light cameras. No plan emerges. Vulnerable road users wait. Streets stay dangerous. The clock ticks.</p><p class=mb3>On June 8, 2024, New York’s congestion pricing program was paused indefinitely, leaving $500 million in installed infrastructure unused. The matter, titled "$500M of taxpayer dough wasted? Hochul, MTA lack Plan B for NYC congestion pricing infrastructure," highlights the lack of contingency plans from the MTA and Governor Hochul. Councilman Keith Powers (District 4), a supporter of congestion pricing, called for repurposing the equipment for red-light, speed, and noise camera enforcement, and tracking vehicles with fake or obscured plates. Critics, including Vito Fosella and Joe Borelli, questioned the process and future use of the equipment. The indefinite pause leaves the MTA’s capital projects unfunded and vulnerable road users exposed, as enforcement tools sit idle and no alternative safety measures are in place.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No replacement for the lost $1 billion. Transit riders and street users face uncertainty. Lawmakers call the move reckless. The city waits. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
