A 23-year-old cyclist killed by a sedan on 3rd Avenue. A 61-year-old pedestrian left bleeding and semiconscious after a truck hit her in the crosswalk at Lexington and 37th. In the last twelve months, one person died and fourteen suffered serious injuries on these streets. Five hundred seventy-one were hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age: children, elders, workers, all are in the count.</p><h3 id=the-system-enforcement-that-misses-the-mark>The System: Enforcement That Misses the Mark</h3><p>The city says it wants safety. But the law is a blunt tool. Cyclists are ticketed for crossing with the walk signal, even though the law allows it. The summons is $190. The officer said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 99% sure you&rsquo;re wrong about the 2019 law&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/bicyclist-files-class-action-suit-against-nypd-over-red-light-summonses-AC4589266>reported the West Side Spirit</a>). The lawsuit calls it &ldquo;knowing, purposeful, malicious, and outrageous&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/13/us-news/cyclist-sues-nypd-alleging-cops-wrongfully-dole-out-red-light-tickets-malicious-and-outrageous/>wrote the New York Post</a>). The city’s own rules are ignored. The most vulnerable are punished for surviving.</p><h3 id=the-leaders-progress-delays-and-silence>The Leaders: Progress, Delays, and Silence</h3><p>Local leaders point to Vision Zero, new bike lanes, and intersection redesigns. They say every life matters. But the speed limit remains 25 mph. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower it to 20 mph. They have not done it. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The city asks for patience. The dead cannot wait.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-demand-action-now>What You Can Do: Demand Action Now</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand the law protect the living, not punish the vulnerable.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action today.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A 2016 Ford SUV was making a left turn westbound when it collided with a northbound bicyclist. The bicyclist, a 50-year-old male, sustained contusions and injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot but remained conscious and was not ejected. The report cites 'View Obstructed/Limited' as a contributing factor for both the SUV driver and the bicyclist. The SUV's point of impact was the center front end, indicating the driver failed to yield or adequately check for the bicyclist while turning. No safety equipment was reported on the bicyclist, but this was not listed as a contributing factor. Vehicle damage was minimal, but the bicyclist was injured, underscoring the danger posed by limited visibility and driver errors during left turns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
