Thirty more left with serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, there have been over 3,400 crashes. The wounded are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 49-year-old man crushed by a bus at 3rd Avenue and East 28th Street. An 81-year-old woman killed by an SUV on East 59th. A 23-year-old cyclist, dead on East 21st, struck by a sedan. The blood dries, but the ache stays.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-harm>The Vehicles That Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed two, left hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses killed one, left dozens more with broken bodies. Bikes and e-bikes, too, are in the tally—one dead, scores injured. The streets are not safe for anyone on foot or on two wheels. The risk is everywhere, at every hour.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Some leaders have acted. <strong>State Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes</strong> on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. She also backed the renewal of school speed zones. But the city has the power to do more. <strong>The Council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph right now.</strong> They have not. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><p>Council Member <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>Keith Powers called for action</a>: &ldquo;[The state] certainly should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>he said</a>, after congestion pricing was paused and enforcement tools sat idle. The tools to save lives gather dust while bodies gather in the morgue.</p><h3 id=the-voices-on-the-street>The Voices on the Street</h3><p>Residents see the danger. After a crash, a woman named Nita said, <strong>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>she told CBS New York</a>. The city knows. The state knows. Still, the carnage continues.</p><h3 id=what-you-must-do>What You Must Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the asphalt.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Manhattan Community Board 5 called this move not a "real solution" to safety, urging a return to the 2021 plan with protected bike lanes and faster bus service. "We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue," said CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia. The board warns that without bike lanes, cyclists will ride sidewalks, risking conflict. The plan, shaped with business interests, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and delays safer changes until at least 2028.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a 'highly-anticipated 34th Street busway,' had support from Council Members Erik Bottcher, Keith Powers, and others. Bottcher called it 'transformative,' promising fewer crashes and faster buses. Powers slammed the last-minute reversal. Safety analysts warn: canceling the busway preserves car dominance, discourages transit, and keeps streets unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. The project’s future is uncertain.
