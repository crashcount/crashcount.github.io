Protected bike lanes will come, but car lanes stay open during peak hours. The plan falls short of full safety measures. The road remains dangerous. Victims still count. No one is satisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, Mayor Adams announced a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious Brooklyn corridor. The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They called the crash 'entirely predictable' and demanded Mayor Adams immediately implement the Department of Transportation’s stalled safety redesign. The DOT’s plan, which includes narrowing the street and adding a protected bike lane, faces opposition from powerful donors. The mayor’s office claims traffic safety is a priority, but the plan remains in limbo.
