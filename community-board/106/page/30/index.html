A bus killed a 49‑year‑old man at 3rd Ave and E 28th just after dawn on June 16, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>). An SUV struck and killed an 81‑year‑old woman on E 59th in 2024; the driver was unlicensed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>). A 65‑year‑old cyclist died at 2nd Ave and E 15th in July 2025. The SUV went straight. The bike changed lanes. The bike rider died (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p></li><li><p>The FDR takes bodies. First, Second, and Third take blood.

One fix.</p><ul><li>First Avenue. Second Avenue. Third Avenue. Protected space and hardened turns would slow the hit. Daylighting the corners would clear the view. On truck routes, tighten lanes and set off‑set stop bars. Focus enforcement on repeat hotspots and heavy vehicles. These are direct answers to the board’s leading factors: distraction, failure to yield, and the rest of the endless “other” that hides speed and carelessness in a box (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>small‑area factors</a>).</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li><p>City Hall will redesign 14th Street next year.

This year to date, crashes are up about a third over last year’s pace; deaths rose from 0 to 3 in the same span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a>).</p></li><li><p>By mode since 2022 in this board: cyclists 3 dead and 487 injured; pedestrians 3 dead and 484 injured. Occupants 1 dead, 1,027 injured.

Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, but the city still chooses how fast its streets will be and who gets to speed again. The tools exist.

Two bills would force companies to provide safe batteries and fireproof charging. FDNY and city officials backed the push. Delivery workers face grave risk. Action is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2023, the City Council held a hearing on e-bike battery safety. The focus: Intro. 949 and Intro. 950. These bills, sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers, would require the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Sanitation, and FDNY to run a buyback program for safe lithium-ion batteries and mandate companies provide fireproof charging containers. The matter title calls on delivery app companies to 'step up' and protect workers from deadly battery fires. Powers declared, 'We're failing as policy makers if we're not protecting folks from that.' Assistant Commissioner Carlos Ortiz and FDNY Code Counsel Julian Bazel testified in support. Both bills have majority Council backing. The Adams administration supports the spirit of the buyback. Delivery workers, mostly low-income immigrants, face high costs for safe batteries and deadly risk from unsafe ones. In 2023 alone, 63 lithium-ion fires caused 52 injuries and five deaths. The Council’s action targets this systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort comes as New York City faces a surge in deadly fires caused by uncertified lithium-ion batteries used by delivery workers. The initiative, supported by Mayor Adams and Council Member Keith Powers, aims to get safer, certified batteries into the hands of low-income delivery workers. Powers introduced legislation for a citywide buy-back program, stressing, 'we have to make sure that alongside shutting down the market for unsafe batteries, we remember that there are people affected by this.' Uber will also donate $100,000 to the FDNY Foundation for e-bike safety education. The city’s recent plan to combat battery fires highlights the need for private companies to take responsibility.
