Thirty more left with serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, there have been over 3,400 crashes. The wounded are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 49-year-old man crushed by a bus at 3rd Avenue and East 28th Street. An 81-year-old woman killed by an SUV on East 59th. A 23-year-old cyclist, dead on East 21st, struck by a sedan. The blood dries, but the ache stays.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-harm>The Vehicles That Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed two, left hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses killed one, left dozens more with broken bodies. Bikes and e-bikes, too, are in the tally—one dead, scores injured. The streets are not safe for anyone on foot or on two wheels. The risk is everywhere, at every hour.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Some leaders have acted. <strong>State Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes</strong> on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. She also backed the renewal of school speed zones. But the city has the power to do more. <strong>The Council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph right now.</strong> They have not. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><p>Council Member <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>Keith Powers called for action</a>: &ldquo;[The state] certainly should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>he said</a>, after congestion pricing was paused and enforcement tools sat idle. The tools to save lives gather dust while bodies gather in the morgue.</p><h3 id=the-voices-on-the-street>The Voices on the Street</h3><p>Residents see the danger. After a crash, a woman named Nita said, <strong>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>she told CBS New York</a>. The city knows. The state knows. Still, the carnage continues.</p><h3 id=what-you-must-do>What You Must Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the asphalt.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill sits with the Assembly. Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Catalina Cruz. Their action signals strong legislative momentum. The bill’s focus: force planners to build streets for people, not just cars. No safety analyst note is available, but the intent is clear—systemic change for vulnerable road users. The bill’s progress can be tracked at the New York Assembly website.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets remain deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On January 5, 2023, a cement truck driver fatally struck 62-year-old Tamara Chuchi Kao as she rode a Citi Bike in Astoria, Queens. The driver turned right from 24th Avenue onto 29th Street, hitting Kao and killing her instantly. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani called the crash 'absolutely heartbreaking,' noting Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in Astoria in 2.5 years. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez blamed 'poorly designed streets,' saying, 'traffic violence is the outcome of poorly designed streets and is a solvable problem.' The area has almost no protected bike lanes. In 2022, Community Board 1 saw 1,979 crashes, injuring 120 cyclists and 163 pedestrians. Politicians and residents demand safer streets, better enforcement, and an end to car dominance. The deadly toll continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced by Councilman Oswald Feliz (District 15) on November 27, 2022. The measure responds to at least 140 e-bike battery fires in 2022, with six deaths and 140 injuries. Feliz said, 'We must ensure that products sold in our city are safe for New Yorkers.' The bill restricts uncertified batteries and supports FDNY’s education campaign. The bulletin warns tenants about the dangers of charging and storing e-bike batteries at home. State Senator Liz Krueger also pushes for tighter battery regulations. The council’s action targets a growing threat to vulnerable residents—delivery workers and tenants—who face deadly fires in their homes and workplaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
