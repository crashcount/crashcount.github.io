A bus killed a 49‑year‑old man at 3rd Ave and E 28th just after dawn on June 16, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>). An SUV struck and killed an 81‑year‑old woman on E 59th in 2024; the driver was unlicensed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>). A 65‑year‑old cyclist died at 2nd Ave and E 15th in July 2025. The SUV went straight. The bike changed lanes. The bike rider died (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p></li><li><p>The FDR takes bodies. First, Second, and Third take blood.

One fix.</p><ul><li>First Avenue. Second Avenue. Third Avenue. Protected space and hardened turns would slow the hit. Daylighting the corners would clear the view. On truck routes, tighten lanes and set off‑set stop bars. Focus enforcement on repeat hotspots and heavy vehicles. These are direct answers to the board’s leading factors: distraction, failure to yield, and the rest of the endless “other” that hides speed and carelessness in a box (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>small‑area factors</a>).</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li><p>City Hall will redesign 14th Street next year.

This year to date, crashes are up about a third over last year’s pace; deaths rose from 0 to 3 in the same span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a>).</p></li><li><p>By mode since 2022 in this board: cyclists 3 dead and 487 injured; pedestrians 3 dead and 484 injured. Occupants 1 dead, 1,027 injured.

Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, but the city still chooses how fast its streets will be and who gets to speed again. The tools exist.

The move follows a cyclist’s death on E. 85th. Advocates demanded action. The board, once resistant, now shifts toward safety for riders.</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 8 (CB8) voted 38-3 to request 'fully protected crosstown bike lanes approximately every 10 blocks between 60th and 110th streets on both sides of Central Park, and a two-way protected bikeway around Central Park.' The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition. Now, the board calls for comprehensive, protected infrastructure to shield vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution followed the death of 28-year-old cyclist Carling Mott, killed by a truck driver on E. 85th Street. The matter, described as a push to 'bring safe bike routes to the neighborhood,' saw support from councilmembers Keith Powers and Julie Menin, who called on DOT to revisit the 85th Street lane and improve safety infrastructure. Advocates and residents backed the plan, demanding action to prevent more deaths. DOT is reviewing the location for possible upgrades.

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, claimed, "the future of New York City is reimagining the use of public space." Mayor Eric Adams said he was open to plazas, bike racks, or curb extensions—anything but more car storage. Despite these statements, the site became street parking. Council Member Keith Powers, representing the district, said, "I would love something more interesting here than parking," and called for renewed discussion on a permanent outdoor dining program. The city’s action contradicts its stated vision. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
