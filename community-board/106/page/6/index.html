Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers.

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cars must turn off. Buses crawl now. Riders lose time. Council Member Powers backs the plan. Activists demand action. Streets jammed with traffic. Pedestrians and cyclists wait for safer passage.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2025, the Department of Transportation proposed a 14th Street-style busway for 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan. The plan, reported by Dave Colon for Streetsblog NYC, would ban through car traffic between Third and Ninth avenues, echoing the successful 14th Street model. Council Member Keith Powers, who rides the M34, voiced strong support: 'If you dedicate a big chunk of a corridor to bus service, you will see strong results.' The proposal is not yet a formal bill and has not reached any council committee. Activists and elected officials with experience on 14th Street back the move, citing faster buses and higher ridership. However, the event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no assessment of safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be made.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
