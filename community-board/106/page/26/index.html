Pedestrian safety hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 10, 2022, Councilman Keith Powers (District 4) and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine called for Mayor Eric Adams to reinstate holiday street closures around Rockefeller Center. The push follows prior years when two crosstown blocks were closed to cars to protect pedestrians. The matter, described as 'NYC pols push Eric Adams to bring back Rockefeller Center holiday street closures,' highlights the risk: 'The crowds are just enormous... it’s frankly unsafe to have tourists pushed off the sidewalk and stepping into traffic.' Powers and Levine sent a letter on November 1 but received no response. Powers said, 'The crowds are crushing and demand is overflowing.' Both officials support making the closures permanent to prevent pedestrians from being forced into traffic during peak tourist season.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates and officials back the move but call it timid. No wider sidewalks. No hardened protection. Paint and plastic mark the limits. Pedestrians and cyclists still face risk.</p><p class=mb3>On October 18, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation presented a redesign for Third Avenue, reviewed by Community Board 8's Transportation Committee. The plan, echoing a 2010 First Avenue project, repurposes 23 feet for cyclists and bus riders between E. 59th and E. 96th streets. Council Member Keith Powers and Borough President Mark Levine endorsed the proposal, with Levine stating, 'The redesign’s commitment to expanded protected bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes will turn this particularly dangerous stretch of the roadway into a safer, more efficient, and forward-thinking artery.' Still, Levine and advocates like Anna Melendez (Transportation Alternatives) pressed for more: wider sidewalks, hardened pedestrian islands, and real physical protection. The plan uses only paint and plastic, leaving pedestrians exposed. The proposal faces a full board vote on October 19, 2022. The city calls it a start, but the danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A spokesperson said, 'This project will expedite commute times, improve pedestrian safety, increase spaces for bikes, and ensure that cars, buses, and bikes can share the road in harmony.' Third Avenue is a Vision Zero priority corridor, scarred by six pedestrian and one cyclist death since 2016. Hundreds of cyclists ride here daily, despite no bike lane.

"We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely."" -- Liz Krueger</p><p class=mb3>On October 12, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) will unveil its Third Avenue redesign proposal to a Manhattan panel. The plan marks the Adams administration's first major street project. The current avenue, with seven northbound car lanes, has seen 703 crashes, one pedestrian death, and 198 injuries since 2019. The matter summary calls for 'reallocation of street space, prioritizing cycling, walking, and public transit over cars.' Advocates like Kate Fillin-Yeh (NACTO) and Paul Krikler (Community Board 8) urge protected bike lanes, busways, and wider sidewalks. Krikler says, 'We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely.' Transportation Alternatives and Community Board 6 echo these demands. The redesign aims to shift space from cars to people, following models like Paris's Rue de Rivoli. The panel's response will shape the future of vulnerable road user safety on Third Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
