Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

Modern signals promise speed, but funding future hangs in balance.</p><p class=mb3>On September 3, 2024, the G train returned to full service after a summer shutdown for signal modernization. The $368 million project, led by the MTA, replaced century-old signals with Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC), aiming for faster, more reliable service. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) praised the MTA’s handling and shuttle bus communication but criticized the city for not creating dedicated bus lanes during the closure, saying, 'They expressed dismay, however, that the city had not constructed a dedicated lane so shuttle buses could move faster.' Restler called for renewed investment in the MTA, including the resumption of congestion pricing, to fund future upgrades. The project continues through 2027, but no more full shutdowns are planned. The lack of bus lanes during the outage left vulnerable riders exposed to slow, crowded streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
