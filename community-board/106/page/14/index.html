A bus killed a 49‑year‑old man at 3rd Ave and E 28th just after dawn on June 16, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>). An SUV struck and killed an 81‑year‑old woman on E 59th in 2024; the driver was unlicensed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>). A 65‑year‑old cyclist died at 2nd Ave and E 15th in July 2025. The SUV went straight. The bike changed lanes. The bike rider died (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p></li><li><p>The FDR takes bodies. First, Second, and Third take blood.

On truck routes, tighten lanes and set off‑set stop bars. Focus enforcement on repeat hotspots and heavy vehicles. These are direct answers to the board’s leading factors: distraction, failure to yield, and the rest of the endless “other” that hides speed and carelessness in a box (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>small‑area factors</a>).</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li><p>City Hall will redesign 14th Street next year.

This year to date, crashes are up about a third over last year’s pace; deaths rose from 0 to 3 in the same span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a>).</p></li><li><p>By mode since 2022 in this board: cyclists 3 dead and 487 injured; pedestrians 3 dead and 484 injured. Occupants 1 dead, 1,027 injured.

Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, but the city still chooses how fast its streets will be and who gets to speed again. The tools exist.

Bottcher leads, joined by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and over two dozen co-sponsors. The law orders the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections each year, up from 100. The city must also run outreach and education. The bill aims to keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike. No more hiding behind parked cars.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>""This is something we should be doing every year across the month of the December, it’s such an easy win for the area in Midtown,"" -- Keith Powers</p><p class=mb3>On December 4, 2024, the Adams administration cut the Fifth Avenue holiday Open Street program in Midtown from three Sundays to just one, shrinking the car-free zone to December 8 between 48th and 55th streets. The Fifth Avenue Association blamed security around Trump Tower. The matter summary reads: 'City scales back hugely popular Fifth Ave. Holiday Open Street despite sales boosts.' Council Member Keith Powers called the move 'surprising' and urged a full return next year. Advocates called it 'frustrating and disappointing.' Mayor Adams had previously praised the program, which boosted sales by $3 million in 2023. The Department of Transportation now touts sidewalk expansion, but the new redesign drops a planned bike lane and may slow buses. Pedestrians and cyclists lose space. The city’s retreat keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
