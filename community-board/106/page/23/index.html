These bills, sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers, would require the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Sanitation, and FDNY to run a buyback program for safe lithium-ion batteries and mandate companies provide fireproof charging containers. The matter title calls on delivery app companies to 'step up' and protect workers from deadly battery fires. Powers declared, 'We're failing as policy makers if we're not protecting folks from that.' Assistant Commissioner Carlos Ortiz and FDNY Code Counsel Julian Bazel testified in support. Both bills have majority Council backing. The Adams administration supports the spirit of the buyback. Delivery workers, mostly low-income immigrants, face high costs for safe batteries and deadly risk from unsafe ones. In 2023 alone, 63 lithium-ion fires caused 52 injuries and five deaths.

The effort comes as New York City faces a surge in deadly fires caused by uncertified lithium-ion batteries used by delivery workers. The initiative, supported by Mayor Adams and Council Member Keith Powers, aims to get safer, certified batteries into the hands of low-income delivery workers. Powers introduced legislation for a citywide buy-back program, stressing, 'we have to make sure that alongside shutting down the market for unsafe batteries, we remember that there are people affected by this.' Uber will also donate $100,000 to the FDNY Foundation for e-bike safety education. The city’s recent plan to combat battery fires highlights the need for private companies to take responsibility.

It was introduced April 11, 2023, and pushed by Council Member Shahana K. Hanif as primary sponsor, with Jennifer Gutiérrez and over twenty others co-sponsoring. The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ ... and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' The SAFE Streets Act package also includes safe passing for cyclists and complete street design mandates. The Council’s action highlights the city’s ongoing fight against reckless driving and the urgent need for stronger protections for people on foot, on bikes, and in cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Oswald Feliz, Marjorie Velázquez, and Lincoln Restler, amends laws to ban selling counterfeit tags, with fines starting at $1,000 for first offenses and $2,000 for repeat violations. The measure was brought before the City Council and discussed at a City Hall press conference. The matter summary states the bill 'goes after the unscrupulous used car dealers profiting considerably off a huge black market for phony tags.' Restler, as a sponsor, joins efforts to curb the spread of ghost cars, which evade speed cameras and tolls, making streets more dangerous for everyone. Lawmakers stress that the goal is deterrence, not revenue, and call for further action from online marketplaces and federal agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council’s $2.7-billion proposal calls for a near-doubling of Fair Fares funding, $3 million for a battery swap and fire outreach program for delivery workers, and $45.1 million more for road paving. The Council also demands increased investment in street safety infrastructure, especially in communities of color facing high crash rates. Brooks-Powers said, 'New Yorkers deserve access to high-quality services and investments in infrastructure citywide.' Council Member Keith Powers called the battery swap program a 'down payment.' The Council’s push aims to restore cuts and address deadly street conditions.

Delivery workers’ safety and livelihoods hung in the balance. Lawmakers targeted sellers, not riders. The bills aimed to stop deadly fires without punishing those who rely on e-bikes to survive.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, the New York City Council advanced a package of lithium-ion battery safety bills. Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
