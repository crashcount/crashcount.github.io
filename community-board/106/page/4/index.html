They say every life matters. But the <strong>speed limit remains 25 mph</strong>. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower it to 20 mph. They have not done it. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The city asks for patience.
