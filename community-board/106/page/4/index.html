Thirty more left with serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, there have been over 3,400 crashes. The wounded are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 49-year-old man crushed by a bus at 3rd Avenue and East 28th Street. An 81-year-old woman killed by an SUV on East 59th. A 23-year-old cyclist, dead on East 21st, struck by a sedan. The blood dries, but the ache stays.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-harm>The Vehicles That Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most damage.</strong> They killed two, left hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses killed one, left dozens more with broken bodies. Bikes and e-bikes, too, are in the tally—one dead, scores injured. The streets are not safe for anyone on foot or on two wheels. The risk is everywhere, at every hour.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Some leaders have acted. <strong>State Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes</strong> on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. She also backed the renewal of school speed zones. But the city has the power to do more. <strong>The Council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph right now.</strong> They have not. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><p>Council Member <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>Keith Powers called for action</a>: &ldquo;[The state] certainly should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>he said</a>, after congestion pricing was paused and enforcement tools sat idle. The tools to save lives gather dust while bodies gather in the morgue.</p><h3 id=the-voices-on-the-street>The Voices on the Street</h3><p>Residents see the danger. After a crash, a woman named Nita said, <strong>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>she told CBS New York</a>. The city knows. The state knows. Still, the carnage continues.</p><h3 id=what-you-must-do>What You Must Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the asphalt.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Policy shifts, but questions remain on safety and congestion.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (June 14, 2025), City Hall approved a plan to ban cars on 34th Street between 3rd and 9th Avenues, creating a dedicated busway. The article details heated opposition from local residents and bus riders, who argued the plan was rushed and lacked proper traffic analysis. Stacy Rauch, a daily bus rider, said, 'The bigger problem is we don’t have enough buses.' Critics worried diverted car traffic would overwhelm nearby streets. The city compared the move to the 14th Street car ban, but residents noted differences in bus frequency. The article highlights accusations of conflicts of interest involving community board members and advocacy groups. The policy aims to prioritize buses and vulnerable road users, but leaves open questions about implementation and neighborhood impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.'

Systemic danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the Adams administration launched the NYC e-bike trade-in program. No bill number or committee is listed, but the $2-million program stems from a 2023 bill by Council Member Keith Powers. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'The Adams administration is both cracking down on e-bikes and providing safer e-bikes to workers.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'This is not just about protecting delivery workers. It’s about protecting them, their families, their neighbors, and all New Yorkers from deadly fires.' Delivery worker William Medina praised the program, but called for expansion. The program lets workers trade uncertified bikes or illegal mopeds for certified e-bikes, but covers only a fraction of the city’s 80,000 delivery workers. The safety analyst notes: Cracking down may burden vulnerable users, while safer bikes help; mixed signals mean no clear safety gain. The city’s approach leaves vulnerable road users in limbo.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill passed both chambers. Cameras catch drivers who endanger kids. The program ends in 2030. Streets near schools may get safer. The vote was not unanimous.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill S 5677, titled 'Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady,' moved through the Senate and Assembly in June 2025. The Senate passed it on June 12, with primary sponsor James Tedisco (District 44) and co-sponsor Patricia Fahy (District 46) leading the push. The Assembly approved it on June 13. The bill sets up automated speed enforcement near schools and sunsets December 31, 2030. The measure aims to catch speeding drivers near children. Some lawmakers voted no, but most supported the move. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the bill targets a known danger zone for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
