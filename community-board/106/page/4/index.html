The city’s night offered no mercy.</p><p class=mb3>A crash at the corner of East 34th Street and 1st Avenue left a 22-year-old woman with severe facial lacerations, according to the police report. The incident involved a convertible traveling north striking the right rear bumper of a westbound sedan. The police report states, 'Alcohol Involvement' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors. The woman, riding as a front passenger and secured by a lap belt and harness, was injured when the convertible hit the sedan, shattering glass. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on driver actions: alcohol use and failure to obey traffic controls. The crash, late at night, underscores the ongoing danger posed by reckless driving and systemic failures on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
