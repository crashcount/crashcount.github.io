The driver turned right from 24th Avenue onto 29th Street, hitting Kao and killing her instantly. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani called the crash 'absolutely heartbreaking,' noting Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in Astoria in 2.5 years. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez blamed 'poorly designed streets,' saying, 'traffic violence is the outcome of poorly designed streets and is a solvable problem.' The area has almost no protected bike lanes. In 2022, Community Board 1 saw 1,979 crashes, injuring 120 cyclists and 163 pedestrians. Politicians and residents demand safer streets, better enforcement, and an end to car dominance. The deadly toll continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass...S.315/A.1416, which would authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program,' was sponsored by Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, Amanda Farías, Julie Won, Carlina Rivera, and Crystal Hudson. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The measure aimed to protect pedestrians and cyclists by slowing traffic where people gather.

Introduced by Councilman Oswald Feliz (District 15) on November 27, 2022. The measure responds to at least 140 e-bike battery fires in 2022, with six deaths and 140 injuries. Feliz said, 'We must ensure that products sold in our city are safe for New Yorkers.' The bill restricts uncertified batteries and supports FDNY’s education campaign. The bulletin warns tenants about the dangers of charging and storing e-bike batteries at home. State Senator Liz Krueger also pushes for tighter battery regulations. The council’s action targets a growing threat to vulnerable residents—delivery workers and tenants—who face deadly fires in their homes and workplaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
