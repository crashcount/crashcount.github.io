Their letter cites 429 injuries and four pedestrian deaths along Broadway between August 2011 and May 2022. The officials wrote, 'This stretch of Broadway needs to be made safer, and we believe pedestrianization, with limited necessary entries for vehicles that must access certain points along Broadway, could be a way to positively transform the area and benefit all New Yorkers.' Business leaders, including Dan Biederman of the 34th Street Partnership, now support the plan, calling it good for economic development. The push follows a recent taxi crash at Broadway and 29th Street that injured six. The city’s Broadway Vision plan promises to pedestrianize much of the corridor from Union Square to Columbus Circle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They say DOT’s plan is weak. They want Broadway for people, not traffic. The push follows blood on the street.</p><p class=mb3>On July 1, 2022, Council Member Keith Powers and Manhattan officials called for the pedestrianization of Broadway in Midtown. The proposal urges the Department of Transportation to close Broadway to most vehicles between 14th and 34th Streets next year, with future expansion to 42nd Street. The matter follows a severe June 20 crash where a taxi hit a cyclist. The politicians’ letter states: 'A safer, more pedestrian-friendly corridor must be achieved quickly.' Powers, along with Mark Levine, Carlina Rivera, and Erik Bottcher, argue the city’s current plan—limited to small plazas and traffic restrictions—is not enough. They demand bold action to protect pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s response: their plans already include many changes, but the council members say it falls short.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
