Same ending.</p><ul><li>A box truck turned right at 80th Street and Juniper Blvd North. It struck a 54‑year‑old on a bicycle. He died. Police logged “Traffic Control Disregarded.” The trucker was injured. The record is cold and plain: one dead cyclist, one turning truck. The city file is here: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4807280</a>.</li><li>On Maurice Avenue, a truck going straight hit a 47‑year‑old on a bike. The man died. The form lists “Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way” and “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4705063</a>.</li><li>Motorcycles keep paying the price on local highways: a 26‑year‑old on the LIE, dead; a 39‑year‑old at Eliot Ave and 69th St, dead; a 39‑year‑old on the Jackie Robinson Parkway, dead.

No mercy in the fields of numbers.</p><p>Heavy machines, soft targets</p><ul><li>Trucks and buses loom large in the harm to people on foot. In this district’s pedestrian injuries, trucks caused 19 cases, with three deaths, while SUVs and cars injured far more people overall. The split is here: <a href=#>PeriodStats vehicle rollup</a> and causes of pedestrian injuries by vehicle type in the same file.</li><li>Bicyclists are not spared. Four cyclists are dead in the period. 263 were hurt. Pedestrians: six dead, 408 hurt. The city’s rollup puts it in black and white in the small‑area file.</li><li>Two corridors stand out for carnage: the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Long Island Expressway</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Jackie Robinson Parkway</a>. CB5 also lists <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Maurice Avenue</a> among the deadliest local streets.</li></ul><p>The clock tells on us</p><ul><li>Death peaks cluster late afternoon into evening. The small‑area data shows deaths spiking at 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and again near 10–11 p.m. See the hourly table in the CB5 analysis.</li><li>“Failure to Yield” and distraction appear on fatal bike cases here. “Unsafe speed” barely shows in forms, but the harm does not care about checkboxes.</li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>80th Street at Juniper Blvd North. A right‑turning box truck killed a cyclist. Harden the turn. Daylight the corner. Give a leading pedestrian and bike interval. The fatal file: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4807280</a>.</li><li>Maurice Avenue. A truck driver failed to yield and struck a cyclist. Build protected bike lanes and a protected intersection. Freight keeps moving; people should live. The fatal file: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4705063</a>.</li><li>Cypress Avenue and the highway edges. Repeat injuries stack up. Cut speeds with narrow lanes, raised crossings, and hardened centerlines. The CB5 list flags <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Cypress Avenue</a> as a top injury site.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>City Hall has the tools. Albany handed over one. Sammy’s Law lets NYC lower the default speed. Our site’s call to action lays it out: drop to 20 mph citywide now. See <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>Repeat speeders drive a lot of the killing. The state bill to force speed limiters on habitual offenders moved in June. Senators, including Michael Gianaris and Joseph Addabbo Jr., voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. Our call to “Stop Super Speeders” spells it out in plain terms: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>The Council moved to strip city parking permits from drivers with obscured plates. Council Member Robert F. Holden co‑sponsors <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1358‑2025</a>, which targets plate tampering that hides speed and red‑light violations.</li></ul><p>The horror keeps pace</p><ul><li>In the last 12 months, five people died on CB5 streets. 945 were hurt. The year‑to‑date death count is up from last year at this point. The CB5 period stats show the rise.</li><li>Top locations by harm: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Long Island Expressway</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Jackie Robinson Parkway</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Maurice Avenue</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Cypress Avenue</a>.</li></ul><p>What breaks the spell is not a speech. It is a wrench and a vote. Slow turns. Protected lanes. Lower limits. Limit the repeat speeders. Then count fewer bodies.</p><p>Bold steps are on the table. Use them. <a href=/take_action/>Act now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The editorial slams the plan’s $638 million price tag and attacks its supporters. No mention of safety. The fight is about money, not lives on the street.</p><p class=mb3>On December 16, 2022, an editorial targeted State Senator Michael Gianaris (District 12) for supporting a proposal to make all New York City buses free by 2026. The piece, titled 'Sen. Gianaris’ latest ‘bust the MTA’ budget idiocy,' appeared in the New York Post. It claims the plan would add $638 million a year to the MTA’s deficits and criticizes the idea as reckless. Gianaris, along with Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, is called out for joining the push. The editorial’s focus is fiscal: 'making all city buses free by 2026... would add an estimated $638 million a year to the MTA’s multi-billion dollar deficits.' There is no assessment of how this policy would affect vulnerable road users. The debate here is about budgets, not street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal boosts bus service, freezes fares, and expands camera enforcement. They call it urgent. The plan aims to make transit faster, cheaper, and safer for all riders.</p><p class=mb3>On December 14, 2022, Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris introduced the Formula Three Act, a legislative proposal to overhaul MTA funding and fare policy. The plan, part of the larger Fix The MTA Package, would phase in free local and Select Bus Service, increase bus frequency by 20%, freeze fares, and expand permanent bus lane camera enforcement. Funding would rise from $200 million in 2023 to $638 million in 2026, with $488 million yearly for more buses and $300 million annually for frequent subways. Mamdani called the proposal 'urgent and necessary,' stressing that 'seniors, working class New Yorkers, people who use the bus the most are able to do so without fear of being priced out.' Gianaris said, 'incrementalism...is not working.' The lawmakers urge bold action to ensure public transit is accessible, affordable, and excellent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
