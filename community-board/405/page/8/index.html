He died where he fell. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>&ldquo;The bicyclist was an adult male who was pronounced dead at the scene.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No answers. Just a sheet on the road and a family left behind.</p><p>A 23-year-old woman, Breanna Henderson, crossing Myrtle Avenue at Woodhaven Boulevard. A Yamaha motorcycle struck her in the dark hours before dawn. She died at Jamaica Hospital. The rider stayed. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>said, &ldquo;At this time there are no arrests and the investigation remains ongoing.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last year, four people died on these streets.

The city built new bike lanes, redesigned intersections, but the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p>No local leader has stood at these corners and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has promised a timeline. No one has faced the families. The silence is heavy.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The bill is named after Priscilla Loke, killed by an electric Citi Bike rider. Legal experts Daniel Flanzig, Peter Beadle, and Brandon Chamberlin argue the bill violates state law, which bars cities from imposing fees that restrict the 'free use' of bicycles. They warn it would create barriers to e-bike use and could lead to inconsistent rules across cities. Holden defends the bill as a push for 'accountability and safety.' Critics say it discourages e-bike use and risks police harassment, especially for immigrants. The city Law Department declined comment. The bill’s legal standing and impact on vulnerable road users remain sharply contested.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
