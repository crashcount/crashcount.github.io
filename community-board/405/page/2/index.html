He died where he fell. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>&ldquo;The bicyclist was an adult male who was pronounced dead at the scene.&rdquo;</a> No arrests.

A Yamaha motorcycle struck her in the dark hours before dawn. She died at Jamaica Hospital. The rider stayed. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>said, &ldquo;At this time there are no arrests and the investigation remains ongoing.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last year, four people died on these streets.

The city built new bike lanes, redesigned intersections, but the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p>No local leader has stood at these corners and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has promised a timeline. No one has faced the families. The silence is heavy.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The statement reads, 'There's a new member of Families for Safe Streets, which is not good news.' Joe Jankoski, mourning Amanda Servedio, spoke out after her death by a recidivist speeder. The group’s ranks swell with each tragedy. No specific bill or committee is named in this event. Kuntzman’s statement underscores the relentless danger faced by pedestrians and cyclists. The safety analyst notes: the event describes a new member joining an advocacy group, which does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety at the population level. The city’s streets remain perilous. The group’s growth is a grim measure of failure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety for vulnerable users finally comes to the bridge.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, New York City completed a long-stalled plan to separate cyclists and pedestrians on the Queensboro Bridge. The project, first announced under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced delays after Mayor Eric Adams took office. The north outer roadway is now for cyclists, the south for pedestrians. State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, District 12, praised the completion, saying, 'After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [the city's Department of Transportation] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge.' Gianaris also criticized the unexplained delays. The plan ends years of conflict and danger for vulnerable road users forced to share a narrow lane.
