Since January 2022, twenty-two people have died in crashes. Thirty more suffered injuries so severe they changed lives. Over 2,600 have been hurt. These are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, workers, elders. The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just this spring, a 54-year-old cyclist was killed by a turning box truck on Juniper Boulevard North. The crash left the rider ejected, crushed, dead at the scene. The driver survived. The bike was demolished. No one walks away from that. The data says: one more life gone, one more family broken. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On Maurice Avenue, a 47-year-old man on a bike was killed by a truck. He had no chance. The truck kept going straight. The cyclist did not. The record shows: crush injuries, apparent death, ejected.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>Cars and SUVs did the most harm. They caused 1 death and 333 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses killed 3, injuring 27 more. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 1, injured 12. Bikes injured 9. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are not in your favor.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Robert Holden has backed bills for raised speed reducers at camera locations and for safer crossings. But he also voted no on ending jaywalking enforcement—a law that would have protected the most vulnerable from police crackdowns and blame. The council passed it anyway. The law now says: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><p>Holden did support new protected bike lanes on Cypress Avenue, a rare move. His office <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/new-protected-bike-lanes-will-connect-to-ridgewood-reservoir>said</a>, &ldquo;This particular lane benefits those biking to and from the Ridgewood Reservoir and addresses a broader quality of life issue along Cypress Avenue.&rdquo;</p><p>But the pace is slow. The bodies pile up. The city waits.</p><h2 id=the-voices-we-cannot-ignore>The Voices We Cannot Ignore</h2><p>After a bus crash in Queens, a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said</a>, &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo;</p><p>Another rider, holding her baby, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said</a>, &ldquo;That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Now</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand raised crosswalks, protected bike lanes, and real accountability for repeat offenders. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The e-bike rider, a 33-year-old male wearing a helmet, was ejected from his vehicle and sustained facial injuries with minor bleeding. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, indicating the sedan driver failed to properly observe the bicyclist. The bicyclist's own confusion or error is noted but does not mitigate the primary driver fault. The point of impact was the sedan's left front bumper hitting the e-bike's center front end. The crash occurred at 17:10, and the bicyclist was left in shock. The sedan driver was licensed and operating a 2003 Volkswagen SUV. This collision underscores the dangers posed by distracted drivers making turns in the presence of vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
