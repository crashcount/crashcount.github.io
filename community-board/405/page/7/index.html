The collision resulted from an 'Unsafe Lane Changing' maneuver by a vehicle, which cut too close and struck a taxi. The taxi sustained damage to its left side doors, while the SUV hit the taxi with its right front bumper. Two passengers in the taxi’s rear seats, a 33-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman, both suffered head injuries including a concussion and contusions. Both were not wearing safety equipment and were left in shock. The report cites 'Unsafe Lane Changing' and 'Other Vehicular' factors as causes.

Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.'

Holden (District 30) publicly condemned Governor Kathy Hochul’s statements about improved subway safety. The criticism followed a deadly day: a sleeping straphanger was set on fire and killed in Brooklyn, and a double stabbing on the 7 train in Queens left one dead. Hochul had posted, 'crime is going down, and ridership is going up,' citing National Guard deployment, NYPD support, and new subway cameras. Holden called the governor’s timing 'incredible' and said, 'Hochul’s incompetence is costing lives.' The matter, covered by nypost.com, highlights the disconnect between official safety claims and the brutal reality for vulnerable riders. No council bill was filed, but the public rebuke underscores the urgent danger faced by New Yorkers in transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden of District 30, mentioned in the case, called the ruling 'disappointing' and pledged to keep fighting the 'congestion tax scam.'

Powers pressed for fair access, saying, 'we're still hearing from families whose children aren't receiving an OMNY card like their classmates.' Council Member Robert Holden pushed for e-bike licensing, drawing fire from advocates.
