The split is here: <a href=#>PeriodStats vehicle rollup</a> and causes of pedestrian injuries by vehicle type in the same file.</li><li>Bicyclists are not spared. Four cyclists are dead in the period. 263 were hurt. Pedestrians: six dead, 408 hurt. The city’s rollup puts it in black and white in the small‑area file.</li><li>Two corridors stand out for carnage: the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Long Island Expressway</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Jackie Robinson Parkway</a>. CB5 also lists <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Maurice Avenue</a> among the deadliest local streets.</li></ul><p>The clock tells on us</p><ul><li>Death peaks cluster late afternoon into evening. The small‑area data shows deaths spiking at 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and again near 10–11 p.m. See the hourly table in the CB5 analysis.</li><li>“Failure to Yield” and distraction appear on fatal bike cases here. “Unsafe speed” barely shows in forms, but the harm does not care about checkboxes.</li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>80th Street at Juniper Blvd North. A right‑turning box truck killed a cyclist. Harden the turn. Daylight the corner. Give a leading pedestrian and bike interval. The fatal file: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4807280</a>.</li><li>Maurice Avenue. A truck driver failed to yield and struck a cyclist. Build protected bike lanes and a protected intersection. Freight keeps moving; people should live. The fatal file: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4705063</a>.</li><li>Cypress Avenue and the highway edges. Repeat injuries stack up. Cut speeds with narrow lanes, raised crossings, and hardened centerlines. The CB5 list flags <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Cypress Avenue</a> as a top injury site.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>City Hall has the tools. Albany handed over one. Sammy’s Law lets NYC lower the default speed. Our site’s call to action lays it out: drop to 20 mph citywide now. See <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>Repeat speeders drive a lot of the killing. The state bill to force speed limiters on habitual offenders moved in June. Senators, including Michael Gianaris and Joseph Addabbo Jr., voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. Our call to “Stop Super Speeders” spells it out in plain terms: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>The Council moved to strip city parking permits from drivers with obscured plates. Council Member Robert F. Holden co‑sponsors <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1358‑2025</a>, which targets plate tampering that hides speed and red‑light violations.</li></ul><p>The horror keeps pace</p><ul><li>In the last 12 months, five people died on CB5 streets. 945 were hurt. The year‑to‑date death count is up from last year at this point. The CB5 period stats show the rise.</li><li>Top locations by harm: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Long Island Expressway</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Jackie Robinson Parkway</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Maurice Avenue</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Cypress Avenue</a>.</li></ul><p>What breaks the spell is not a speech. It is a wrench and a vote. Slow turns. Protected lanes. Lower limits. Limit the repeat speeders. Then count fewer bodies.</p><p>Bold steps are on the table. Use them. <a href=/take_action/>Act now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
