Twelve left with life-changing wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, Queens CB5 has seen 1,267 crashes. Seven hundred forty-four people were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>Just this spring, a cyclist was killed on Juniper Boulevard North. A box truck turned right. The man on the bike was thrown and crushed. He died there, helmet or not. The truck kept rolling. The street stayed open. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> confirms the toll.</p><p>A few months before, a 47-year-old cyclist was killed on Maurice Avenue. An SUV and a truck. The man was ejected, died of crush injuries. No one else died. The road was cleared. The city moved on.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Most of the dead are not behind the wheel.</strong> They walk, they ride, they cross. In three years, cars and SUVs caused 334 pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and buses, 27. Motorcycles and mopeds, 12. Bikes, 9. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not.</p><p>A bus crash in Flushing left eight hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he “misjudged the curb.” Video showed he had fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. “I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said a passenger</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken steps, but the pace is slow.</strong> Senator Gianaris and Assembly Member Hevesi both voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bills to force repeat speeders to slow down</a>. But the default speed limit remains above 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers still roam free. Each delay is a risk paid in blood.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph default. Demand action on repeat speeders. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>Act now.

The fight pits open space against transit justice in Queens.</p><p class=mb3>On September 16, 2022, Mayor Adams announced the start of the QueensWay project, a $35 million plan to turn a defunct LIRR branch in Queens into a linear park. The first phase includes $5 million for environmental review and $30 million for the Metropolitan Hub. The matter summary states: 'converting a defunct LIRR branch into a Highline-style park in Queens.' Council Member Lynn Schulman supports the park, calling it 'shovel-ready.' Borough President Donovan Richards and Assembly Members Jenifer Rajkumar and David Weprin back both the park and the QueensLink transit proposal. Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation. The debate continues over whether the right-of-way should serve parks, transit, or both.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
