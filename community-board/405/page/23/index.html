He died where he fell. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>&ldquo;The bicyclist was an adult male who was pronounced dead at the scene.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No answers. Just a sheet on the road and a family left behind.</p><p>A 23-year-old woman, Breanna Henderson, crossing Myrtle Avenue at Woodhaven Boulevard. A Yamaha motorcycle struck her in the dark hours before dawn. She died at Jamaica Hospital. The rider stayed. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>said, &ldquo;At this time there are no arrests and the investigation remains ongoing.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last year, four people died on these streets.

The city built new bike lanes, redesigned intersections, but the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p>No local leader has stood at these corners and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has promised a timeline. No one has faced the families. The silence is heavy.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The hearing, part of the state budget process, saw Lieber defend Governor Hochul’s proposed 5.5-percent fare increase as a return to regular hikes paused during the pandemic. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and colleagues pushed the 'Fix the MTA' package to freeze fares, boost service, and make buses free. Mamdani argued, 'It is simply not acceptable to put the cost of a basic public good on the backs of working class New Yorkers.' Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris criticized Lieber for insisting on fare hikes while dismissing other budget solutions. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas opposed making her constituents pay more. Lieber expressed concern about free buses, preferring targeted affordability programs. The hearing highlighted a sharp divide: lawmakers want to protect riders; the MTA wants stable funding. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'ensure that all work associated with the resurfacing of any street is finalized within 2 weeks from the start of work.' Council Member Diana I.
