Thirty seriously hurt. Over 2,600 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are lives ended or broken on the streets of <a href=/neighborhood/qn0501/>Maspeth</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/qn0502/>Ridgewood</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/qn0503/>Glendale</a>, and <a href=/neighborhood/qn0504/>Middle Village</a>. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just this spring, a cyclist was killed on Juniper Boulevard North. A truck turned right. The man on the bike was crushed, ejected, and died at the scene. He wore a helmet. It did not matter. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>.</p><p>In February, a 47-year-old cyclist was killed on Maurice Avenue. A box truck and an SUV. The man was thrown from his bike. He did not get up. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p><strong>Children, elders, workers, and riders.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five people died. Twelve were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Seventy-three children were hurt. Two people in their thirties did not make it home. The pain does not fade. &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said Jacqueline Cox</a>, after a bus jumped the curb and slammed into a pole, injuring seven.</p><p>On the same crash, a mother said, &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said Samantha Hart</a>. But caution is not enough. The street does not forgive.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator <a href=/senate-district/12/>Michael Gianaris</a> co-sponsored and voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/28/>Andrew Hevesi</a> co-sponsored a similar bill. These are steps, not solutions. The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it yet.</p><p><strong>The carnage continues.</strong> Trucks, SUVs, and cars do most of the killing. The city talks about safety. The bodies keep coming.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside the car. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On August 23, 2024, a group of New York State legislators—Assembly Members Phil Steck and Andrew Hevesi, State Senator Julia Salazar, and former Assembly Member Dick Gottfried—filed a legal brief against Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing. The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger meets concrete.</p><p class=mb3>On August 23, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a project to install protected bike lanes and new sidewalks along Cypress Avenue, connecting to Ridgewood Reservoir. The plan, presented to Queens Community Board 5 in June, calls for a two-way cycle path protected by jersey barriers and sidewalk expansions between Cooper Avenue and Cypress Hills Street. The matter summary states: 'Protected bike lanes and built-out sidewalks are coming to Cypress Avenue to provide a safe connection to Highland Park.' Council Member Bob Holden, usually a cycling skeptic, supports the project. His spokesperson said, 'This particular lane benefits those biking to and from the Ridgewood Reservoir and addresses a broader quality of life issue along Cypress Avenue.' Advocates like Bree Mobley of Ridgewood Riders back the plan, citing the area's crash history—166 crashes, 99 injuries in three years. The project targets a corridor marked by high injury and death rates, aiming to shield vulnerable road users from relentless traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
