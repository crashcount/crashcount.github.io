He died where he fell. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>&ldquo;The bicyclist was an adult male who was pronounced dead at the scene.&rdquo;</a> No arrests.

A Yamaha motorcycle struck her in the dark hours before dawn. She died at Jamaica Hospital. The rider stayed. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>said, &ldquo;At this time there are no arrests and the investigation remains ongoing.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last year, four people died on these streets.

The city built new bike lanes, redesigned intersections, but the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p>No local leader has stood at these corners and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has promised a timeline. No one has faced the families. The silence is heavy.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The bill follows a surge in deadly e-bike crashes—23 deaths last year, up from nine in 2022. The city’s new campaign, 'get smart before you start,' aims to educate riders on safe operation. Rajkumar’s bill drew immediate opposition from delivery workers. Gustavo Ajche of Los Deliveristas Unidos said, 'We're deeply disappointed to see local and state leaders introduce legislation that would put the burden of penalty on delivery workers rather than trying to regulate the app companies.'

The matter summary states: 'State lawmakers proposed spending $90 million this year to improve bus service frequency and expand the scope of the MTA's free bus pilot.' The proposal, supported by Sen.

Michael Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, seek $90 million for increased bus service and 15 more free bus routes. These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The proposals now enter negotiations with Governor Hochul.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Private owners are off the hook.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0221-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on February 28, 2024. The bill states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the parks department to repair damage caused by trees owned by the city of New York.' Council Members James F. Gennaro (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and Inna Vernikov back the measure. Their bill requires the Parks Department to repair sidewalks damaged by city-owned trees, removing the burden from homeowners of one-, two-, or three-family homes. Owners must notify the city if tree roots break the walk. If the damage is not tree-related, owners still have ninety days to fix it. The bill aims to clarify responsibility and ensure city action on hazards caused by its own trees.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill's title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the use of a vehicle to reserve a parking space and prohibiting the continuous parking of a vehicle in the same location for more than five consecutive days.' Holden sponsored the measure, which was referred to committee the same day. The bill would make it illegal to use a car to hold a parking spot and would bar leaving a car in one spot for more than five days. The Department of Transportation must alert drivers and stakeholders to these new rules. The bill has not yet come to a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It was introduced on February 28, 2024, and laid over in committee on April 28, 2025.

Council Members Kamillah Hanks (primary sponsor), Oswald Feliz, Robert F. Holden, Farah N. Louis, Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, Mercedes Narcisse, and Amanda Farías co-sponsored. The bill would force the NYPD to run tow pounds with enough space to tow cars at a rate that deters illegal conduct. It also requires public reports on tow pound capacity and towing in response to traffic violations. The committee has not advanced the bill. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting certain commercial establishments from parking vehicles on city streets,' cracks down on auto body shops, mechanics, car rental businesses, and gas stations that use public streets for business parking. Civil penalties range from $250 to $400 per day, with impoundment for repeat violations. The bill excludes car dealerships and carsharing organizations. Council Members Nantasha M. Williams (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Erik D. Bottcher, and Vickie Paladino back the measure. The law aims to reclaim curb space, but the threat to pedestrians and cyclists from double-parked and idling vehicles persists.
