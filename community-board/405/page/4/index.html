Same ending.</p><ul><li>A box truck turned right at 80th Street and Juniper Blvd North. It struck a 54‑year‑old on a bicycle. He died. Police logged “Traffic Control Disregarded.” The trucker was injured. The record is cold and plain: one dead cyclist, one turning truck. The city file is here: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4807280</a>.</li><li>On Maurice Avenue, a truck going straight hit a 47‑year‑old on a bike. The man died. The form lists “Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way” and “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4705063</a>.</li><li>Motorcycles keep paying the price on local highways: a 26‑year‑old on the LIE, dead; a 39‑year‑old at Eliot Ave and 69th St, dead; a 39‑year‑old on the Jackie Robinson Parkway, dead.

No mercy in the fields of numbers.</p><p>Heavy machines, soft targets</p><ul><li>Trucks and buses loom large in the harm to people on foot. In this district’s pedestrian injuries, trucks caused 19 cases, with three deaths, while SUVs and cars injured far more people overall. The split is here: <a href=#>PeriodStats vehicle rollup</a> and causes of pedestrian injuries by vehicle type in the same file.</li><li>Bicyclists are not spared. Four cyclists are dead in the period. 263 were hurt. Pedestrians: six dead, 408 hurt. The city’s rollup puts it in black and white in the small‑area file.</li><li>Two corridors stand out for carnage: the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Long Island Expressway</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Jackie Robinson Parkway</a>. CB5 also lists <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Maurice Avenue</a> among the deadliest local streets.</li></ul><p>The clock tells on us</p><ul><li>Death peaks cluster late afternoon into evening. The small‑area data shows deaths spiking at 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and again near 10–11 p.m. See the hourly table in the CB5 analysis.</li><li>“Failure to Yield” and distraction appear on fatal bike cases here. “Unsafe speed” barely shows in forms, but the harm does not care about checkboxes.</li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>80th Street at Juniper Blvd North. A right‑turning box truck killed a cyclist. Harden the turn. Daylight the corner. Give a leading pedestrian and bike interval. The fatal file: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4807280</a>.</li><li>Maurice Avenue. A truck driver failed to yield and struck a cyclist. Build protected bike lanes and a protected intersection. Freight keeps moving; people should live. The fatal file: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4705063</a>.</li><li>Cypress Avenue and the highway edges. Repeat injuries stack up. Cut speeds with narrow lanes, raised crossings, and hardened centerlines. The CB5 list flags <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Cypress Avenue</a> as a top injury site.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>City Hall has the tools. Albany handed over one. Sammy’s Law lets NYC lower the default speed. Our site’s call to action lays it out: drop to 20 mph citywide now. See <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>Repeat speeders drive a lot of the killing. The state bill to force speed limiters on habitual offenders moved in June. Senators, including Michael Gianaris and Joseph Addabbo Jr., voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. Our call to “Stop Super Speeders” spells it out in plain terms: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>The Council moved to strip city parking permits from drivers with obscured plates. Council Member Robert F. Holden co‑sponsors <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1358‑2025</a>, which targets plate tampering that hides speed and red‑light violations.</li></ul><p>The horror keeps pace</p><ul><li>In the last 12 months, five people died on CB5 streets. 945 were hurt. The year‑to‑date death count is up from last year at this point. The CB5 period stats show the rise.</li><li>Top locations by harm: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Long Island Expressway</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Jackie Robinson Parkway</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Maurice Avenue</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Cypress Avenue</a>.</li></ul><p>What breaks the spell is not a speech. It is a wrench and a vote. Slow turns. Protected lanes. Lower limits. Limit the repeat speeders. Then count fewer bodies.</p><p>Bold steps are on the table. Use them. <a href=/take_action/>Act now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The policy, not yet law, would 'integrate the same micromobility devices allowed on NYC streets into parks, while continuing to ban mopeds and other heavy vehicles.' Council Member Barbara Russo-Lennon backs the move. The plan faces debate in committee and public hearings.

Fewer cars, safer streets for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2025, the Queens bus network redesign launched, marking the first major overhaul since the 1950s. The event, covered by AMNY, saw new routes and stops, including changes to the Q12 and Q13. Assembly Member Claire Valdez praised the redesign, calling buses a 'critical lifeline.' Transit advocates split: Riders Alliance applauded the move, while Passengers United warned of harm to vulnerable riders. A safety analyst noted, 'Bus network redesigns that improve transit access can encourage mode shift away from private vehicles, reducing traffic volumes and crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists while supporting street equity.' The redesign aims to shift trips from cars to buses, making streets less deadly for those outside vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Opponents lost. The message is clear: New Yorkers want safer roads. No new laws yet, but the council’s direction is set. Vulnerable road users watch and wait.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2025, New York City held local elections with major implications for street safety. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Fiseku, fleeing police after an attempted burglary, sped through red lights and bike lanes, ultimately hitting Servedio at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. Surveillance captured the chase. The indictment states, 'The defendant allegedly led police on a 10-minute chase through the crowded streets.' Servedio, 36, was returning from a cycling event and had the right of way. Fiseku abandoned his truck and evaded arrest until February. The case highlights the lethal risk posed by reckless drivers and high-speed police pursuits on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
