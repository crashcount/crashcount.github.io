The clash exposes deep rifts over city streets and who pays.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2025, Queens Councilman Robert F. Holden publicly criticized Governor Kathy Hochul’s stance on congestion pricing. The event, covered by nypost.com, highlighted Hochul’s past as an anti-toll 'pioneer' in upstate New York, where she fought toll hikes and removal of toll booths. The article quotes Holden: 'She knows the congestion scam tax is bad for New York—she’s admitted as much before—but, as always, her decisions are purely political, not based on what’s right for the people.' Holden’s opposition aligns with critics who say Hochul’s support for the $9 congestion fee contradicts her earlier positions. The matter underscores ongoing council debates over transportation policy and the cost burden on New Yorkers. No direct safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Surveillance footage showed the Mercedes 'barreled through an East Elmhurst intersection' at 4:15 a.m. Diaz, headed to work at LaGuardia, died at the scene. Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail.

The event, held at Sunnyside Community Services, featured Council Member Julie Won (District 26) and other local officials. The panel condemned the rollback of protections for immigrants and the firing of NLRB board member Gwynne A. Wilcox. Velázquez declared, 'We’ll see him in court,' after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revoked federal approval for congestion pricing. She pledged to fight budget cuts targeting vulnerable communities and criticized tax breaks for the wealthy. Julie Won joined the call for grassroots activism.

The matter summary states the program was called 'a slap in the face to working-class Americans and small business owners.' Council Member Robert F.
