He died where he fell. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>&ldquo;The bicyclist was an adult male who was pronounced dead at the scene.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No answers. Just a sheet on the road and a family left behind.</p><p>A 23-year-old woman, Breanna Henderson, crossing Myrtle Avenue at Woodhaven Boulevard. A Yamaha motorcycle struck her in the dark hours before dawn. She died at Jamaica Hospital. The rider stayed. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>said, &ldquo;At this time there are no arrests and the investigation remains ongoing.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last year, four people died on these streets.

The city built new bike lanes, redesigned intersections, but the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p>No local leader has stood at these corners and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has promised a timeline. No one has faced the families. The silence is heavy.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The matter title: 'New Yorkers rally in Midtown to combat “lawless” e-bike riding in NYC.' Holden supports both city and state versions, stating, 'We need the state DMV to issue license plates for e-bikes.' Rajkumar declared, 'We will usher in a new era free of e-bikes blasting through red lights.' The bill is named for Priscilla Loke, killed by an e-bike in 2023.

The bill sits with the Senate, awaiting committee action. Its matter title reads: 'Establishes a bicycle and electric scooter operator's safety manual; provides for the issuance of a license...; requires liability insurance for electric scooters in cities having a population of one million or more.' Primary sponsor Luis R. Sepúlveda (District 32) and co-sponsor Joseph P. Addabbo Jr. (District 15) back the measure. S 5801 would require e-scooter riders in New York City to pass a safety manual, obtain a license, and buy insurance. It also bans sales to unlicensed, uninsured buyers.
