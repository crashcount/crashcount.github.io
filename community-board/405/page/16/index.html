City Hall offered no answers. Delivery workers wait. Council Member Powers grows impatient. Advocates warn registration could hurt cycling. The city stalls. Streets stay dangerous for riders and walkers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 2, 2024, Mayor Adams faced questions about Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar's bill to require e-bike registration and the city’s delay in launching a mandated battery swap program. The mayor called both topics 'off topic' at a press conference. City Hall later said it is reviewing the Rajkumar bill and that the Department of Transportation would oversee the battery swap program, but provided no timeline. The bill, based on disputed injury statistics, has drawn criticism from street safety advocates who argue registration would suppress cycling and sustainable transit. Local Law 131, sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers, requires the battery swap program, but the city has not acted. Powers voiced frustration, noting the Council plans to allocate $3 million for the program. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as city action stalls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, Mitchell Roderick, remained at the scene but faced no charges. Council Member Robert Holden demanded the Department of Transportation evaluate the intersection, echoing the matter’s summary: 'Another truck driver has killed another pedestrian and has not been charged for the crash, despite having made an illegal turn.' The intersection saw 10 crashes and 16 injuries in four years. DEP drivers caused 269 crashes last year, up 25 percent. The agency’s record is worsening.

Michael Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, seek $90 million for increased bus service and 15 more free bus routes. These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The proposals now enter negotiations with Governor Hochul.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both drivers suffered injuries including fractures and whiplash. Police cite following too closely and driver distraction as key factors in the crash.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred at 8:30 AM on Jackie Robinson Parkway in Queens. A 45-year-old male driver of a 2004 Honda SUV, who was unlicensed, collided with the rear bumper of a 2017 Nissan sedan driven by a 27-year-old licensed male. Both drivers were injured; the SUV driver sustained a fractured shoulder and upper arm, while the sedan driver suffered whiplash affecting his entire body. The report identifies 'Following Too Closely' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors for the SUV driver. The SUV's center front end impacted the sedan's right rear bumper as both vehicles traveled eastbound. Neither occupant was ejected, and both were conscious at the scene. The crash highlights driver errors involving unsafe following distance and distraction, without any noted victim fault.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
