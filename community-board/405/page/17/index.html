He died where he fell. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>&ldquo;The bicyclist was an adult male who was pronounced dead at the scene.&rdquo;</a> No arrests.

A Yamaha motorcycle struck her in the dark hours before dawn. She died at Jamaica Hospital. The rider stayed. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>said, &ldquo;At this time there are no arrests and the investigation remains ongoing.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last year, four people died on these streets.

The city built new bike lanes, redesigned intersections, but the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p>No local leader has stood at these corners and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has promised a timeline. No one has faced the families. The silence is heavy.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The resolution, introduced December 20, 2023, and filed at session’s end, urged harsher penalties for purposefully obstructed license plates. The matter’s title: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S.2447/A.5234, which would increase the penalties for purposefully obstructed license plates.' Council Member Robert F. Holden sponsored the measure. The bill aimed to stop drivers from hiding plates to evade speed, red-light, and bus-lane cameras. Obstructed plates let dangerous drivers slip through enforcement, putting vulnerable road users at risk. The resolution supported stronger tools—confiscation, registration suspension, and blocking vehicle IDs—to crack down on this threat.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure stalled at session’s end.</p><p class=mb3>Res 0866-2023, filed by the Committee on Public Safety, called on Albany to pass S.2447/A.5234. The resolution, introduced December 20, 2023, and filed at session’s end, urged harsher penalties for purposefully obstructed license plates. The matter’s title: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S.2447/A.5234, which would increase the penalties for purposefully obstructed license plates.' Council Member Robert F. Holden sponsored the measure. The bill aimed to stop drivers from hiding plates to evade speed, red-light, and bus-lane cameras. Obstructed plates let dangerous drivers slip through enforcement, putting vulnerable road users at risk. The resolution supported stronger tools—confiscation, registration suspension, and blocking vehicle IDs—to crack down on this threat.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the police department to report on the justification for the stop in vehicle encounter reports," demands the NYPD document every vehicle stop. Reports must include the reason for the stop, the level of offense, and demographic details, but no personal identifiers. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and others led the charge. The law aims to expose patterns in police stops and holds officers to account. Reports go online, open to all.
