Thirty seriously injured.</strong> Over 2,600 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars the rest of us cannot see.</p><p>Just this spring, a cyclist was crushed by a truck on Maurice Avenue. The driver failed to yield. The man died from head injuries. He was 47. The data says nothing about his name, only that he is gone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data CrashID 4705063</a>).</p><p>A child cyclist was killed by a turning box truck at Juniper Boulevard North and 80th Street.

The street did not forgive a mistake. The truck did not stop in time.</p><h3 id=the-system-favors-steel-over-flesh>The System Favors Steel Over Flesh</h3><p>Most injuries to pedestrians here come from <strong>cars and trucks</strong>—over 330 cases, including one death. <strong>Trucks and buses</strong> killed three. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds</strong> killed one. <strong>Bikes</strong> caused injuries, but not deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is clear: the heavier the vehicle, the greater the harm.</p><p>No helmet, no crosswalk, no light will save you when a truck turns and you are in its path. The numbers are not accidents. They are the result of choices made by people and by policy.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Some leaders have moved. <strong>Senator Gianaris <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>co-sponsored a bill</a> to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters.</strong> <strong>Assemblymember Hevesi <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">co-sponsored a matching bill</a>.</strong> These are steps. But the carnage continues. Every week brings new names to the list.</p><p>After a bus jumped the curb in Flushing, injuring eight, a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>described the chaos</a>: &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo; The MTA pulled the driver from service. The investigation goes on. The pain remains.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a warning. Every injury is a call. <strong>Contact your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
