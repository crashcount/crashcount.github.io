The bills aimed to stop deadly fires without punishing those who rely on e-bikes to survive.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, the New York City Council advanced a package of lithium-ion battery safety bills. Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing, part of the state budget process, saw Lieber defend Governor Hochul’s proposed 5.5-percent fare increase as a return to regular hikes paused during the pandemic. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and colleagues pushed the 'Fix the MTA' package to freeze fares, boost service, and make buses free. Mamdani argued, 'It is simply not acceptable to put the cost of a basic public good on the backs of working class New Yorkers.' Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris criticized Lieber for insisting on fare hikes while dismissing other budget solutions. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas opposed making her constituents pay more. Lieber expressed concern about free buses, preferring targeted affordability programs. The hearing highlighted a sharp divide: lawmakers want to protect riders; the MTA wants stable funding. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
