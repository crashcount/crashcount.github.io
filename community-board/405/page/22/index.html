The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>said, &ldquo;At this time there are no arrests and the investigation remains ongoing.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last year, four people died on these streets.

The bill aimed to require owners to remove disused or abandoned utility poles, wires, and appurtenances within 60 days, and to act immediately if conditions were dangerous. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the timelines for the removal of abandoned or unsafe utility poles, wires, and appurtenances, and the transfer of appurtenances to newly erected poles.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán sponsored the bill, joined by Kevin C. Riley, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Lincoln Restler, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Amanda Farías, and Robert F. Holden. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The bill’s failure leaves hazardous poles and wires on city streets, a threat to those on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brad Hoylman-Sigal and other NYC officials lobbied the state legislature to pass key transportation and housing bills before the session ends June 9. The centerpiece is 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let New York City set its own speed limits, potentially lowering them to 20 mph. Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted. Mayor Adams’ administration also pushed for affordable housing reforms.

Holden with co-sponsors including Ariola, Riley, Yeger, Restler, Brooks-Powers, Hanks, Borelli, Carr, Kagan, Vernikov, and Paladino. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects. While it aims to protect emergency access, advocates warn it could delay or block street redesigns that save lives for people walking and biking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
