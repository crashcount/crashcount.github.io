Same ending.</p><ul><li>A box truck turned right at 80th Street and Juniper Blvd North. It struck a 54‑year‑old on a bicycle. He died. Police logged “Traffic Control Disregarded.” The trucker was injured. The record is cold and plain: one dead cyclist, one turning truck. The city file is here: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4807280</a>.</li><li>On Maurice Avenue, a truck going straight hit a 47‑year‑old on a bike. The man died. The form lists “Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way” and “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4705063</a>.</li><li>Motorcycles keep paying the price on local highways: a 26‑year‑old on the LIE, dead; a 39‑year‑old at Eliot Ave and 69th St, dead; a 39‑year‑old on the Jackie Robinson Parkway, dead.

No mercy in the fields of numbers.</p><p>Heavy machines, soft targets</p><ul><li>Trucks and buses loom large in the harm to people on foot. In this district’s pedestrian injuries, trucks caused 19 cases, with three deaths, while SUVs and cars injured far more people overall. The split is here: <a href=#>PeriodStats vehicle rollup</a> and causes of pedestrian injuries by vehicle type in the same file.</li><li>Bicyclists are not spared. Four cyclists are dead in the period. 263 were hurt. Pedestrians: six dead, 408 hurt. The city’s rollup puts it in black and white in the small‑area file.</li><li>Two corridors stand out for carnage: the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Long Island Expressway</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Jackie Robinson Parkway</a>. CB5 also lists <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Maurice Avenue</a> among the deadliest local streets.</li></ul><p>The clock tells on us</p><ul><li>Death peaks cluster late afternoon into evening. The small‑area data shows deaths spiking at 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and again near 10–11 p.m. See the hourly table in the CB5 analysis.</li><li>“Failure to Yield” and distraction appear on fatal bike cases here. “Unsafe speed” barely shows in forms, but the harm does not care about checkboxes.</li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>80th Street at Juniper Blvd North. A right‑turning box truck killed a cyclist. Harden the turn. Daylight the corner. Give a leading pedestrian and bike interval. The fatal file: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4807280</a>.</li><li>Maurice Avenue. A truck driver failed to yield and struck a cyclist. Build protected bike lanes and a protected intersection. Freight keeps moving; people should live. The fatal file: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4705063</a>.</li><li>Cypress Avenue and the highway edges. Repeat injuries stack up. Cut speeds with narrow lanes, raised crossings, and hardened centerlines. The CB5 list flags <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Cypress Avenue</a> as a top injury site.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>City Hall has the tools. Albany handed over one. Sammy’s Law lets NYC lower the default speed. Our site’s call to action lays it out: drop to 20 mph citywide now. See <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>Repeat speeders drive a lot of the killing. The state bill to force speed limiters on habitual offenders moved in June. Senators, including Michael Gianaris and Joseph Addabbo Jr., voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. Our call to “Stop Super Speeders” spells it out in plain terms: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>The Council moved to strip city parking permits from drivers with obscured plates. Council Member Robert F. Holden co‑sponsors <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1358‑2025</a>, which targets plate tampering that hides speed and red‑light violations.</li></ul><p>The horror keeps pace</p><ul><li>In the last 12 months, five people died on CB5 streets. 945 were hurt. The year‑to‑date death count is up from last year at this point. The CB5 period stats show the rise.</li><li>Top locations by harm: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Long Island Expressway</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Jackie Robinson Parkway</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Maurice Avenue</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Cypress Avenue</a>.</li></ul><p>What breaks the spell is not a speech. It is a wrench and a vote. Slow turns. Protected lanes. Lower limits. Limit the repeat speeders. Then count fewer bodies.</p><p>Bold steps are on the table. Use them. <a href=/take_action/>Act now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The cyclist was hit by the sedan's left front bumper, ejected from his bike, and suffered crush injuries to his entire body. The report states the cyclist remained conscious after the impact. The crash occurred at 2:00 PM. Police cite 'Passing Too Closely' as the contributing factor, highlighting the sedan driver's failure to provide adequate space for the cyclist. The narrative notes the car 'kept rolling' after the collision. The report also mentions the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is listed after the primary driver error.

No more free rides. Lawmakers gave $12 million for better service, but not enough. Riders lose a lifeline. The city’s poorest feel the blow. Congestion pricing looms. Buses stay crowded, fares return.</p><p class=mb3>On April 21, 2024, the New York State budget ended the MTA’s fare-free bus pilot. The pilot, which began in September 2023, made one bus in each borough free. Lawmakers, including Senator Michael Gianaris, pushed to expand it to 15 lines. The budget did not include this. Instead, $12.3 million was set aside to improve bus frequency, far short of the $45 million needed for expansion. The bill’s summary states, 'The MTA's experiment in fare-less city bus service will soon end after Albany lawmakers did not reauthorize it.' Gianaris pledged to keep fighting for affordable transit. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the pilot 'crucial' for working-class New Yorkers. The MTA’s Janno Lieber criticized the program. No safety analyst reviewed the impact on vulnerable road users. The loss hits riders who depend on buses most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Her own car racks up 10 school-zone speeding tickets. She calls e-bikes a menace, but city data shows cars injure far more. Vulnerable road users face danger from both policy and reckless driving.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar introduced bills A9092 and A9114, aiming to require e-bike registration, insurance, and inspections. The bills are not yet law and have not advanced through committee. Rajkumar, a close ally of Mayor Adams, claims e-bikes are a 'singular threat' and a 'safety hazard,' citing injury numbers that city data does not support. She stated, 'We have to get rid of the e-bike problem.' Despite her focus on e-bikes, a car used by Rajkumar’s office received 10 school-zone speeding tickets in under a year. Her spokesperson denied she drives the car, later confirmed to belong to her chief of staff. Rajkumar declined further comment. The push for e-bike regulation comes as cars continue to inflict the greatest harm on New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The mayor backs a park. Advocates demand transit. Poor residents lose out. Elected officials split. The city risks locking out thousands from jobs and care. The debate rages. No one asks the people.</p><p class=mb3>This op-ed, published April 4, 2024, covers the battle over the unused Rockaway Beach Branch rail line in southeastern Queens. The city, led by Mayor Adams, pushes a park-only project, funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director, argues the plan blocks a vital north-south rail corridor, denying disadvantaged communities access to jobs, education, and healthcare. The op-ed states: 'It is simply irresponsible to build a park on a viable transit right-of-way in the biggest city in America.' State Senators James Sanders, Jr. and Joe Addabbo, Assembly Member Stacey Amato, and Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, JoAnn Ariola, and Bob Holden support studies and funding for the rails-and-trails QueensLink alternative. The mayor’s plan faces criticism for ignoring public input and environmental justice. No safety impact assessment for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City Hall offered no answers. Delivery workers wait. Council Member Powers grows impatient. Advocates warn registration could hurt cycling. The city stalls. Streets stay dangerous for riders and walkers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 2, 2024, Mayor Adams faced questions about Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar's bill to require e-bike registration and the city’s delay in launching a mandated battery swap program. The mayor called both topics 'off topic' at a press conference. City Hall later said it is reviewing the Rajkumar bill and that the Department of Transportation would oversee the battery swap program, but provided no timeline. The bill, based on disputed injury statistics, has drawn criticism from street safety advocates who argue registration would suppress cycling and sustainable transit. Local Law 131, sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers, requires the battery swap program, but the city has not acted. Powers voiced frustration, noting the Council plans to allocate $3 million for the program. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as city action stalls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The moped rider, a 31-year-old man, suffered severe head injuries and was partially ejected, bleeding heavily but conscious. The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, underscoring the moped driver's dangerous actions. The rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, as noted in the report, but these details follow the primary driver errors. The sedan driver, licensed and traveling south, was also involved.
