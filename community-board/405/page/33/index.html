Twelve left with life-changing wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, Queens CB5 has seen 1,267 crashes. Seven hundred forty-four people were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>Just this spring, a cyclist was killed on Juniper Boulevard North. A box truck turned right. The man on the bike was thrown and crushed. He died there, helmet or not. The truck kept rolling. The street stayed open. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> confirms the toll.</p><p>A few months before, a 47-year-old cyclist was killed on Maurice Avenue. An SUV and a truck. The man was ejected, died of crush injuries. No one else died. The road was cleared. The city moved on.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Most of the dead are not behind the wheel.</strong> They walk, they ride, they cross. In three years, cars and SUVs caused 334 pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and buses, 27. Motorcycles and mopeds, 12. Bikes, 9. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not.</p><p>A bus crash in Flushing left eight hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he “misjudged the curb.” Video showed he had fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. “I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said a passenger</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken steps, but the pace is slow.</strong> Senator Gianaris and Assembly Member Hevesi both voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bills to force repeat speeders to slow down</a>. But the default speed limit remains above 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers still roam free. Each delay is a risk paid in blood.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph default. Demand action on repeat speeders. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>Act now.

The editorial slams the plan’s $638 million price tag and attacks its supporters. No mention of safety. The fight is about money, not lives on the street.</p><p class=mb3>On December 16, 2022, an editorial targeted State Senator Michael Gianaris (District 12) for supporting a proposal to make all New York City buses free by 2026. The piece, titled 'Sen. Gianaris’ latest ‘bust the MTA’ budget idiocy,' appeared in the New York Post. It claims the plan would add $638 million a year to the MTA’s deficits and criticizes the idea as reckless. Gianaris, along with Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, is called out for joining the push. The editorial’s focus is fiscal: 'making all city buses free by 2026... would add an estimated $638 million a year to the MTA’s multi-billion dollar deficits.' There is no assessment of how this policy would affect vulnerable road users. The debate here is about budgets, not street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, part of the larger Fix The MTA Package, would phase in free local and Select Bus Service, increase bus frequency by 20%, freeze fares, and expand permanent bus lane camera enforcement. Funding would rise from $200 million in 2023 to $638 million in 2026, with $488 million yearly for more buses and $300 million annually for frequent subways. Mamdani called the proposal 'urgent and necessary,' stressing that 'seniors, working class New Yorkers, people who use the bus the most are able to do so without fear of being priced out.' Gianaris said, 'incrementalism...is not working.' The lawmakers urge bold action to ensure public transit is accessible, affordable, and excellent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
