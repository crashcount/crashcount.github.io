A 52-year-old male bicyclist was partially ejected after being struck in the center back end by a 2021 Toyota sedan traveling westbound. The bicyclist sustained contusions and injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot, classified as injury severity level 3. The sedan driver, also male and licensed in New York, was traveling straight ahead and impacted the bicyclist's rear. The report explicitly lists "Following Too Closely" as a contributing factor, indicating the sedan driver failed to maintain a safe distance behind the bicyclist. No safety equipment was noted for the bicyclist, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The sedan sustained no damage despite the impact. This collision highlights the dangers posed by driver inattention to spacing behind vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
