The debate: cost, service, and public space.</p><p class=mb3>Bill: Fare-free bus pilot, led by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, reported July 2, 2025, by New York Magazine - Curbed. The pilot ran for one year, costing $15 million, with increased ridership and fewer assaults on drivers. Mamdani supports expanding bus lanes and meeting Streets Master Plan mandates. State Senator Michael Gianaris backed the pilot, calling the cost manageable. Experts warn of service tradeoffs. The safety analyst notes: increased ridership signals a shift from cars, boosting safety for pedestrians and cyclists through safety in numbers and less vehicle traffic. Expansion remains debated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by AMNY, saw new routes and stops, including changes to the Q12 and Q13. Assembly Member Claire Valdez praised the redesign, calling buses a 'critical lifeline.' Transit advocates split: Riders Alliance applauded the move, while Passengers United warned of harm to vulnerable riders. A safety analyst noted, 'Bus network redesigns that improve transit access can encourage mode shift away from private vehicles, reducing traffic volumes and crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists while supporting street equity.' The redesign aims to shift trips from cars to buses, making streets less deadly for those outside vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
