The driver did not stop. Police said, <strong>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>NY Daily News</a>). The body was found in the street. The driver is still out there.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> on the streets of Brooklyn CB3. <strong>Sixteen more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Nine hundred were hurt. The numbers do not slow. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers—none are spared.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-is-the-policy>The Pattern Is the Policy</h2><p>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and trucks. SUVs alone killed seven. Trucks and buses killed two more. The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue last week. The barrier is gone.

He also co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. Assembly Member Stefani Zinerman questioned the safety benefits of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The city’s actions speak louder: the lane is gone.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand the return of protected bike lanes. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not delay.
