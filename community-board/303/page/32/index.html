A 79-year-old woman, crossing with the light, is crushed by an SUV at Herkimer and New York. A 68-year-old woman, struck by a Jeep on Flushing Avenue, never makes it across. The city counts the bodies. The drivers keep moving.</p><p>SUVs kill more than anything else here. <strong>Six deaths</strong> and <strong>six serious injuries</strong> from cars and trucks in the last three years. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they do not kill like steel and speed do. The street is not safe for anyone who walks.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-evasion>Leadership: Action and Evasion</h3><p>Local leaders talk of safety. But when the Bedford Avenue bike lane was ripped out, the city called it a response to &ldquo;community concerns.&rdquo; Council Member Lincoln Restler called it what it was: <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>&ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.&rdquo;</a> The lawsuits came fast. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t act now, people are going to die. New York City, we&rsquo;ll see you in court,&rdquo;</a> said one lawyer. The city did not wait for the bodies to cool before making the street more dangerous.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that does not fade after the cameras leave. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

John Liu backs maintaining cameras but won’t commit to S5602. Some City Council members demand that camera revenue fund local road improvements. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried doubts the Council will send the required home rule message in time, while Assembly Member William Magnarelli promises to advance the bill if they do.
