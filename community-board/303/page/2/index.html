The lane remains incomplete, with 'unsignalized intersections, incomplete lane markings, a dangerously designed right-of-way, and an overall lack of proper maintenance.' Trucks block crossings, and drivers stop in bike paths. DOT has not added the route to the official bike map, citing safety concerns.

Over 200 signed a pledge after Mayor Adams decided to strip three blocks of protection, despite city data showing the lanes made the street 'dramatically safer.' The move follows a court ruling allowing the change. City Hall claims the redesign addresses 'serious safety concerns.' Legal precedent (Turturro v. City of New York) could hold the city liable for knowingly making streets less safe.
