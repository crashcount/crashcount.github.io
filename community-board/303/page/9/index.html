An SUV driver guns the engine. She is struck, dragged, and left dying in the street. Her name was Tiffany Cifuni. She was pregnant. Her husband <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>said</a>, &ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same.&rdquo;</p><p>In the last twelve months, three people have been killed on the streets of Brooklyn CB3. Eleven more suffered serious injuries. In total, 715 people were hurt in 1,228 crashes. These are not numbers. They are lives, broken and ended.</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h2><p>SUVs are the main weapon. In this district, SUVs and cars caused six deaths and 122 moderate or serious injuries to pedestrians since 2022. Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes injured ten. The violence is relentless. It does not care about age. Children, elders, parents—no one is spared.</p><p>A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/brooklyn-bed-stuy-fatal-hit-run-woman-gets-out-of-car/>described</a> the aftermath on Van Buren: &ldquo;They dragged her like to the middle of the street, and then they turned wrong up Lafayette and she was just left there.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can act. But the limit remains unchanged. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each delay is another risk, another family shattered.</p><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They say, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; But the bodies keep coming. The silence after each death is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, someone else pays. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people before cars.</p><p>Do not wait for another family to be broken. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
