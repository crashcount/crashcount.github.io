The driver did not stop. Police said, <strong>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>NY Daily News</a>). The body was found in the street. The driver is still out there.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> on the streets of Brooklyn CB3. <strong>Sixteen more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Nine hundred were hurt. The numbers do not slow. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers—none are spared.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-is-the-policy>The Pattern Is the Policy</h2><p>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and trucks. SUVs alone killed seven. Trucks and buses killed two more. The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue last week. The barrier is gone. The danger is not (<a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/07/31/city-begins-removing-stretch-of-bedford-avenue-s-protected-bike-lane>NY1</a>).</p><p>Council Member Chi Ossé called the delay of the protected lane &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and demanded action: <strong>&ldquo;The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/02/council-member-chi-osse-blasts-dot-for-delaying-and-maybe-killing-bedford-ave-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. He also co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. Assembly Member Stefani Zinerman questioned the safety benefits of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The city’s actions speak louder: the lane is gone.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand the return of protected bike lanes. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not delay.

Epps, unlicensed, "blew a stop sign" and struck a school bus, killing his passenger, Imani Vance, and injuring the bus driver. The article quotes Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez: "The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant's reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds." Epps left the scene, tried to escape in an Uber, and was arrested after fleeing on foot. The crash was one of three fatal Brooklyn incidents that weekend. City data cited in the article shows ongoing danger: at least 15 killed in Kings County so far this year, with thousands injured, often due to driver inattention and failure to yield.

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
