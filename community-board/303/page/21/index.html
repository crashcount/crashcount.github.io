The driver did not stop. Police said, <strong>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>NY Daily News</a>). The body was found in the street. The driver is still out there.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> on the streets of Brooklyn CB3. <strong>Sixteen more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Nine hundred were hurt. The numbers do not slow. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers—none are spared.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-is-the-policy>The Pattern Is the Policy</h2><p>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and trucks. SUVs alone killed seven. Trucks and buses killed two more. The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue last week. The barrier is gone. The danger is not (<a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/07/31/city-begins-removing-stretch-of-bedford-avenue-s-protected-bike-lane>NY1</a>).</p><p>Council Member Chi Ossé called the delay of the protected lane &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and demanded action: <strong>&ldquo;The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/02/council-member-chi-osse-blasts-dot-for-delaying-and-maybe-killing-bedford-ave-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. He also co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. Assembly Member Stefani Zinerman questioned the safety benefits of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The city’s actions speak louder: the lane is gone.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand the return of protected bike lanes. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not delay.

The report states both vehicles faced east when the dump truck 'scraped a parked ambulance.' Inside the ambulance, a 39-year-old man suffered an arm amputation. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Passing Too Closely' as contributing factors, highlighting clear driver error. The narrative notes, 'Steel shrieked. A 39-year-old man inside lost part of his arm. Blood smeared the door.' The man was not wearing a seatbelt, but the report attributes the crash to the dump truck driver’s actions. No evidence in the report suggests the victim’s behavior contributed to the collision. The impact left one man permanently injured, underscoring the dangers posed by inattentive driving and large vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
