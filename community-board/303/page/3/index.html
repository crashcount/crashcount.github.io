She never makes it home. The driver who hit her does not stop. She is dragged under the wheels, left dying in the street. Her name was Tiffany Cifuni. She was 32 and pregnant. Her family is left with nothing but grief and the words of her husband: <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/18/us-news/driver-who-mowed-down-mom-to-be-on-way-home-from-beyonce-show-nabbed-in-nyc-officials/>&ldquo;We have been reeling from the day Tiffany was killed. We will not rest until it’s over and we get justice for Tiffany.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people have died</strong> and <strong>ten have suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>698 people have been hurt</strong>. The numbers do not stop. They pile up, year after year. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The old and the young. A 79-year-old woman, crossing with the light, is crushed by an SUV at Herkimer and New York. A 68-year-old woman, struck by a Jeep on Flushing Avenue, never makes it across. The city counts the bodies. The drivers keep moving.</p><p>SUVs kill more than anything else here. <strong>Six deaths</strong> and <strong>six serious injuries</strong> from cars and trucks in the last three years. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they do not kill like steel and speed do. The street is not safe for anyone who walks.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-evasion>Leadership: Action and Evasion</h3><p>Local leaders talk of safety. But when the Bedford Avenue bike lane was ripped out, the city called it a response to &ldquo;community concerns.&rdquo; Council Member Lincoln Restler called it what it was: <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>&ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.&rdquo;</a> The lawsuits came fast. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t act now, people are going to die. New York City, we&rsquo;ll see you in court,&rdquo;</a> said one lawyer. The city did not wait for the bodies to cool before making the street more dangerous.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that does not fade after the cameras leave. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article states, “An elderly man was mowed down and killed by a hit-and-run driver in Brooklyn on May 10, just seconds after the same driver smashed into a nearby vehicle.” The driver first collided with a 2023 Chevrolet Malibu, then continued on and struck Maxwell near Sutter Ave. and Osborn St. The Malibu’s occupants were uninjured and remained at the scene. The driver who killed Maxwell fled and remains unidentified. The NYPD Highway District collision investigation squad is investigating. No arrests have been made.

The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving.

The chase ended in blood and broken glass on Brooklyn streets.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on April 30, 2025, that a New York City police officer shot and killed a driver near the Belt Parkway in Brooklyn. Police identified a stolen Porsche, attempted a traffic stop, and set up a roadblock after the car evaded officers. According to the article, "Police say that officer fired one shot, striking the driver." The driver then crashed into an NYPD vehicle and later died at the hospital. A passenger was taken into custody. The incident drew a large police response, with one witness describing, "30 cops, oh my god, 40 cops, that's insane." The report highlights high-speed movement, a roadblock, and the use of deadly force. No officers were struck, but the event underscores risks in police pursuits and the dangers posed by fleeing vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Change comes after loss and pressure.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on April 28, 2025, that the city will close a dangerous Bushwick intersection after a fatal crash killed motorcyclist Philippe Haussmann. The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced April 24, 2025, it urges the State Legislature and Governor to ban police courtesy cards. The resolution states: 'prohibiting the issuance of police courtesy cards.' Council Members Chi A. Ossé (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, and Tiffany Cabán back the measure. The cards, handed out by NYPD union members, let friends and relatives skirt penalties for traffic violations. The practice breeds unequal enforcement. A 2024 lawsuit exposed how officers faced pressure to honor these cards, even after a $175,000 city settlement. The bill demands an end to this shadow system. It seeks one law for all, no matter who you know.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
