The rider was ejected and suffered fatal head trauma. The report states, 'Signal ignored. Scooter crushed. Blood pooled as dawn crept over broken glass and silence.' The rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary cause listed was the failure to obey traffic control. The motorscooter was demolished.
