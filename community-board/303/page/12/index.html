The driver did not stop. Police said, <strong>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>NY Daily News</a>). The body was found in the street. The driver is still out there.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> on the streets of Brooklyn CB3. <strong>Sixteen more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Nine hundred were hurt. The numbers do not slow. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers—none are spared.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-is-the-policy>The Pattern Is the Policy</h2><p>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and trucks. SUVs alone killed seven. Trucks and buses killed two more. The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue last week. The barrier is gone. The danger is not (<a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/07/31/city-begins-removing-stretch-of-bedford-avenue-s-protected-bike-lane>NY1</a>).</p><p>Council Member Chi Ossé called the delay of the protected lane &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and demanded action: <strong>&ldquo;The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/02/council-member-chi-osse-blasts-dot-for-delaying-and-maybe-killing-bedford-ave-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. He also co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. Assembly Member Stefani Zinerman questioned the safety benefits of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The city’s actions speak louder: the lane is gone.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand the return of protected bike lanes. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not delay.

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
