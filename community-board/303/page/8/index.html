Yarimi, driving with a suspended license, allegedly sped through a red light at 68 mph in a 25-mph zone, striking the family as they crossed Ocean Parkway. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called it 'one of the worst' crashes in his career, stating, 'This defendant's unconscionably dangerous driving wiped out a family.' The crash also injured Saada's young son and five Uber passengers. Yarimi faces multiple felony charges and up to 15 years in prison. The case highlights the deadly risk of high-speed driving and license violations on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...in relation to tracking progress made towards the requirements of the streets master plan.' Council Member Julie Won led sponsorship, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Ayala, and others. The law demands DOT post annual and monthly updates on every project tied to the master plan—listing details, timelines, funding, and setbacks.

The crash pushed the bus into a third, unoccupied vehicle. No children on the bus were harmed.
