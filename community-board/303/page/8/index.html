An SUV crushes her. She dies on Van Buren Street. A 49-year-old man is struck at Lafayette and Bedford. He dies at the intersection. A 79-year-old woman crosses with the signal at Herkimer and New York Avenue. Two SUVs hit her. She dies. In less than three years, 10 people have died and 2,542 have been injured on the streets of Brooklyn CB3. Twenty-four suffered injuries so severe they may never walk right again (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, 55 kids were hurt. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not fade. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse</h3><p>When the city acts, it is often too late or too little. In June, the mayor ordered the removal of the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. He called it a response to &ldquo;community concerns&rdquo; after a child was struck by a cyclist crossing from a double-parked car. &ldquo;After several incidents—including some involving children—on a section of the Bedford Avenue bike lane in Williamsburg, Department of Transportation Commissioner Rodriguez and I listened to community concerns and decided to adjust the current design to better reflect community feedback,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>said Mayor Eric Adams</a>. The city will replace the protected lane with paint. The cars will remain. The danger will remain.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler called it what it is: &ldquo;This is just pure politics. That is not how safety decisions on our streets should be made,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-removal/>he said</a>. The city’s own data showed this stretch was among the most dangerous before the lane. Now, the city rips it out. No plan for the children. No plan for the cyclists. Just paint and hope.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-work-is-not-done>What Comes Next: The Work Is Not Done</h3><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to build real protection, not just lines on the road. It has the power to enforce the law against drivers who double-park and block sightlines.</p><p>But power unused is no power at all. The numbers will keep rising. The bodies will keep falling. Unless you act.</p><p>Call your council member. Demand real protection. Demand lower speeds. Demand that lives come before parking.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, the e-bike driver, a 26-year-old female, was ejected from her vehicle and sustained fractures and dislocations to her knee, lower leg, and foot. The report cites 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as the primary contributing factor, repeated twice, indicating driver error. Additionally, 'Passenger Distraction' was noted as a contributing factor. The e-bike driver was unlicensed and was traveling north, going straight ahead when the crash occurred. The sedan, also traveling north and slowing or stopping, sustained damage to its right side doors, the same point of impact as the e-bike. The report does not attribute fault to the e-bike driver beyond the unlicensed status and focuses on the sedan driver's errors and passenger distraction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
