She never makes it home. The driver who hit her does not stop. She is dragged under the wheels, left dying in the street. Her name was Tiffany Cifuni. She was 32 and pregnant. Her family is left with nothing but grief and the words of her husband: <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/18/us-news/driver-who-mowed-down-mom-to-be-on-way-home-from-beyonce-show-nabbed-in-nyc-officials/>&ldquo;We have been reeling from the day Tiffany was killed. We will not rest until it’s over and we get justice for Tiffany.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people have died</strong> and <strong>ten have suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>698 people have been hurt</strong>. The numbers do not stop. They pile up, year after year. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The old and the young. A 79-year-old woman, crossing with the light, is crushed by an SUV at Herkimer and New York. A 68-year-old woman, struck by a Jeep on Flushing Avenue, never makes it across. The city counts the bodies. The drivers keep moving.</p><p>SUVs kill more than anything else here. <strong>Six deaths</strong> and <strong>six serious injuries</strong> from cars and trucks in the last three years. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they do not kill like steel and speed do. The street is not safe for anyone who walks.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-evasion>Leadership: Action and Evasion</h3><p>Local leaders talk of safety. But when the Bedford Avenue bike lane was ripped out, the city called it a response to &ldquo;community concerns.&rdquo; Council Member Lincoln Restler called it what it was: <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>&ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.&rdquo;</a> The lawsuits came fast. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t act now, people are going to die. New York City, we&rsquo;ll see you in court,&rdquo;</a> said one lawyer. The city did not wait for the bodies to cool before making the street more dangerous.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that does not fade after the cameras leave. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A southbound sedan collided with a southbound bicyclist, impacting the cyclist’s right front quarter panel. The bicyclist, a 35-year-old male, sustained abrasions to his shoulder and upper arm but was conscious and not ejected from his bike. The report identifies driver inattention and failure to yield right-of-way as contributing factors to the crash. The sedan driver’s errors directly led to the collision and injuries. The bicyclist’s safety equipment status is unknown, and no victim behaviors were cited as contributing factors. Vehicle damage was noted on the bike’s right front quarter panel, while the sedan showed no damage. This crash underscores the dangers posed by distracted drivers failing to yield to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring registration of certain bicycles with electric assist,' drew sharp criticism. Ossé cited fears of increased police enforcement and harm to immigrant communities: 'The hearing demonstrated concerns about the bill to be right: Beyond its sweeping consequences for green transit and healthy urbanism, Intro 606 could spell disaster for immigrant communities.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the bill, stating it would burden delivery workers and lacks evidence for improving safety. Civil rights groups warned of racial bias and criminalization.
