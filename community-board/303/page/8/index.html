Prosecutors say Yarimi never braked, ran a red light, and crashed into another car before hitting the family. Saada and two daughters died; her son remains in a coma. Yarimi had a suspended license and $11,000 in unpaid violations, including 21 speed camera and five red light tickets. Brooklyn D.A. Eric Gonzalez called it 'one of the worst collisions I've ever seen on a New York City street.' Yarimi faces manslaughter and assault charges.
