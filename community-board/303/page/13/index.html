The driver did not stop. Police said, <strong>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>NY Daily News</a>). The body was found in the street. The driver is still out there.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> on the streets of Brooklyn CB3. <strong>Sixteen more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Nine hundred were hurt. The numbers do not slow. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers—none are spared.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-is-the-policy>The Pattern Is the Policy</h2><p>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and trucks. SUVs alone killed seven. Trucks and buses killed two more. The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue last week. The barrier is gone.

He also co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. Assembly Member Stefani Zinerman questioned the safety benefits of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The city’s actions speak louder: the lane is gone.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand the return of protected bike lanes. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not delay.

The sedan, making a left turn, hit her with its right front bumper. Limited visibility contributed to the crash. The pedestrian suffered knee and lower leg injuries.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 28-year-old female pedestrian was injured at the intersection of Stuyvesant Ave and Fulton St in Brooklyn at 6:28 PM. The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when a 2022 Toyota sedan, traveling southeast and making a left turn, struck her with the right front bumper. The report notes the driver's error as a failure to yield during the left turn, compounded by 'View Obstructed/Limited,' which impaired the driver's ability to see the pedestrian. The pedestrian sustained contusions and bruises to her knee, lower leg, and foot, with an injury severity rated at 3. The sedan showed no vehicle damage. The report does not list any contributing factors related to the pedestrian's actions or equipment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
