Trump vows to kill the tolls.</p><p class=mb3>On July 2, 2024, state lawmakers, including Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (District 47), discussed reducing the $15 base congestion pricing fee. The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected. No formal safety analysis was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 2024 Nissan sedan, traveling east and stopped in traffic, backed unsafely and collided with a stationary bus. The bus, a 2006 IC model, sustained no damage. The sedan's front center end was damaged. Three occupants in the sedan—a female driver and two male passengers aged 30 and 33—were injured with neck injuries described as whiplash. All occupants were conscious and restrained by lap belts. The police report identifies 'Backing Unsafely' as the contributing factor. No other contributing factors were specified. The bus driver was licensed and uninjured.

Lawmakers and advocates called her move illegal. The MTA faces lost funds, stalled upgrades, and mounting frustration. Transit riders and vulnerable road users are left exposed as car traffic surges unchecked.</p><p class=mb3>On June 10, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul abruptly paused New York City’s congestion pricing program, which was set to begin June 30. The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution. The program’s future remains uncertain, with vulnerable road users facing continued risk from unchecked car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
