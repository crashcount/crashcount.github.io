Assembly Member Nily Rozic voted yes to extend school speed zones, aiming to protect children. State Senator John Liu co-sponsored and voted for the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, targeting repeat reckless drivers. But the carnage continues. Policies come slow. Enforcement is uneven. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—still pay the price.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Ask for more speed cameras. Tell them: every day of delay is another life at risk. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
