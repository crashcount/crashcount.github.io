A 21-year-old passenger, dead on 73rd Avenue. A 73-year-old driver, gone on the Long Island Expressway. Three deaths in the last year. Eight more left with serious injuries. In the same twelve months, 793 people hurt in 1,204 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-that-wont-break>The Pattern That Won’t Break</h3><p>Cars, SUVs, and trucks do most of the damage. In three years, they killed two, left nine with serious injuries, and caused more than a hundred moderate injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction. The street is a machine, and the machine is hungry.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are not safe. A bus hit a cyclist on Union Turnpike this May. A sedan crushed a moped rider on Hillside Avenue in March. A distracted driver struck an infant in February. The details change. The outcome does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They point to new speed limits, intersection redesigns, and more cameras. But the pace is slow. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany lets the law expire and renew, expire and renew. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy. Residents can call their council member. They can demand a 20 mph limit. They can push for more cameras, more street redesigns, more urgency. The machine does not stop itself. Someone must pull the brake.</p><p>Act now. Call your local leaders. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name to join the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates like Alisa McMorris of Mothers Against Drunk Driving called for stronger messaging: 'We want people to make choices before they leave their home.'

Simon and Liu back the measure; city DOT and NYPD leaders joined them. DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' In 2021, 42 people died in drunk driving crashes, up 60 percent from previous years. Officials promise enforcement and education, but their messaging targets drinking, not the act of driving.
