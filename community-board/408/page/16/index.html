The street is a machine, and the machine is hungry.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are not safe. A bus hit a cyclist on Union Turnpike this May.

They point to new speed limits, intersection redesigns, and more cameras. But the pace is slow. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany lets the law expire and renew, expire and renew. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy. Residents can call their council member. They can demand a 20 mph limit. They can push for more cameras, more street redesigns, more urgency.

Council Member Inna Vernikov led as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Farías, Riley, Brannan, and many others. The bill was laid over in committee on December 11, 2024.

The resolution urges the New York State Legislature to 'adopt the same exemptions as FMCSA for approved digital mirror systems with respect to operation in intrastate commerce.' The federal FMCSA allows digital mirror systems in place of traditional mirrors for interstate trucks, citing improved field of vision and blind spot elimination. New York State does not yet allow these systems for trucks operating only within the state. Gennaro’s action aims to align state law with federal safety standards, which the FMCSA says may offer equal or greater safety than old mirrors. The measure remains in committee, awaiting further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Resolution urges Albany to add e-bikes. The measure targets hit-and-runs that leave victims behind. It sits in the Transportation Committee. Lawmakers want accountability when vulnerable road users are struck.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0231-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced March 7, 2024. The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.1679/S.561. The matter title states it aims to 'increase the penalty for leaving the scene of an accident involving an e-scooter and further calling upon the NYS Legislature to include e-bikes in such legislation.' Council Members James F. Gennaro (primary sponsor, District 24) and Gale A. Brewer (co-sponsor, District 6) put their names to the measure. The bill would raise penalties for fleeing e-scooter crashes from a violation to a Class-A misdemeanor, and for more serious cases, to a Class-E felony. The resolution also urges lawmakers to include e-bikes. The council’s action seeks to close loopholes and ensure drivers who harm vulnerable road users face consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution urges the New York State Legislature to 'adopt the same exemptions as FMCSA for approved digital mirror systems with respect to operation in intrastate commerce.' The federal FMCSA allows digital mirror systems in place of traditional mirrors for interstate trucks, citing improved field of vision and blind spot elimination. New York State does not yet allow these systems for trucks operating only within the state. Gennaro’s action aims to align state law with federal safety standards, which the FMCSA says may offer equal or greater safety than old mirrors.

The study could expose the toll.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0113-2024 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 28, 2024, it orders the Department of Transportation to study how last mile delivery facilities batter local streets and communities. The bill summary reads: 'estimating the amount of delivery vehicles arriving at or departing from each facility, and the impact that additional vehicle traffic has on parking, street congestion, vehicle collisions and other traffic incidents.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Alexa Avilés, Shekar Krishnan, Amanda Farías, and over twenty others. The bill was referred to committee on the day it was introduced. No safety analyst has yet weighed in, but the bill’s focus is clear: count the trucks, count the crashes, and show the cost to people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
