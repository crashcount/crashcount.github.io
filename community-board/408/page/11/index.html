A 21-year-old passenger, dead on 73rd Avenue. A 73-year-old driver, gone on the Long Island Expressway. Three deaths in the last year. Eight more left with serious injuries. In the same twelve months, 793 people hurt in 1,204 crashes.

In three years, they killed two, left nine with serious injuries, and caused more than a hundred moderate injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction. The street is a machine, and the machine is hungry.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are not safe. A bus hit a cyclist on Union Turnpike this May. A sedan crushed a moped rider on Hillside Avenue in March. A distracted driver struck an infant in February. The details change. The outcome does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They point to new speed limits, intersection redesigns, and more cameras. But the pace is slow. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany lets the law expire and renew, expire and renew. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy. Residents can call their council member. They can demand a 20 mph limit. They can push for more cameras, more street redesigns, more urgency. The machine does not stop itself. Someone must pull the brake.</p><p>Act now. Call your local leaders. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name to join the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Riders see only risk.</p><p class=mb3>On July 22, 2024, State Senator John Liu, representing District 16 and serving on the Senate's transportation committee, publicly opposed the MTA’s pending redesign of Queens bus routes. In a letter to MTA CEO Janno Lieber, Liu wrote, 'I demand the MTA explain how this plan is overall an increase and expansion of bus service in Queens as opposed to an actually disguised cost reduction measure.' Liu highlighted the planned elimination of the QM3 bus and reductions to the QM5, warning of increased wait times and higher fares for commuters. He argued that rerouting and service cuts would isolate seniors, strand students, and hurt businesses. Liu’s stance: the redesign prioritizes cost-cutting over real improvements. The MTA insists the plan means more and faster service, but Liu and local riders remain unconvinced.

Mayor Adams stalls. Council Members Hudson and Joseph back the plan. Riders wait. Buses crawl. Working-class New Yorkers bear the brunt. The city delays. Streets stay dangerous. Justice deferred.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2024, a coalition of transit advocates and labor unions renewed calls for a Flatbush Avenue bus lane. The campaign, not tied to a specific council bill, has drawn support from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Rita Joseph. The matter, described as a 'no-brainer solution,' highlights slow bus speeds—often under 5 mph—and the urgent need for safer, faster transit. Jolyse Race of Riders Alliance stressed the economic justice at stake, noting bus riders earn half as much as car owners. Mayor Eric Adams has withheld support, citing community engagement and raising concerns about gentrification. The Department of Transportation's plans have stalled under his administration. Healthcare workers and union leaders spoke of missed shifts and unreliable service. Advocates now plan to survey bus riders to show support. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the campaign centers the needs of vulnerable bus riders and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
