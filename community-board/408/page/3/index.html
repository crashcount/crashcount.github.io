The driver, just 25, told investigators he had a green light and &ldquo;misjudged the curb at the bus stop.&rdquo; But after reviewing video, officials now believe he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; said a passenger.</a> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; said another.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps.

State Senator John Liu co-sponsored and voted for the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, targeting repeat reckless drivers. But the carnage continues. Policies come slow. Enforcement is uneven. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—still pay the price.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Ask for more speed cameras. Tell them: every day of delay is another life at risk. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
