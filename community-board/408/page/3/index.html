A 32-year-old woman lost her life on the Long Island Expressway. A 20-year-old cyclist was killed on 164th Street. These are not numbers. These are sons, daughters, neighbors. They are gone.</p><p>On July 11, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb, slamming into a pole. Eight people were hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he had a green light and &ldquo;misjudged the curb at the bus stop.&rdquo; But after reviewing video, officials now believe he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; said a passenger.</a> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; said another.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Assembly Member Nily Rozic voted yes to extend school speed zones, aiming to protect children. State Senator John Liu co-sponsored and voted for the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, targeting repeat reckless drivers. But the carnage continues. Policies come slow. Enforcement is uneven. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—still pay the price.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Ask for more speed cameras. Tell them: every day of delay is another life at risk. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prosecutors say Fiseku, fleeing police after an attempted burglary, sped through red lights and bike lanes, ultimately hitting Servedio at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. Surveillance captured the chase. The indictment states, 'The defendant allegedly led police on a 10-minute chase through the crowded streets.' Servedio, 36, was returning from a cycling event and had the right of way. Fiseku abandoned his truck and evaded arrest until February.
