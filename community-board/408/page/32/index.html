A 32-year-old woman lost her life on the Long Island Expressway. A 20-year-old cyclist was killed on 164th Street. These are not numbers. These are sons, daughters, neighbors. They are gone.</p><p>On July 11, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb, slamming into a pole. Eight people were hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he had a green light and &ldquo;misjudged the curb at the bus stop.&rdquo; But after reviewing video, officials now believe he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; said a passenger.</a> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; said another.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps.

State Senator John Liu co-sponsored and voted for the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, targeting repeat reckless drivers. But the carnage continues. Policies come slow. Enforcement is uneven. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—still pay the price.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Ask for more speed cameras. Tell them: every day of delay is another life at risk. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The driver walked free. The intersection lacked a proper pedestrian signal. Forest Avenue is a killing ground. City leaders have failed to act. Blood stains the street.</p><p class=mb3>On November 21, 2022, Yingqui Liu, age 73, was struck and killed by a turning van at South Avenue and Forest Avenue, Staten Island. No charges were filed against the driver. The intersection, notorious for crashes, lacked a pedestrian signal on the western crosswalk. According to city statistics, Forest Avenue saw 60 crashes and 33 injuries in one year, with three deaths since 2019. Rose Uscianowski of Transportation Alternatives called the killing 'heartbreaking and outrageous,' demanding safe pedestrian and bike access between the Bayonne and Goethals bridges. She said, 'Crossing the street should not be a death sentence.' At least 99 pedestrians have died on city streets this year, making it the second deadliest since Vision Zero began. Forty-two seniors have been killed, three-quarters while walking. The city has not improved this deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
