A 21-year-old passenger, dead on 73rd Avenue. A 73-year-old driver, gone on the Long Island Expressway. Three deaths in the last year. Eight more left with serious injuries. In the same twelve months, 793 people hurt in 1,204 crashes.

In three years, they killed two, left nine with serious injuries, and caused more than a hundred moderate injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction. The street is a machine, and the machine is hungry.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are not safe. A bus hit a cyclist on Union Turnpike this May. A sedan crushed a moped rider on Hillside Avenue in March. A distracted driver struck an infant in February. The details change. The outcome does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They point to new speed limits, intersection redesigns, and more cameras. But the pace is slow. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany lets the law expire and renew, expire and renew. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy. Residents can call their council member. They can demand a 20 mph limit. They can push for more cameras, more street redesigns, more urgency. The machine does not stop itself. Someone must pull the brake.</p><p>Act now. Call your local leaders. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name to join the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The effort, led by the NYPD and Department of Transportation, aims to keep inebriated motorists off the roads. Senator John Liu, representing District 16, publicly supported the crackdown and advocated for lowering the legal blood alcohol limit from .08 to .05. The campaign includes increased police patrols and active speed cameras. The official matter summary states: 'Drunk driving crackdown: NYC launches aggressive enforcement campaign for New Year’s weekend.' Liu said, 'Cracking down on drunk driving, which continues to destroy lives and families, is the right focus as New Year's approaches.' The DOT notes fatalities from drunk driving have risen nearly 30% in recent years. City lawmakers back state legislation to reduce the DWI threshold, aiming to save lives and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, handled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on May 19, 2022, and passed on January 6, 2024. The official title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to notice requirements for certain transportation projects and the repeal of section 19-187 in relation thereto.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of colleagues. The law repeals the old, separate bike lane notice process and folds it into the broader project notice rules. Now, after a set notice period and community feedback, the Department of Transportation can move ahead without delay. This change aims to cut red tape and speed up street redesigns that affect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The greenway remains unfinished.</p><p class=mb3>On November 20, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul vetoed a bill that would have required the state Department of Parks and Recreation and the Office of Mental Health to study expanding the Vanderbilt Motor Parkway greenway into Nassau County. The bill passed both the state Senate and Assembly unanimously. The matter summary called for a study to extend the greenway, which runs parallel to the hazardous Union Turnpike. State Senator John Liu sponsored the bill and vowed to keep pushing for the project, saying, 'I’m confident we’ll get there.' Hochul’s veto cited budget concerns and the risk of 'duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy.' Advocates like Joby Jacob called the veto a blow to years of organizing, noting that people are forced to walk dirt paths where sidewalks should be. The veto blocks progress on a safer route for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
