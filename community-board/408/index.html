A 21-year-old passenger, dead on 73rd Avenue. A 73-year-old driver, gone on the Long Island Expressway. Three deaths in the last year. Eight more left with serious injuries. In the same twelve months, 793 people hurt in 1,204 crashes.

In three years, they killed two, left nine with serious injuries, and caused more than a hundred moderate injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction. The street is a machine, and the machine is hungry.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are not safe. A bus hit a cyclist on Union Turnpike this May. A sedan crushed a moped rider on Hillside Avenue in March. A distracted driver struck an infant in February. The details change. The outcome does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They point to new speed limits, intersection redesigns, and more cameras. But the pace is slow. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany lets the law expire and renew, expire and renew. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a choice made possible by policy. Residents can call their council member. They can demand a 20 mph limit. They can push for more cameras, more street redesigns, more urgency. The machine does not stop itself. Someone must pull the brake.</p><p>Act now. Call your local leaders. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, and streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name to join the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Their votes keep streets exposed. Pedestrians and cyclists lose a shield. Reckless drivers win. The city’s most basic defense—rejected. The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
