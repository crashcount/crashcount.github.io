Twenty-nine maimed for life.</strong> In Manhattan CB3, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, cars, trucks, bikes, and buses have left two thousand people hurt, and the wounds do not heal. Just last year, a bus turned at Avenue D and East 10th. A man was struck. He died at the scene. No warning. No second chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On July 4th, a pickup truck crushed four people on Water Street.

A sedan, a truck, an SUV—each one a weapon in the wrong hands. The numbers are blunt: cars and trucks killed six, motorcycles and mopeds killed none, bikes killed one. The rest were left broken, some forever.</p><p>Residents see the danger. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs.

Another pleaded, &ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Nina Schmidt</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some wait.</strong> Assembly Member Grace Lee and State Senator Brian Kavanagh both voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children at the curb. Kavanagh also voted to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed-limiting tech. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another child to die.
