Twenty-six left with wounds that will not heal. In the last three years, Manhattan CB3 has seen <strong>1,767 people injured</strong> in crashes. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A 31-year-old woman, struck and killed by an SUV on FDR Drive. Three women and a man, crushed by a pickup on Water Street. A 45-year-old man, killed by a bus turning at Avenue D. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage</strong>—twelve deaths, one hundred and seventeen serious or moderate injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds left fourteen more broken. Bikes killed one, injured thirteen. The street does not care what you ride or drive. It only takes.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-punishments>Leadership: Promises and Punishments</h2><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They pass laws. But the blood keeps coming. The NYPD has started to <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>issue criminal summonses to cyclists</a> for low-level violations, forcing them into criminal court. As one report put it, &ldquo;Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>West Side Spirit</a>). The city cracks down on the vulnerable, while drivers who kill often walk away.</p><p>After a driver rammed a pedestrian on Avenue D and fled, police said, &ldquo;no arrests have been made in the ongoing investigation&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/driver-strikes-lower-east-side-pedestrian-06022025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>). The victim survived. Many do not.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to slow the carnage.</strong> They can lower speed limits. They can redesign streets. They can demand real accountability for drivers who kill. But every day they wait, the toll grows.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Do not let another name become a number. The blood in the crosswalk is not washed away by words.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing pavement markings.' Council Member Farah N. Louis led as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Schulman, Banks, Farías, Carr, and Ariola. The law orders DOT to install pavement or temporary markings within five business days after any street resurfacing. If DOT misses the deadline, it must post notices explaining the delay and set a new timeline. DOT must also report yearly on compliance. The law responds to a simple fact: missing markings mean danger for people on foot and bike. With this law, the city moves to close that deadly gap.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with key votes on February 13, 2025. The law, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring street resurfacing coordination,' requires the Department of Transportation to coordinate with agencies and utilities and finish resurfacing within 15 business days after milling. If DOT cannot meet the deadline, it must post a public notice and alert the community board. Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The measure responds to the hazard of prolonged, uneven streets, which put pedestrians, cyclists, and people with mobility devices at risk. The law’s timeline and notice rules take effect in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
