The report states the 19-year-old rider was ejected, landing hard on the asphalt, bleeding severely from his eye but remaining conscious. The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' as the contributing factor in the collision. The rear cyclist's failure to maintain a safe distance led directly to the violent impact, sending the victim forward onto the street. The report describes the point of impact as the right rear bumper of the lead bike and the left front quarter panel of the trailing bike. No information is provided about helmet use or other victim behaviors. The crash highlights the persistent danger when riders are not given adequate space, even on city streets dominated by vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Streets and bridges get counted. Riders’ paths mapped. City must show where safety fails and where it works. Data goes public. No more hiding the truth.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0745-2024, now enacted, came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced April 11, 2024, and became law September 14, 2024, as Local Law 88. The law’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Schulman, Hudson, Restler, and others. The law forces DOT to publish monthly and annual data on bike and micromobility use, plus crash and safety project details. The city must show where riders go, where danger lurks, and what it does to fix it. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it stands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users.
