Nearly two thousand injured.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Manhattan CB3 since 2022. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. In the last year alone, <strong>644 were hurt, 10 seriously, and one lost their life</strong>—all in a patch of city that should be safe for walking home, riding a bike, or crossing to school.</p><p>Just days ago, a vigil was held in Chinatown after a hit-and-run killed a pedestrian and a cyclist at a Canal Street intersection. The crash left the community raw. As one reporter <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/vigil-held-for-pedestrian-cyclist-killed-in-chinatown-hit-and-run/>noted</a>, &ldquo;the crash is raising questions about a bigger safety problem at an intersection of Canal Street.&rdquo;</p><p>On the FDR Drive, the violence does not stop. <strong>Matthew Goicochea, a firefighter, was killed after falling from his motorcycle and being struck by a driver who fled the scene.</strong> Police <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/31-year-old-firefighter-matthew-goicochea-killed-overnight-motorcycle-crash-fdr-drive-fdny-says/17279439/>said</a> &ldquo;he was struck by an unknown vehicle that did not remain on the scene.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed six. Trucks and buses killed another six. Bikes, motorcycles, and mopeds add to the toll. The dead include children, the elderly, and those just trying to get home. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Assembly Member <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Grace Lee</a> and State Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Brian Kavanagh</a> both voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored bills to curb repeat speeders. But the carnage continues. Promises and pilot projects do not slow a speeding car. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not silent.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets built for people, not just cars.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On February 20, 2024, a public forum at Borough of Manhattan Community College brought congestion pricing to the front lines. The event, covered by Charles Komanoff, featured MTA specialists Julia Kite-Laidlaw and Daniel Randell, with State Senator Brian Kavanagh moderating. Council Member Christopher Marte questioned the zone’s boundaries. Assembly Member Deborah Glick demanded action on toll theft. The MTA repeated the need for revenue and warned that exemptions would push more traffic into environmental-justice neighborhoods. The forum’s matter title: 'What Was Left Unsaid to Congestion Pricing Opponents.' The debate exposed deep mistrust and skepticism about government promises.

The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.
