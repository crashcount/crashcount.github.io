Twenty-nine maimed for life.</strong> In Manhattan CB3, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, cars, trucks, bikes, and buses have left two thousand people hurt, and the wounds do not heal. Just last year, a bus turned at Avenue D and East 10th. A man was struck. He died at the scene. No warning. No second chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On July 4th, a pickup truck crushed four people on Water Street.

A sedan, a truck, an SUV—each one a weapon in the wrong hands. The numbers are blunt: cars and trucks killed six, motorcycles and mopeds killed none, bikes killed one. The rest were left broken, some forever.</p><p>Residents see the danger. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said a woman named Nita</a>. Another pleaded, &ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Nina Schmidt</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some wait.</strong> Assembly Member Grace Lee and State Senator Brian Kavanagh both voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children at the curb. Kavanagh also voted to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed-limiting tech. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another child to die.

The pilot program, enabled by a state bill signed December 22, aims to fine illegally overweight trucks. The bill was introduced by State lawmakers Brian Kavanagh and Jo Anne Simon. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, pressed for rapid installation, warning, "There are extremely overweight trucks barreling down the triple cantilever every single day that are a hazard to the health and safety of our community." The matter title states: "Tonnage sensors on the BQE will take a year to set up: DOT." The project is complex, requiring city and state DOT coordination and a 90-day grace period once operational.
