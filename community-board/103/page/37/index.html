Twenty-nine maimed for life.</strong> In Manhattan CB3, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, cars, trucks, bikes, and buses have left two thousand people hurt, and the wounds do not heal. Just last year, a bus turned at Avenue D and East 10th. A man was struck. He died at the scene. No warning. No second chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On July 4th, a pickup truck crushed four people on Water Street.

A sedan, a truck, an SUV—each one a weapon in the wrong hands. The numbers are blunt: cars and trucks killed six, motorcycles and mopeds killed none, bikes killed one. The rest were left broken, some forever.</p><p>Residents see the danger. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said a woman named Nita</a>. Another pleaded, &ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Nina Schmidt</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some wait.</strong> Assembly Member Grace Lee and State Senator Brian Kavanagh both voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children at the curb. Kavanagh also voted to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed-limiting tech. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another child to die.

He acknowledged the time is long overdue to take action in response to the dire conditions of Canal Street. He pledged his support to take action." -- Christopher Marte</p><p class=mb3>On March 9, 2022, a public statement titled 'It’s Time for Immediate Action on Canal Street' spotlighted the deadly imbalance on Canal Street. The Department of Transportation and Council Member Chris Marte faced residents at a design workshop. The matter: 'What is to be done about traffic and safety on Canal Street?' Marte pledged support for urgent changes. The op-ed notes that pedestrians are 65% of users but get as little as 10% of street space. Residents demand widened sidewalks, protected bike lanes, and enforcement against double-parking and crosswalk invasions. The call is clear: shift space from cars to people. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at daily risk. The time for talk is over. The street must change now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The e-bike rider, a 54-year-old man, was ejected and suffered a head injury with severe bleeding. According to the police report, the crash involved 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' and 'Turning Improperly' as contributing factors. The SUV driver’s actions—improper lane use and an unsafe U-turn—created the conditions for the collision.

Overweight trucks pound the BQE. Council Member Restler calls it a daily hazard. Lawmakers push for weigh-in-motion sensors. The city says setup takes a year. Vulnerable road users wait while trucks threaten collapse.</p><p class=mb3>On January 30, 2022, Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) pressed for urgent action on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) weigh-in-motion (WIM) pilot. The bill, sponsored in the state legislature by Brian Kavanagh and Jo Anne Simon, was signed into law on December 22. The measure, described as a 'critical project' by DOT, aims to catch and fine overweight trucks using new sensors. Restler said, 'There are extremely overweight trucks barreling down the triple cantilever every single day that are a hazard to the health and safety of our community.' DOT claims the system will be operational by year’s end, citing technical complexity. The Brooklyn Heights Association and local officials demand faster action. The pilot is the first of its kind in the nation. Until sensors are live, the BQE remains a danger zone for everyone not behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
