Twenty-six left with wounds that will not heal. In the last three years, Manhattan CB3 has seen <strong>1,767 people injured</strong> in crashes. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A 31-year-old woman, struck and killed by an SUV on FDR Drive. Three women and a man, crushed by a pickup on Water Street. A 45-year-old man, killed by a bus turning at Avenue D. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage</strong>—twelve deaths, one hundred and seventeen serious or moderate injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds left fourteen more broken. Bikes killed one, injured thirteen. The street does not care what you ride or drive. It only takes.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-punishments>Leadership: Promises and Punishments</h2><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They pass laws. But the blood keeps coming. The NYPD has started to <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>issue criminal summonses to cyclists</a> for low-level violations, forcing them into criminal court. As one report put it, &ldquo;Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>West Side Spirit</a>). The city cracks down on the vulnerable, while drivers who kill often walk away.</p><p>After a driver rammed a pedestrian on Avenue D and fled, police said, &ldquo;no arrests have been made in the ongoing investigation&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/driver-strikes-lower-east-side-pedestrian-06022025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>). The victim survived. Many do not.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to slow the carnage.</strong> They can lower speed limits. They can redesign streets. They can demand real accountability for drivers who kill. But every day they wait, the toll grows.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Do not let another name become a number. The blood in the crosswalk is not washed away by words.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The chase ended near Dyckman Street when the car slammed into a building and caught fire. The officers 'approached the burning SUV but then left without helping the driver or calling for an ambulance.' They did not report the crash. Both have been suspended while the Force Investigation Division and Attorney General review their actions. The incident follows a February NYPD policy change barring pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' NYPD data shows one in four pursuits last year led to crashes or injuries. The crash exposes the risks of high-speed chases and gaps in police accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
