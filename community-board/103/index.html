Twenty-nine maimed for life.</strong> In Manhattan CB3, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, cars, trucks, bikes, and buses have left two thousand people hurt, and the wounds do not heal. Just last year, a bus turned at Avenue D and East 10th. A man was struck. He died at the scene. No warning. No second chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On July 4th, a pickup truck crushed four people on Water Street.

The city moved on.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Most victims are not drivers.</strong> They are walkers, cyclists, children. A sedan, a truck, an SUV—each one a weapon in the wrong hands. The numbers are blunt: cars and trucks killed six, motorcycles and mopeds killed none, bikes killed one. The rest were left broken, some forever.</p><p>Residents see the danger. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said a woman named Nita</a>. Another pleaded, &ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Nina Schmidt</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some wait.</strong> Assembly Member Grace Lee and State Senator Brian Kavanagh both voted to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children at the curb. Kavanagh also voted to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed-limiting tech. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another child to die.

According to the police report, the contributing factor was “Glare.” The truck’s point of impact was the center front end while the bike was going straight.

The plan is "intended to connect gaps across NYC's bike and pedestrian paths." It names early action corridors and uses $7.25 million in federal funds to write corridor plans by 2028. Construction timelines are missing. Parks Commissioner Iris Rodriguez-Rosa says it maps "strengths and weaknesses." The Midtown Greenway showcase still leaves the East Side gap.

The city failed to keep them safe.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-07-22) reports a Staten Island driver, Autumn Ascencio Romero, faces murder and other charges after killing a cyclist and a pedestrian in Chinatown. Prosecutors say she lost control of a rented car at high speed, striking Kevin Cruickshank and May Kwok. Police found 'an open bottle of tequila in the car’s passenger area' and two pistols in the trunk. Witnesses saw the driver and a passenger try to flee. Romero had been charged in a prior Brooklyn crash involving a suspended license. The case highlights repeated driver offenses and gaps in enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
