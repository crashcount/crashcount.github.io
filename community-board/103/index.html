How Many More Before City Hall Acts?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 31, 2025</p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Manhattan CB3: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 31, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-toll-on-our-streets>The Toll on Our Streets</h2><p><strong>Seventeen dead. Nearly two thousand injured.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Manhattan CB3 since 2022. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>one person died and 646 were hurt</strong>—most of them walking, biking, or just trying to live their lives. The wounds are not abstract. They are broken skulls, crushed chests, faces torn open, and lives ended at the curb.</p><p>Just last week, a 65-year-old man on an e-bike was hit on Second Avenue. The driver fled. Paramedics found the man unconscious, his head split open. &ldquo;They immediately started doing CPR and quickly put him in the ambulance,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/30/hit-and-run-rogue-driver-caught-after-seriously-injuring-cycling-senior-in-heart-of-the-city>a witness said</a>. The driver was unlicensed. He was arrested two hours later, charged with leaving the scene and driving without a license. The street was closed. The red light on the crumpled bike kept blinking in the dark (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a>).</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks kill and maim the most.</strong> Of the deaths and injuries to pedestrians here, most come from sedans, SUVs, and trucks. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes also leave scars, but the steel machines do the worst damage. The violence is steady. It does not care about age. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The city counts the bodies. It does not count the empty chairs.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Christopher Marte called out the city for &ldquo;ongoing neglect&rdquo; after a deadly bridge crash (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/manhattan-bridge-crash-driver-faces-murder-rap-marte-blasts-dot-for-neglect-KB4883851>West Side Spirit</a>). Assembly Member Grace Lee and Senator Brian Kavanagh both voted to extend school speed zones, a move that will help protect children. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><p><strong>Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h2 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras everywhere children walk. Demand that repeat speeders lose their keys. Do not wait for another name on the list. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
