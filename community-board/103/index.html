Twenty-six left with wounds that will not heal. In the last three years, Manhattan CB3 has seen <strong>1,767 people injured</strong> in crashes. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A 31-year-old woman, struck and killed by an SUV on FDR Drive. Three women and a man, crushed by a pickup on Water Street. A 45-year-old man, killed by a bus turning at Avenue D. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage</strong>—twelve deaths, one hundred and seventeen serious or moderate injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds left fourteen more broken. Bikes killed one, injured thirteen. The street does not care what you ride or drive. It only takes.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-punishments>Leadership: Promises and Punishments</h2><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They pass laws. But the blood keeps coming. The NYPD has started to <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>issue criminal summonses to cyclists</a> for low-level violations, forcing them into criminal court. As one report put it, &ldquo;Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>West Side Spirit</a>). The city cracks down on the vulnerable, while drivers who kill often walk away.</p><p>After a driver rammed a pedestrian on Avenue D and fled, police said, &ldquo;no arrests have been made in the ongoing investigation&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/driver-strikes-lower-east-side-pedestrian-06022025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>). The victim survived. Many do not.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to slow the carnage.</strong> They can lower speed limits. They can redesign streets. They can demand real accountability for drivers who kill. But every day they wait, the toll grows.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Do not let another name become a number. The blood in the crosswalk is not washed away by words.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

An illegal electric unicycle hit a cyclist, sending its operator to the hospital in critical but stable condition. The cyclist, Carolyn Backus, was wrongly charged with leaving the scene, though she "remained on scene for about 45 minutes after the crash and waited for paramedics." The Manhattan D.A. dismissed the charge, noting Backus rode a non-motorized bike. The article highlights the risk of high-speed e-vehicles in crowded park zones, where "unpredictable congestion makes it the last place...anyone should be speeding."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users watch and wait.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2025, New York City held local elections with major implications for street safety. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams admits the plan is 'an idea' needing state approval and a lengthy rulemaking process. Critics like Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives call the proposal 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' arguing it unfairly targets cyclists while drivers face lesser consequences for greater harm. Janet Schroeder of the NYC E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the limit will matter without enforcement: 'The 15 mph speed limit does nothing.' The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor infractions.

Residents fear traffic will flood side streets. Bus riders crawl at five miles an hour. Officials tout safety gains from 14th Street. Tension rises between speed, safety, and neighborhood calm.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (2025-06-08) reports that the city proposes restricting cars on 34th Street to create a busway between 3rd and 9th Avenues. Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists demand fair treatment, safety, respect.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 2, 2025, that hundreds of New Yorkers joined a mass ride to protest the NYPD’s intensified enforcement against cyclists. The demonstration, which began at Union Square, challenged new policies issuing criminal summonses for minor cycling offenses. Riders followed traffic laws, highlighting the crackdown’s contradictions. One cyclist, Erin Poland, said the policy 'is not actually protecting cyclists [but] putting them in more danger.' Another, Tara Pham, noted, 'I’ve been hit by vehicles twice... those drivers face no criminal charges.' The article details how police arrested a Citi Bike rider for not moving aside and lacking ID, while drivers who injure vulnerable road users often avoid serious consequences. The piece underscores the disparity in enforcement and questions the effectiveness and fairness of current NYPD tactics.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
