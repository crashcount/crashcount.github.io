She is 95. A cargo van turns left. She does not make it to the other side. Her home health aide survives, but Mayya Gil is gone. The driver is not charged. Her daughter says, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was a very active lady.&rdquo;</a> The street does not care. The city moves on.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 422 were injured</strong> on these streets. Three were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared. One child died. Thirty-nine more were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the people behind them do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed two, left two with serious injuries, and caused 78 moderate injuries. Trucks and buses hurt seven, leaving one with life-changing wounds. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are not blameless, but their toll is smaller. The street is a gauntlet for the old, the young, anyone on foot or two wheels.</p><p>The city counts the bodies. It counts the broken bones. It counts the days until the next crash. But the counting does not stop the dying.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new speed limits, more cameras, and intersection redesigns. But the work is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done so everywhere. Each delay is another risk. Each day without action is another family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><p>Mayya Gil’s family remembers her as a pillar of the community. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was the kindest, most generous person I&rsquo;ve ever met,&rdquo;</a> her granddaughter said. The driver who killed her walked away.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where the old and the young can cross and come home. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when the vehicle, making a left turn, failed to yield right-of-way and turned improperly. The collision caused a head injury and contusion to the pedestrian, who remained conscious. The report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Turning Improperly' as the contributing factors attributed to the driver. The vehicle showed no damage, and the driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally. The pedestrian's crossing with the signal is noted but not cited as a contributing factor.

The bill adds pets to protected victims in traffic law. It hikes fines for drivers who hit animals and flee. Lawmakers push for real consequences when cars strike dogs, cats, and other companions.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0723-2025 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of New York, in relation to requiring bicyclists to wear protective headgear,' would require every cyclist not already mandated by other laws to wear a helmet. Violators face civil penalties up to $50. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Council Members Holden, Vernikov, Narcisse, Moya, Schulman, Louis, Hanks, Brannan, and Zhuang. The bill does not address the root causes of cyclist injuries: reckless drivers, speeding cars, and deadly streets. Instead, it shifts responsibility onto those most at risk, leaving the city’s dangerous roads unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented.
