She is 95. A cargo van turns left. She does not make it to the other side. Her home health aide survives, but Mayya Gil is gone. The driver is not charged. Her daughter says, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was a very active lady.&rdquo;</a> The street does not care. The city moves on.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 422 were injured</strong> on these streets. Three were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared. One child died. Thirty-nine more were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the people behind them do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed two, left two with serious injuries, and caused 78 moderate injuries. Trucks and buses hurt seven, leaving one with life-changing wounds. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are not blameless, but their toll is smaller. The street is a gauntlet for the old, the young, anyone on foot or two wheels.</p><p>The city counts the bodies. It counts the broken bones. It counts the days until the next crash. But the counting does not stop the dying.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new speed limits, more cameras, and intersection redesigns. But the work is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done so everywhere. Each delay is another risk. Each day without action is another family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><p>Mayya Gil’s family remembers her as a pillar of the community. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was the kindest, most generous person I&rsquo;ve ever met,&rdquo;</a> her granddaughter said. The driver who killed her walked away.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where the old and the young can cross and come home. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Hours earlier in Manhattan, a Dodge Charger changed lanes, clipped a street sweeper, spun out, and pinned an officer against his patrol SUV. Surveillance footage showed the Charger 'spinning out of control before hitting the officer.' Witness Abi Aguirre described the chaos: 'It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car.'
