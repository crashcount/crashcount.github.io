She is 95. A cargo van turns left. She does not make it to the other side. Her home health aide survives, but Mayya Gil is gone. The driver is not charged. Her daughter says, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was a very active lady.&rdquo;</a> The street does not care. The city moves on.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 422 were injured</strong> on these streets. Three were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared. One child died. Thirty-nine more were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the people behind them do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed two, left two with serious injuries, and caused 78 moderate injuries. Trucks and buses hurt seven, leaving one with life-changing wounds. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are not blameless, but their toll is smaller. The street is a gauntlet for the old, the young, anyone on foot or two wheels.</p><p>The city counts the bodies. It counts the broken bones. It counts the days until the next crash. But the counting does not stop the dying.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new speed limits, more cameras, and intersection redesigns. But the work is slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done so everywhere. Each delay is another risk. Each day without action is another family waiting for a call that never should come.</p><p>Mayya Gil’s family remembers her as a pillar of the community. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was the kindest, most generous person I&rsquo;ve ever met,&rdquo;</a> her granddaughter said. The driver who killed her walked away.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where the old and the young can cross and come home. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to place temporary priority regulatory signs—like stop or yield—at intersections within one hour of a reported inoperable traffic signal. The matter summary states, 'requiring the placement of temporary priority regulatory signs at intersections within one hour of a report of an inoperable traffic control signal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Julie Won, Kalman Yeger, and Justin L. Brannan sponsored the bill. The session ended with the bill filed, not enacted. Analysts noted that faster signage could 'significantly reduce the risk of pedestrian injury and vehicular collisions at intersections with malfunctioning traffic control signals.' The city’s current two-hour response and 24-hour wait for alternative controls left vulnerable road users exposed.

The matter summary: 'It requires the city to make sure that every intersection on a block where there is a school, has a traffic sign or a stop signal.' Council Members Justin Brannan and Bob Holden, and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, all criticized DOT’s slow pace and reliance on federal MUTCD guidelines. Community Board 14 in Brooklyn faced years of denials before a stop sign appeared. DOT promises compliance, but critics say the agency only acts after tragedy. The law aims to protect children, but bureaucratic inertia keeps danger in the crosswalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, introduced by Inez Barron, requires the Department of Transportation to install traffic control devices at every intersection next to a school by September 30, 2024. Council Member Justin Brannan, representing District 47, called the law a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn't be some huge colossal victory.' The law aims to bypass restrictive federal guidelines that block safety fixes. Council members and residents blasted DOT for slow, arbitrary action and years of denied requests, sometimes only reversed after tragedy. The Adams administration promises to redesign 1,000 more intersections, but families and advocates demand faster, decisive protection for children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would require commercial parking garages to charge the same rate for all light-duty vehicles under 8,500 pounds, including sedans, vans, SUVs, and pickups. Brannan claims the measure fights arbitrary price-gouging, saying, 'The idea is to make it fair for people who choose to drive.' Critics, like StreetsPAC's Eric McClure, argue the bill subsidizes SUV use and endangers city streets, stating, 'We shouldn’t be bending over backwards to further subsidize someone’s choice to drive an SUV or pickup truck in New York City.' Brannan admits the bill needs revision. The bill’s status and committee assignment remain unclear.
