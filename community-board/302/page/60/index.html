An SUV sat stopped in traffic. A sedan drove straight. The right‑rear passenger was crushed. She did not make it. That was 11:04 p.m. on February 28. The city logged it as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4795527</a>.</p><p>Two more riders died on the BQE. One at 9:58 p.m. on May 10. A motorcycle hit the back of a slowing sedan. The rider died at the scene. The state called it <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4812048</a>. Another at 1:57 a.m. on July 3. A 55‑year‑old was ejected.

She was not at an intersection. An SUV going west hit her. She died on May 17. The record is <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4813415</a>.</p><p>In this board, since 2022, <strong>13 people have died</strong> and 2,721 were hurt.

The names repeat in police logs. The pain repeats in families.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-bites>Where the street bites</h3><p>The BQE is the worst line on the map here: 309 injuries and three deaths since 2022. That is the top hotspot, stamped in the data as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>BROOKLYN QUEENS EXPRESSWAY</a>. Tillary Street follows with 58 injuries and four serious injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Fulton Street</a> shows 109 injuries.</p><p>The clock doesn’t help. Injuries stack up in the afternoon. From 1 p.m. through 5 p.m., the files show nine deaths and hundreds hurt, with a spike at 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. The hourly curve is in the board’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>distribution</a>.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hit>Who gets hit</h3><p>People outside cars carry the damage. Pedestrians: 490 injuries, 17 serious, two deaths. Cyclists: 494 injuries, 16 serious. Motorized micromobility adds another 123 injuries and three serious injuries. Cars and SUVs still drive most of the harm to walkers: sedans account for 170 pedestrian injuries; SUVs for 133.

The board’s council member, Lincoln Restler, has pressed bills to keep space clear and kids safer near schools. A resolution he sponsors would let a state bill ticket owners when cameras catch parking rule violations. It aims to stop the crosswalk and bike‑lane blockers that force people into traffic. The text sits in <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Res 1024‑2025</a>. The measure “calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5440.” That is the council’s record.</p><p>He also co‑sponsors a bill to force DOT to install school‑zone safety devices within 60 days of a study. The title is <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>. Another bill he leads would revoke placards for obscured plates. The listings are on the same <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council site</a>.</p><h3 id=what-albany-moved>What Albany moved</h3><p>Speed cameras will stay on through 2030. The governor signed the reauthorization on June 30. “Speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” she said. That’s in the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog report</a>. AMNY covered the same extension and noted the sponsors. Read it here: <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>renewed through 2030</a>.</p><p>In the Senate, lawmakers advanced a bill to clamp repeat speeders with intelligent speed assistance. Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes in committee. So did Senator Andrew Gounardes. The bill is <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. The committee records are linked on that page.</p><h3 id=what-must-change-on-these-blocks>What must change on these blocks</h3><ul><li>Daylight the corners on Fulton, Tillary, and Flatbush. Clear the sightlines that hide people in the crosswalk.</li><li>Harden the turns where drivers cut close. Protect walkers and cyclists at the apexes.</li><li>Target repeat hotspots on the BQE feeders with automated and manual enforcement during the peak injury hours listed above.</li></ul><p>These are small fixes. They keep bones intact.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The cost of delay</h3><p>Police and press keep writing the same lines in other parts of the city. “A driver struck and killed a 47‑year‑old pedestrian… then left the scene,” police said in Bushwick this month. That man was found dead in the road. The driver was gone. Read the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>Daily News</a> and <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Gothamist</a> coverage.</p><p>The pattern is not special. It is routine. It is ours.</p><h3 id=slow-it-down-citywide>Slow it down, citywide</h3><p>Albany renewed cameras. The Council is pushing to clear lanes and speed up school‑zone fixes. The state bill to force speed limiters on repeat offenders is moving. These steps cut risk for people on foot and on bikes. Pair them with a lower default speed limit and targeted fixes at BQE ramps, Fulton, Tillary, and Flatbush. Fewer sirens. Fewer vigils.</p><p>One call helps.

Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Bobby Carroll, would require all new drivers in New York State to complete six hours of professional driving instruction before taking the road test. The bill was announced on March 29, 2022. Gounardes slammed the current rules as too lenient, saying, "For some drivers, the first time they take the wheel [as a licensed driver] they are in sole control of their car." Carroll called the requirement "reasonable." Stephen Walling, president of the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools, said the bill would "go a long way towards keeping all New Yorkers safer on our roads." The NYC Department of Transportation called driver education "crucial" for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users, and is reviewing the proposal. The bill awaits committee action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable lives lost.</p><p class=mb3>On March 25, 2022, Mayor Adams held a press conference on street safety and traffic enforcement policy. The event spotlighted the city’s struggle to control its own traffic laws. Adams slammed state rules that force red light and speed cameras off between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., calling it 'unbelievable.' He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year. The mayor pressed for 24/7 camera operation and renewed NYPD focus. The council and advocates demand Albany act before more lives are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams criticized the law that forces cameras off at 10 p.m., asking, 'Who are we protecting? We're protecting the speeders?' He cited clear data showing cameras cut violations and crashes. State Senator Andrew Gounardes echoed Adams, questioning why lawmakers outside the city control local street safety. Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement has dropped and pledged to prioritize it. Advocates argue enforcement alone is not enough and call for street redesigns to protect pedestrians and cyclists. Traffic deaths remain high, especially when cameras are off.
