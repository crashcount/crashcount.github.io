The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world.

Restler clashed with NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell over the issue. The bill’s status and committee assignment remain unlisted.

The fight for safer streets continues.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 417, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, was discussed at a City Council hearing on April 26, 2023. The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the Council, 'We love Lincoln Restler's bill,' and called the old law 'unnecessarily burdensome.' The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster. Bike advocates and DOT say the change is vital to meet safety targets and reduce cyclist injuries, which drop by over 30 percent where bike lanes are built.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It now covers more area near schools. The NYPD, represented by Director of Legislative Affairs Michael Clarke, opposed the bill, warning of possible assaults and harassment. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said his agency is open to talks after earlier resistance. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, committee chair, voiced concerns about public conflict.

The standoff laid bare a system that protects cars, not people.</p><p class=mb3>On April 24, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on NYPD parking enforcement and related legislation. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg) confronted NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell over widespread illegal parking by police around precincts. Restler cited a study showing 70 of 77 precincts had officers’ cars blocking sidewalks, calling NYPD enforcement 'a joke.' Chell insisted he has led 5,000 inspections and issued 39 command disciplines in four months, but Restler dismissed these efforts as inadequate. Restler used the hearing to highlight his bill allowing citizen reporting of parking infractions, bypassing the broken 311 system. He argued, 'A failure of the NYPD to enforce against this issue over many years makes our streets unsafe. So why not empower citizens to do the work that the NYPD has refused to do?' The hearing exposed deep distrust and the ongoing danger NYPD’s parking practices pose to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The old system kept streets dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Bill S1234, introduced by Senator Andrew Gounardes on April 12, 2023, aims to overhaul New York’s environmental review process. The bill, now before the legislature, would replace the outdated 'level of service' metric—focused on driver delay—with a mandate to reduce total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by 15 percent by 2050. The bill summary states: 'By eliminating the relevance of level of service as a metric and utilizing vehicle miles traveled reduction instead, we can provide a new criteria for determining the significance of transportation impacts.' Gounardes, the bill’s sponsor, argues this shift will cut emissions and promote safer, multimodal streets. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Sara Lind back the measure, calling it a long-overdue update that could finally let safety and climate take priority over car traffic. The bill follows California’s lead and could set a national example.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
