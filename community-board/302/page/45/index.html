Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,300 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue. Each crash is a life ended or broken. Each is a story cut short.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> They killed two people and injured more than 300 on foot. Trucks and buses added to the toll. Bikes and e-bikes hurt dozens, but the deadliest threat rolled on four wheels. The numbers are plain: the street is not safe for the unprotected.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world. She made me a better person, a better man,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>said James Cifuni</a> after his pregnant wife was run down and killed in Brooklyn. &ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same.&rdquo;</p><p>On another street, a bus pinned an 87-year-old man under its wheels. He was just standing near the corner when the driver turned and hit him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Police said officers who responded to the scene discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus at East 12th Street and Avenue Z in Sheepshead Bay around 6:40 p.m.</a></p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every stalled bill, every unprotected crosswalk, every ignored speed limit is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes that do not disappear.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Safety hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 17, 2023, Council Member Rita Joseph (D-Flatbush) introduced a bill to require New York City to build 100 miles of protected bike lanes annually, doubling the current Streets Plan mandate. The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg), would apply from this year through 2028. The matter summary states the bill 'emphasizes the need for more protected bike lanes to make streets safer and increase cycling.' Joseph leads the legislation; Restler supports. The Department of Transportation failed to meet even the lower 30-mile requirement in 2022, building only 26.3 miles. DOT faces staffing shortages and budget gaps. Advocates warn that enforcement and maintenance lag, and that blocked lanes remain a threat. Joseph’s district ranks low in protected bike lane coverage, despite high rates of walking, biking, and transit use. The bill sits before the Council, with DOT reviewing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Doug Gordon called the new version 'silly,' saying it adds hoops and limits scope. Eric McClure said the bill still improves things, but activists argue these changes gut its power.

The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt.
