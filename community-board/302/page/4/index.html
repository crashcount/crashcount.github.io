The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world.

Cyclists keep dying.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee considered S533, a bill to repeal congestion pricing, after a procedural motion by Sen. Jack Martins. Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets. Cyclist deaths keep rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure now returns to the City Planning Commission before a full Council vote. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue rezoning allowing 4,600 new homes passes key NYC Council panels,' covers a 20-block stretch in Crown Heights, Bed-Stuy, and Prospect Heights. Councilmembers Chi Ossé (District 36) and Crystal Hudson support the plan, which includes $215 million for infrastructure, tenant protections, and workforce development. Ossé said, 'We are taking on that challenge' of housing scarcity. The plan funds a comprehensive redesign of Atlantic Avenue, focusing on major intersections and bike infrastructure, plus upgrades to playgrounds and subway access. These changes target systemic street danger, aiming to protect pedestrians and cyclists in a corridor long plagued by crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Lincoln Restler, a strong backer of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, challenged the ballot access of opponent Sabrina Gates, claiming her campaign misled petition signers. A judge ruled Gates had enough valid signatures. The bike lane, built by the Department of Transportation in September, faces fierce opposition from Hasidic residents worried about child safety. At least two children have been injured by cyclists, fueling calls to reroute the lane. Over 3,200 residents signed a petition against it. Cycling advocates and Restler point to a 25% drop in injuries since the lane’s installation. Gates argues more must be done to address community complaints. The court battle centered on ballot signatures, not the lane itself, but the fight underscores deep tensions over street safety and representation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, 'Monday’s Headlines: NYPD Bike Crackdown Edition,' revealed that the crackdown would sweep 14 corridors across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the policy 'incredibly misguided' and 'unacceptable.' MSNBC’s Chris Hayes called it 'outrageous' and warned it targets immigrant delivery cyclists. The New York Civil Liberties Union warned of amplified racially targeted policing. The safety analyst notes: 'Criminalizing common cycling violations places undue burdens on cyclists, discourages cycling, and may reduce mode shift, ultimately undermining safety in numbers and street equity for vulnerable road users.'

Data shows Black drivers face more searches and arrests. NYPD blamed crime patterns. Lawmakers called it an excuse. The city’s history of biased policing loomed large.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2025, the City Council held an oversight hearing on NYPD traffic enforcement and racial bias. Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, "She was arrested Wednesday following a police investigation, and was charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian, and failure to exercise due care, cops said." Martin hit Henriquez while turning left; Henriquez died later that day. The driver remained at the scene. The charges highlight driver error—failure to yield and lack of due care.

Council Member Lincoln Restler leads, joined by Salaam, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Banks, and Brannan. The bill would force drivers with eleven or more points in eighteen months, or six speed/red light camera tickets in a year, to install speed-limiting tech. The Council cites data: 265 killed, 52,949 injured on city streets in 2023. The measure aims to put a brake on reckless driving. The committee has not yet advanced the resolution.
