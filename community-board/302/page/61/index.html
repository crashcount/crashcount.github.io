A Ford Explorer hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>The driver of the Ford Explorer sped off without stopping, stunned witnesses told police.</a></p><p>A week before, a motorcyclist died on the BQE. The driver he hit was unlicensed, driving without a court-ordered ignition lock. Police made an arrest. The dead man’s name was Sean Johnson. He was 27. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bqe-traffic-collision-arrest-05102025/>Police arrested 44-year-old Laura Cordova&mldr; for driving without a license and using a vehicle without ignition interlock.</a></p><p>A woman stepped out of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

They talk about speed cameras and new laws. They say, &ldquo;We understand there is more work to do… one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many, but our administration remains committed to reducing traffic violence as much as any other form of violence.&rdquo; But the streets do not listen to words. The city has the power to lower speed limits now. It has the power to keep cameras running. It has the power to act. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The bill, discussed in May 2022, aims to allow 24/7 automated enforcement and add penalties for repeat offenders, including registration suspensions. The matter summary: 'DOT officials said they’re negotiating amendments to Gounardes’ bill that would further crack down on reckless drivers, including a provision to let the city install cameras to ticket cars in bike lanes.' Gounardes stressed urgency: 'We cannot leave Albany without reauthorizing the speed cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s late push for home rule caused confusion, risking the program’s renewal. The bill is under negotiation as the legislative session nears its end. Eleven people died on city streets that week, underscoring the stakes for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July. Assembly Member William Magnarelli, chair of the Transportation Committee, blamed City Hall for inaction. Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo. Without home rule, New York City’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—face continued risk from political delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan’s summary states it will 'address local climate crises by reducing building and vehicular emissions, expanding green space and infrastructure, building storm surge protection, and achieving zero waste.' Restler, the sole sponsor, called for urgent neighborhood action, saying, 'We need to roll up our sleeves and take action at the local level, at the neighborhood level on our blocks.' The plan proposes new bike lanes, electrified school buses, and more renewable energy. Environmental advocates back the approach for its focus on neighborhood needs.

Lawmakers failed to act.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0329-2022 was introduced to the Committee on Public Safety on May 5, 2022. The bill aimed to amend the city code to 'establish a reward for individuals who provide information leading to the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person who seriously injures or kills another individual in a hit-and-run accident.' Council Member Rita C. Joseph sponsored the bill, joined by sixteen co-sponsors including Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, and others. The bill would have authorized up to $1,000 for information leading to the capture of hit-and-run drivers, but excluded law enforcement and city employees from eligibility. The measure was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. With the bill's failure, the city offers no extra incentive to help catch drivers who leave victims bleeding in the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
