Forty-two seriously hurt.</strong> That is the cost on Brooklyn CB2 streets since 2022. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last year alone, five lives ended and ten more were shattered by injuries that will not heal. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons, and daughters.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a woman was crushed at the corner of Fulton and Washington. She was 55. She died in the street, struck by an SUV.

The street is not safe for the slow or the small.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have voted to extend school speed zones and back bills to curb repeat speeders. Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Jabari Brisport</a> and Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/57/>Phara Souffrant Forrest</a> both voted yes to extend speed cameras in school zones. The law is clear: &ldquo;improving child pedestrian safety.&rdquo;</p><p>But the carnage continues. The cameras catch speeders, but the city has not lowered the default speed limit to 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers—those with a record of tickets—still roam free. The bills are on the table. The bodies are on the street.</p><h3 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h3><p>A neighbor, after a hit-and-run, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said it plain</a>: &ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</p><p>A relative, after a woman was killed by a car, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

Advocates want $500 million yearly to keep subways and buses moving. Riders face fare hikes and service cuts if lawmakers stall. The fight is urgent. Riders wait. Cars kill. Transit saves lives.</p><p class=mb3>This funding debate centers on Gov. Hochul’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget, which allocates $6.6 billion in operating aid for the MTA but lacks new dedicated revenue. The proposal, discussed on January 28, 2022, has not advanced to a formal committee or bill stage. The matter: 'Who Wants To Give The MTA Half A Billion Dollars?' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backs progressive funding, saying, 'Funding high-ridership bus routes and the subway such that transit options would be arriving every six minutes is something we need to be pushing for.' Comptroller Brad Lander and advocates like the Riders Alliance demand $500 million per year to avoid fare hikes and boost service. The push is clear: more frequent, affordable transit keeps vulnerable New Yorkers out of harm’s way. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the stakes for pedestrians and riders are life and death.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
