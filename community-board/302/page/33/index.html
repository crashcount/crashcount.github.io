The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world.

In her statement, Hudson said the tragedy 'underscores the dire need to continue our fight for safer streets in District 35 and across the city.' She outlined demands: finish the Ashland Place bike lane, reauthorize and strengthen the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, add crossing guards and shift oversight from NYPD to DOT, install bulb-outs and daylighting near schools, speed up DOT review for speed humps, and build more protected bike lanes. Hudson also announced a District 35 Street Infrastructure Advisory Board. She acknowledged past hesitancy but now commits to stronger advocacy.

Their joint statement read, 'this is not the time to rethink a street safety program that has brought traffic deaths to historic lows in New York City,' and called for expanding, not reconsidering, safety measures.

The event followed his administration’s interruption of several safe street projects. When pressed by a Streetsblog reporter—'Why should New Yorkers trust you to make the city’s streets safer?'—Adams replied, 'I love New York, I love New York,' and left without a substantive answer. The matter, as reported, centers on public frustration: 'Adams had previously promised to do "whatever it takes to keep our streets safe" after the child’s death.' Council Member Crystal Hudson and Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for urgent safety improvements. A Brooklyn parent’s letter demanding action drew 1,800 signatures in days. The mayor’s silence deepened distrust. The city’s vulnerable remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, organized by Vision Zero opponents, was set to criticize the city's road safety program. But after a tow truck driver killed 7-year-old Kamei Hughes near Fort Greene Park, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Crystal Hudson withdrew. In their open letter, they wrote, 'Holding a forum where Vision Zero will be criticized in the neighborhood next to where a young boy’s life was lost to traffic violence sends the wrong message to the community and to our borough.' The church, led by Rev. Anthony Trufant, canceled the meeting. Local residents called for more enforcement against reckless drivers. The tragedy underscored the stakes: pedestrian deaths are down, but the toll of traffic violence remains high.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash happened near Fort Greene Park, where witnesses reported the driver was speeding, using her phone, and dragged the child before stopping. The intersection’s visibility was blocked by a legally parked car, as New York City exempts itself from state daylighting rules. Council Member Crystal Hudson visited the scene, spoke with police and residents, and acknowledged a pattern of reckless tow truck driving. Hudson said, 'This is the worst possible outcome, and, yet, we are forced to reckon with the worst possible outcome at the hands of the NYPD all too often.' Residents demanded speed bumps and crossing guards. The crash came as the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and crossing guard positions were cut. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for an end to 'senseless traffic violence.'

The Red Hook Civic Association sent a letter urging the MTA to create a regular-fare bus through the Hugh Carey Tunnel. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the push, saying, "The people of Red Hook really deserve this." The MTA rejected the idea, citing congestion in the tunnel and Lower Manhattan. Joana Flores, MTA spokesperson, said it is more efficient for riders to transfer to the subway. Critics, including Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance, countered, "Bad traffic is not an excuse for not improving bus service, it’s an impetus for decongesting the street." Past proposals to extend the M22 or restore the B71 with a Manhattan extension were dismissed over cost and logistics. Advocates argue that buses move more people than cars and that congestion pricing should clear the way for better transit. The proposal remains stalled, leaving vulnerable riders waiting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to create a dedicated parking enforcement unit. Its summary: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the establishment of a parking enforcement unit within the department of transportation.' Council Members Christopher Marte (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, and Rita C. Joseph backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The proposal would have targeted illegal parking, a key threat to pedestrians and cyclists. With the bill’s failure, enforcement remains fragmented. Vulnerable road users continue to face blocked crosswalks and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Jennifer Gutiérrez, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, and Kevin C. Riley. The bill targeted fare burdens on riders with long, complex trips, who now pay more than those with direct routes.

The law, sponsored by Gale A. Brewer with co-sponsors including Erik D. Bottcher, Lincoln Restler, and others, amends the city code to require the Department of Transportation to report on vehicles with license plates unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems. The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The reports must be public and sent to the Mayor and Council Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Advocates worry which street safety project Mayor Adams will abandon next,' details how the city cut the length of a planned protected bike lane on McGuinness Boulevard and reduced the scope of a Fordham Road busway. Restler said, 'I have no expectations that bold, big projects that can make our streets safer... are going to be happening in this administration.' He revealed the Department of Transportation was told to halt large bike and bus lane expansions due to waning political support. The administration’s actions leave vulnerable road users exposed, as cycling deaths rise and promised safety infrastructure stalls. The city fell short of its protected bike lane targets, endangering those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
