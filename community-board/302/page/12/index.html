An SUV crushes her. She dies on the street. Her name is not in the headlines. She is one of twelve killed in Brooklyn CB2 since 2022. Forty-two more have been left with serious injuries. Some will never walk again. Some will never speak. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-relentless>The Pattern Is Relentless</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed two, left 12 with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all add to the toll. No one is safe. Not the child on a bike. Not the old man crossing the street. Not the woman waiting for the light. The disaster moves slow, but it never stops.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Local leaders have talked about safety. They have sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, to speed up protected bike lanes, to require daylighting at intersections. But the pace is slow. The bills sit in committee. The danger does not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a> after a recent hit-and-run. The driver fled. The city keeps counting the dead.</p><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson and Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest have backed safety bills. But the streets are still deadly. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done so. <strong>&ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said a neighbor</a>. The city has not listened.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand daylight at every corner. Do not wait for another body in the street. Do not let them wait, either.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution calls for 'amend[ing] the Vehicle and Traffic Law, in relation to registration fees for certain vehicles.' Council Members Justin L. Brannan (primary sponsor, District 47) and Lincoln Restler (co-sponsor, District 33) lead the charge. The bill would raise registration fees for larger, heavier vehicles, with a break for electric car batteries. The resolution cites grim numbers: 103 pedestrians killed in New York City in 2023, and research showing heavy vehicles are deadlier. The Council says this law could deter the spread of oversized cars, protect people on foot and bike, and cut emissions.
