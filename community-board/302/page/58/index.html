Forty-two seriously hurt.</strong> That is the cost on Brooklyn CB2 streets since 2022. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last year alone, five lives ended and ten more were shattered by injuries that will not heal. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons, and daughters.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a woman was crushed at the corner of Fulton and Washington. She was 55. She died in the street, struck by an SUV.

The street is not safe for the slow or the small.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have voted to extend school speed zones and back bills to curb repeat speeders. Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Jabari Brisport</a> and Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/57/>Phara Souffrant Forrest</a> both voted yes to extend speed cameras in school zones. The law is clear: &ldquo;improving child pedestrian safety.&rdquo;</p><p>But the carnage continues. The cameras catch speeders, but the city has not lowered the default speed limit to 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers—those with a record of tickets—still roam free. The bills are on the table. The bodies are on the street.</p><h3 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h3><p>A neighbor, after a hit-and-run, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said it plain</a>: &ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</p><p>A relative, after a woman was killed by a car, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

The matter, titled 'New App Helps Reckless Drivers Thumb Their Noses at City’s Speed Cameras,' drew sharp criticism from safe-streets activists and the NYPD, who called such apps a 'significant public safety concern.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, representing District 26, took action to reauthorize and expand the city’s speed camera program. Advocates Jacob deCastro and Jehiah Czebotar demanded more cameras and stricter enforcement, arguing that cameras save lives and change driver behavior.

The article, titled "New App Helps Reckless Drivers Thumb Their Noses at City’s Speed Cameras," details how the app lets drivers evade enforcement and dispute tickets. Safe-streets groups, including Transportation Alternatives and engineer Jehiah Czebotar, condemned the app. Jacob deCastro of Transportation Alternatives said, "If drivers want to avoid speeding tickets, they simply should not speed." Czebotar added, "Any demand for notifications to help drivers avoid speed cameras is proof that actually enforcing the speed limit does change driver behavior for the better." The NYPD warned that such apps undermine public safety. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes is pushing to reauthorize and expand the speed camera program.

Senator Gounardes pushes to renew and expand the program. Cameras now guard schools, but the law may expire. Advocates demand more hours, tougher penalties. The clock ticks. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill (no number given) led by State Senator Andrew Gounardes faces debate in Albany as of May 13, 2022. The bill seeks to renew and strengthen New York City’s school speed zone camera program, which is set to expire June 2. The measure would expand camera hours to 24/7 and increase penalties for repeat offenders, including insurance notification and license suspension. The committee and current status are not specified, but only nine legislative days remain. The bill summary states: 'New York City officials are in conflict with state lawmakers in Albany over the future of school speed zone cameras.' Gounardes is confident in renewal. Mayor Eric Adams and advocates want home rule for NYC on speed cameras and speed limits, but Albany resists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez urges lawmakers to use every tool to fight reckless driving. The bill’s fate will shape the city’s ability to protect pedestrians and cyclists from speeding drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in May 2022, aims to allow 24/7 automated enforcement and add penalties for repeat offenders, including registration suspensions. The matter summary: 'DOT officials said they’re negotiating amendments to Gounardes’ bill that would further crack down on reckless drivers, including a provision to let the city install cameras to ticket cars in bike lanes.' Gounardes stressed urgency: 'We cannot leave Albany without reauthorizing the speed cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s late push for home rule caused confusion, risking the program’s renewal. The bill is under negotiation as the legislative session nears its end. Eleven people died on city streets that week, underscoring the stakes for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Adams and DOT backed home rule, but lawmakers stalled. Senator Gounardes now fights to renew and expand camera programs before they shut off. Vulnerable road users remain exposed. Local power denied.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes’s bill S5602 sought to grant New York City control over its speed and red-light camera programs. The effort failed this session. The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July. Assembly Member William Magnarelli, chair of the Transportation Committee, blamed City Hall for inaction. Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo. Without home rule, New York City’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—face continued risk from political delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He announced a $904 million budget for safety improvements and said, 'We need to find them proactively, and get them off the streets.' Adams called for meetings with precincts and targeting dangerous intersections. But he gave no specifics on enforcement, legislative changes, or expanding the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Advocates like Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) and Sara Lind (Open Plans) welcomed the words but demanded concrete action, especially from the NYPD. The city’s current laws limit its power to remove dangerous drivers. Pending state bills could help, but for now, the mayor’s promise remains just that—words, not protection for those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, titled 'Advocates demand action as NYC traffic deaths rise 44% in 2022,' revealed 59 deaths in the year's first quarter, the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. Pedestrians and minors suffered most. Gounardes declared, 'It is unacceptable that there have been more traffic fatalities this year than since Vision Zero began.' Transportation Alternatives called for Mayor Adams to back a $3.1 billion DOT street redesign plan and for Albany to grant NYC home rule over traffic cameras. Advocates demand more bike lanes, safer intersections, and unrestricted camera enforcement.

The officer, accused of speeding and running a red light, was placed on modified duty. The Internal Affairs Bureau and the state Attorney General opened investigations. The NYPD refused to release crash details or the officer's name. Council Member Crystal Hudson issued a blistering statement demanding the officer's termination, not desk duty. The matter summary states, 'The police officer who was driving the NYPD vehicle that fatally struck a man...has been placed on modified duty.' The NYPD's lack of transparency is routine. Truths surface only after lawsuits. In 2020, vehicle crashes cost the city $142 million. Police settlements are a heavy burden. The system shields its own, leaving families to seek answers in court.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
