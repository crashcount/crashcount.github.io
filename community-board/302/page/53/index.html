Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,300 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue. Each crash is a life ended or broken. Each is a story cut short.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> They killed two people and injured more than 300 on foot. Trucks and buses added to the toll. Bikes and e-bikes hurt dozens, but the deadliest threat rolled on four wheels. The numbers are plain: the street is not safe for the unprotected.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world.

He was just standing near the corner when the driver turned and hit him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Police said officers who responded to the scene discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus at East 12th Street and Avenue Z in Sheepshead Bay around 6:40 p.m.</a></p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every stalled bill, every unprotected crosswalk, every ignored speed limit is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes that do not disappear.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The officer, accused of speeding and running a red light, was placed on modified duty. The Internal Affairs Bureau and the state Attorney General opened investigations. The NYPD refused to release crash details or the officer's name. Council Member Crystal Hudson issued a blistering statement demanding the officer's termination, not desk duty. The matter summary states, 'The police officer who was driving the NYPD vehicle that fatally struck a man...has been placed on modified duty.' The NYPD's lack of transparency is routine. Truths surface only after lawsuits. In 2020, vehicle crashes cost the city $142 million. Police settlements are a heavy burden. The system shields its own, leaving families to seek answers in court.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders in transit deserts face long waits, missed trains, and crowded platforms. The resolution highlights gaps in service that strand working New Yorkers far from Manhattan.</p><p class=mb3>Res 0110-2022 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution, introduced April 14, 2022, and filed at session's end on December 31, 2023, urges the MTA to 'adjust schedules for distant subway terminal lines to include more peak-direction rush hour trains for commuters to travel to central economic hubs.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Bottcher, and others. The bill responds to service gaps hitting outer boroughs, end-of-line stations, and transit deserts—areas where 600,000 New Yorkers live with poor transit access. The council points to pandemic-era staffing shortages and train cancellations that left riders stranded. The measure aims to push the MTA to close these gaps and connect more New Yorkers to jobs and opportunity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Carroll called the requirement "reasonable." Stephen Walling, president of the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools, said the bill would "go a long way towards keeping all New Yorkers safer on our roads."

He blamed Albany for tying the city’s hands. He called out the NYPD for weak enforcement. Twenty-seven pedestrians dead this year. Cameras go dark at night. Speeders win. Vulnerable lives lost.</p><p class=mb3>On March 25, 2022, Mayor Adams held a press conference on street safety and traffic enforcement policy. The event spotlighted the city’s struggle to control its own traffic laws. Adams slammed state rules that force red light and speed cameras off between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., calling it 'unbelievable.' He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year. The mayor pressed for 24/7 camera operation and renewed NYPD focus. The council and advocates demand Albany act before more lives are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
