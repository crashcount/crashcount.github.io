Since 2022, <strong>12 people have died</strong>. <strong>Forty-two more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful. They only count the bodies.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a woman was crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. She was 55. She died on the street, not at an intersection, not in a crosswalk—just in the path of a machine built heavier and faster than any human body could bear. The city logs her as another statistic. The street remains the same.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>A 74-year-old man was killed at Tillary and Jay, thrown from his e-bike by a turning bus. The record says &ldquo;crush injuries.&rdquo; It does not say who waited for him at home. It does not say what was left behind.</p><p>A cyclist’s arm was severed by a car door on Flatbush. A child’s knee was shattered by a driver who failed to yield. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by a city that moves too slow to protect its own.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Council Member <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. The city is daylighting intersections and building more bike lanes. But the pace is glacial. Each delay is paid in flesh.</p><p>Some bills claim to help but shift the burden to those already at risk. Enforcement falls hardest on cyclists and delivery workers, not the drivers who kill. The street stays dangerous. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and hold reckless drivers to account. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not excuses.</strong></p><p>The street will not change itself. The blood on the asphalt is a message. It is written in the names we forget. Do not let it be written again.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Other key street safety bills, including 'Sammy’s Law'—which would let NYC set its own speed limits—did not advance. Senator Andrew Gounardes called the speed camera win 'monumental,' while Senator Brad Hoylman said, 'not as much as any of us would have wanted to see, but for the first time, speed cameras are normalized.'

Lawmakers extended New York City's school-zone speed camera program for three years, allowing 24/7 operation—a win for street safety. The bill, however, was watered down. Other measures under the 'Crash Victims Rights and Safety Act' saw mixed results: some passed, like upstate towns setting 25 mph speed limits and increased complete streets funding; others, like 'Sammy's Law' for NYC speed limits and expanded safe passing for cyclists, stalled. The matter title called the session 'historic, yet deeply disappointing.' Adams was not a sponsor but was referenced in the debate. Advocates and senators voiced frustration at the lack of progress on local speed limit control and measures against repeat reckless drivers.

The report lists the contributing factor as "Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle," indicating the driver’s response to another vehicle not involved in the crash played a role.

Expansion aims to cut deadly crashes citywide.</p><p class=mb3>On May 31, 2022, the State Senate approved a bill to extend and expand New York City's speed camera program. The measure passed 51-12 and now moves to the Assembly. The bill allows cameras to operate 24/7 in nearly 2,000 locations across 750 school zones until July 1, 2025. The matter summary states, 'The proposal to extend New York City's speed camera program for another three years and expand it to run every day and around the clock easily passed.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored the bill, saying, 'We are going to see a marked reduction in traffic violence on our streets at a time when traffic deaths are at their highest in a decade.' Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams. Some penalties for repeat speeders were removed during negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers cut tougher penalties for repeat offenders. Advocates called the final bill a win, but mourned lost safety measures. Vulnerable road users remain exposed to reckless drivers.</p><p class=mb3>On May 23, 2022, the New York State legislature passed a bill allowing New York City to operate speed cameras 24/7. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick, originally included tougher measures: escalating fines, registration suspensions, and insurance reporting for repeat speeders. These provisions were stripped during negotiations, leaving only the round-the-clock camera operation. Assembly Member Glick said, 'keeping the cameras on 24/7 was that hill.' Mayor Eric Adams called it 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives.' Advocacy groups and lawmakers voiced frustration at Albany’s reluctance to adopt stronger safety tools. The final law removes blackout periods for cameras, but leaves dangerous drivers with fewer consequences. The bill passed despite disappointment over its dilution, exposing the limits of legislative action for street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
