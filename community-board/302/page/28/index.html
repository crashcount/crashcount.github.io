Since 2022, <strong>12 people have died</strong>. <strong>Forty-two more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful. They only count the bodies.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a woman was crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. She was 55. She died on the street, not at an intersection, not in a crosswalk—just in the path of a machine built heavier and faster than any human body could bear. The city logs her as another statistic. The street remains the same.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>A 74-year-old man was killed at Tillary and Jay, thrown from his e-bike by a turning bus. The record says &ldquo;crush injuries.&rdquo; It does not say who waited for him at home. It does not say what was left behind.</p><p>A cyclist’s arm was severed by a car door on Flatbush. A child’s knee was shattered by a driver who failed to yield. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by a city that moves too slow to protect its own.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Council Member <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. The city is daylighting intersections and building more bike lanes. But the pace is glacial. Each delay is paid in flesh.</p><p>Some bills claim to help but shift the burden to those already at risk. Enforcement falls hardest on cyclists and delivery workers, not the drivers who kill. The street stays dangerous. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and hold reckless drivers to account. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not excuses.</strong></p><p>The street will not change itself. The blood on the asphalt is a message. It is written in the names we forget. Do not let it be written again.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams showed little urgency. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi said, 'We will look to the advocacy world for support to go to the state and get better restrictions and better enforcement tools.' State Sen.

The MTA says no. Residents wait. Cars clog the tunnel. Advocates demand space for buses, not excuses. The city’s working class and disabled riders are left stranded. The fight for fair transit continues.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2023, Red Hook residents and advocates renewed calls for a direct bus route to Manhattan. The Red Hook Civic Association sent a letter urging the MTA to create a regular-fare bus through the Hugh Carey Tunnel. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the push, saying, "The people of Red Hook really deserve this." The MTA rejected the idea, citing congestion in the tunnel and Lower Manhattan. Joana Flores, MTA spokesperson, said it is more efficient for riders to transfer to the subway. Critics, including Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance, countered, "Bad traffic is not an excuse for not improving bus service, it’s an impetus for decongesting the street." Past proposals to extend the M22 or restore the B71 with a Manhattan extension were dismissed over cost and logistics. Advocates argue that buses move more people than cars and that congestion pricing should clear the way for better transit. The proposal remains stalled, leaving vulnerable riders waiting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags.

Cyclists lost a safe route. Advocates, officials, and residents rallied. They blamed City Hall for caving to a developer. The most dangerous block remains untouched. Eighty-eight crashes scar the street. Safety took a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On October 13, 2023, local officials and advocates criticized Mayor Adams for halting the Ashland Place redesign. The project, led by the Department of Transportation, aimed to create a protected bike lane from the Manhattan Bridge to Barclays Center. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso said, "New York City is regressing on meeting its Vision Zero goals ... and stalled street safety improvements, like those slated for Ashland Place, are a part of the reason why." State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety. City Hall deflected, blaming e-bikes for rising cyclist deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
