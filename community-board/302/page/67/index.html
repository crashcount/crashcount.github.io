The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world.

He tried to ride the Schermerhorn Street bike lane after a snowstorm. The lane was blocked by snow and illegally parked vehicles. Restler took 41 minutes to travel half a mile and was forced to leave the lane. He declared, 'No one should have to bike into traffic because of a row of illegally parked cars.' Restler called for a comprehensive street redesign and protected bike lanes, saying, 'There’s a crisis on Schermerhorn Street.' The Department of Transportation is reportedly working on a proposal. Restler’s action highlights the failure of painted lanes to protect cyclists. Most lanes in Downtown Brooklyn remain unprotected and easily blocked, putting riders at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates want $500 million yearly to keep subways and buses moving. Riders face fare hikes and service cuts if lawmakers stall. The fight is urgent. Riders wait. Cars kill. Transit saves lives.</p><p class=mb3>This funding debate centers on Gov. Hochul’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget, which allocates $6.6 billion in operating aid for the MTA but lacks new dedicated revenue. The proposal, discussed on January 28, 2022, has not advanced to a formal committee or bill stage. The matter: 'Who Wants To Give The MTA Half A Billion Dollars?' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backs progressive funding, saying, 'Funding high-ridership bus routes and the subway such that transit options would be arriving every six minutes is something we need to be pushing for.' Comptroller Brad Lander and advocates like the Riders Alliance demand $500 million per year to avoid fare hikes and boost service. The push is clear: more frequent, affordable transit keeps vulnerable New Yorkers out of harm’s way. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the stakes for pedestrians and riders are life and death.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
