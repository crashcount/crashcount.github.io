Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,300 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue. Each crash is a life ended or broken. Each is a story cut short.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> They killed two people and injured more than 300 on foot. Trucks and buses added to the toll. Bikes and e-bikes hurt dozens, but the deadliest threat rolled on four wheels. The numbers are plain: the street is not safe for the unprotected.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world.

This is policy.</strong> Every stalled bill, every unprotected crosswalk, every ignored speed limit is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes that do not disappear.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city moves.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2025, the City Council held a hearing on congestion pricing’s effects, as reported by Streetsblog NYC. The session reviewed how the new toll for driving below 60th Street cut traffic and boosted bus speeds. MTA Transit President Demetrius Crichlow told council members, “Every single crossing that gets into Manhattan has seen an improvement, some lines as much as seven to 10 minutes improved speeds.” Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) said, “It sounds like there may be opportunities for us to increase service as the result of more efficient travel times.” The MTA is piloting schedule changes on seven bus lines. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called the changes “exactly what it was supposed to do.” Bus riders, pedestrians, and the city’s economy all benefit. No evidence shows traffic shifting to other boroughs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2025, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced the lowering of Dumbo’s speed limit to 20 mph, making it Brooklyn’s first Regional Slow Zone. The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seabrook had been out on bail for a previous crash involving police. On January 8, 2024, he crashed into a Toyota, killing Hayden Wallace and injuring three others. Seabrook fled the scene, abandoning his vehicle. The article notes, "All accidents are useless but this one was even more useless because [Seabrook] had so many other offenses." Seabrook faces 23 charges, including manslaughter, leaving the scene, unlicensed driving, and speeding. The case highlights repeated driver offenses and questions about bail and enforcement. Police needed over a year to arrest Seabrook, who had a history of fleeing crashes and driving without a license.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds.
