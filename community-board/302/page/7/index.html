The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world. She made me a better person, a better man,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>said James Cifuni</a> after his pregnant wife was run down and killed in Brooklyn. &ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same.&rdquo;</p><p>On another street, a bus pinned an 87-year-old man under its wheels. He was just standing near the corner when the driver turned and hit him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Police said officers who responded to the scene discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus at East 12th Street and Avenue Z in Sheepshead Bay around 6:40 p.m.</a></p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every stalled bill, every unprotected crosswalk, every ignored speed limit is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes that do not disappear.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds.

The bill divided the city into zones: the Manhattan core, an inner transit zone with no parking mandates, an outer transit zone with reduced mandates, and areas beyond where mandates mostly remain. The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.' Council Member Sandy Nurse’s district saw mandates shaped by community board amendments, not her advocacy. Dan Garodnick, Department of City Planning chair, said, 'parking and housing are no longer coming into conflict in the parts of New York City that are well-served by transit.' The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others.
