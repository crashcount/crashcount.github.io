Forty-two have suffered serious injuries.</strong> In just over three years, Brooklyn CB2 has seen 5,209 crashes. The names fade, but the pain does not. A woman, 55, crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. A cyclist, 74, killed by a bus turning at Tillary and Jay. A passenger, 45, gone in a tangle of metal on Flatbush and State. The dead do not get second chances. The living carry scars.</p><p><strong>Most victims are not behind the wheel.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons—<strong>344 pedestrian injuries and deaths from cars and SUVs alone</strong>. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Local leaders have acted, but the pace is slow. <strong>Senator Jabari Brisport and Senator Andrew Gounardes voted yes to extend school speed zones</strong> and to require speed limiters for repeat offenders. These votes matter. They save lives. But the work is not finished. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders still drive. The city can do more. It must.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>said Governor Hochul as she signed the renewal into law</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. <strong>&ldquo;Our message to drivers was clear: follow the rules or face the law,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch</a>. The message is clear. The streets are not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, and those who hold power. The dead cannot speak. The living must. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat offenders.</strong> Join the fight. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><hr><p><strong>Act now.

The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution. The program’s future remains uncertain, with vulnerable road users facing continued risk from unchecked car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
