A Ford Explorer hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>The driver of the Ford Explorer sped off without stopping, stunned witnesses told police.</a></p><p>A week before, a motorcyclist died on the BQE. The driver he hit was unlicensed, driving without a court-ordered ignition lock. Police made an arrest. The dead man’s name was Sean Johnson. He was 27. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bqe-traffic-collision-arrest-05102025/>Police arrested 44-year-old Laura Cordova&mldr; for driving without a license and using a vehicle without ignition interlock.</a></p><p>A woman stepped out of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

They talk about speed cameras and new laws. They say, &ldquo;We understand there is more work to do… one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many, but our administration remains committed to reducing traffic violence as much as any other form of violence.&rdquo; But the streets do not listen to words. The city has the power to lower speed limits now. It has the power to keep cameras running. It has the power to act. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The bill, now before the City Council, aims to crack down on placard abuse by city workers, which Restler calls 'petty corruption.' The matter summary states the legislation would force agencies to revoke most placards not protected by union contracts. Restler also proposed a bill letting New Yorkers report illegal placards and collect a share of fines. Street safety advocates back the move, saying, 'Ending placard abuse in New York City will make our streets safe, while ensuring bus and bike riders can stay moving—unobstructed by illegally stored cars.' The bill follows years of failed enforcement and mounting placard numbers. Restler’s action targets a system that blocks crosswalks, endangers pedestrians, and slows public transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Former Council Member Steve Levin and advocates pushed for these changes for years. Some locals criticized Qwick Curbs as ugly, but DOT officials stressed the board's advisory role.

Both were restrained by lap belts and harnesses and were not ejected from their vehicles. The report lists driver inattention and distraction as contributing factors for both drivers. The crash caused center front-end damage to the moving vehicles and left rear bumper damage to a parked sedan. No pedestrian or cyclist was involved. The injuries and shock experienced by the drivers highlight the impact of distracted driving in this collision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The proposal, which is non-binding, was not assigned to a council committee but sets a template for local advocacy and funding. The plan’s summary states it will 'address local climate crises by reducing building and vehicular emissions, expanding green space and infrastructure, building storm surge protection, and achieving zero waste.' Restler, the sole sponsor, called for urgent neighborhood action, saying, 'We need to roll up our sleeves and take action at the local level, at the neighborhood level on our blocks.' The plan proposes new bike lanes, electrified school buses, and more renewable energy. Environmental advocates back the approach for its focus on neighborhood needs. While not law, the plan signals a push for safer, greener streets and less car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
