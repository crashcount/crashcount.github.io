Forty-two seriously injured.</strong> More than 2,400 hurt since 2022. The streets do not forgive. Each number is a body, a family, a life split open. The latest: a 55-year-old woman, crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. A 45-year-old passenger, killed at Flatbush and State. A 74-year-old man, thrown from his e-bike, never to stand again. The list does not end.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>There is no poetry in the aftermath. Only the sound of sirens and the silence that follows. <strong>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo;</strong> said Henry Tziquin, whose father was killed by a hit-and-run driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>in Brooklyn</a>. The pain is not abstract. It is a son searching for his father on the ground, eyes closed, never to open again.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In CB2, they are behind the majority of deaths and serious injuries to people on foot and bike. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll, but the pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—walkers, cyclists, children—pay the price for someone else’s speed, someone else’s mistake.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Council Member Crystal Hudson has co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. The city is daylighting intersections and adding bike lanes, but the pace is slow. <strong>Speed cameras are up, but loopholes remain.</strong> The state renewed the speed camera program, and Senator Andrew Gounardes said, <strong>&ldquo;speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>during the reauthorization</a>. But the dead keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, clear crosswalks, and enforcement that targets the real danger—drivers who kill and flee. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The campaign, led by Bike South Brooklyn, the Bay Ridge Environmental Group, and Transportation Alternatives, demands a 'better, safer Fourth Avenue' with a road diet and protected bike lanes. Council Member Justin Brannan, who represents Bay Ridge, has a mixed record—once supportive, now silent as his term ends. State Senator Andrew Gounardes supports the redesign, citing risks to pedestrians and cyclists: 'the design of the street puts your safety at risk.' The DOT has not proposed changes south of Sunset Park, leaving Bay Ridge exposed. Advocates vow to keep fighting for safety, regardless of political will.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler and colleagues highlighted the intersection's dangers and the driver's history—35 tickets since 2019, including 26 speed camera violations. They urged support for bills requiring speed control devices for repeat offenders and for Sammy’s Law, which would let NYC set its own speed limits.

Pollution drops. Wallets breathe easier.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill S1981A, proposed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, demands a 20-percent reduction in vehicle miles traveled statewide by 2050. The bill, backed by New Yorkers for Transportation Equity, was introduced last year and is under consideration. The measure’s summary promises to 'improve air quality and reduce fatal crashes.' Gounardes, representing Brooklyn’s western edge, champions the shift: 'A new approach will not only protect our climate, but also make New York a safer, more affordable place to live.' Analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute projects 593 fewer traffic deaths each year, with thousands more lives saved through active transportation. The bill’s focus is clear: less driving, more safety, cleaner air, and real savings for families.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installation of pedestrian lighting fixtures,' would require the transportation commissioner to install sidewalk lighting in at least 500 commercial corridors per year, each lit to a minimum of 1 footcandle (11 lux). At least 450 corridors must be contiguous to others with new or existing lighting. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Krishnan, Bottcher, and many others. The bill aims to cut through the city’s darkness, demanding light for those on foot. It remains stalled in committee, its promise unrealized.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Obstructed plates let reckless drivers hide. Cameras miss them. Streets grow more dangerous. The bill targets this loophole. It sits in committee. Action is pending.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0026-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on February 8, 2024. The measure urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to require inspectors to fail any vehicle with a damaged or obstructed license plate. The resolution states: 'Obstructed and defaced license plates prevent cameras and law enforcement from identifying traffic offenders and impedes safe operating conditions on the road.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Sandra Ung, Crystal Hudson, and Selvena N. Brooks-Powers back the bill. They want to close a gap that lets drivers dodge red light and speed cameras. The bill aims to stop offenders from hiding behind unreadable plates. It remains in committee, awaiting further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill demands a study on 'the feasibility of installing raised crosswalks, raised intersections, and speed reducers at intersections and roadways adjacent to schools.' Council Member Julie Menin leads, joined by Schulman, Hudson, Brooks-Powers, Riley, Lee, Louis, Restler, and Gutiérrez as sponsors. The bill would repeal and replace Section 19-189 of the city code, requiring the Department of Transportation to report crash data and feasibility findings to the Mayor and Council Speaker. After the study, the Commissioner may install traffic-calming measures where possible. The bill remains 'Laid Over in Committee' as of June 25, 2024. No safety analyst note is available, but the bill targets systemic risk where children walk and drivers speed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
