Forty-two seriously injured.</strong> More than 2,400 hurt since 2022. The streets do not forgive. Each number is a body, a family, a life split open. The latest: a 55-year-old woman, crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. A 45-year-old passenger, killed at Flatbush and State. A 74-year-old man, thrown from his e-bike, never to stand again. The list does not end.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>There is no poetry in the aftermath. Only the sound of sirens and the silence that follows. <strong>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo;</strong> said Henry Tziquin, whose father was killed by a hit-and-run driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>in Brooklyn</a>. The pain is not abstract. It is a son searching for his father on the ground, eyes closed, never to open again.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In CB2, they are behind the majority of deaths and serious injuries to people on foot and bike. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll, but the pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—walkers, cyclists, children—pay the price for someone else’s speed, someone else’s mistake.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Council Member Crystal Hudson has co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. The city is daylighting intersections and adding bike lanes, but the pace is slow. <strong>Speed cameras are up, but loopholes remain.</strong> The state renewed the speed camera program, and Senator Andrew Gounardes said, <strong>&ldquo;speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>during the reauthorization</a>. But the dead keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, clear crosswalks, and enforcement that targets the real danger—drivers who kill and flee. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, discussed on June 2, 2023, involves no formal bill but features heated criticism in the City Council and from state officials. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the city's planning 'shortsighted' and warned of 'catastrophic' consequences if the cantilever collapses. Council Member Lincoln Restler voiced 'disappointment' over DOT's delay in automated truck weight enforcement. The Adams administration is considering a full six-lane rebuild, which Simon says would be 'just as polluting and climate insensitive.' DOT claims the BQE is safe and promises interim repairs, but work on a permanent fix may not start until 2027. Local officials expect more delays due to community opposition and litigation. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the city fails to act swiftly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Jen Gutierrez called the refusal to vote 'unbelievable,' saying, 'Families across the city deserve this vote.' Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother, called the inaction 'unconscionable.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said the bill lacks support to reach the floor. The bill passed the City Council’s home rule message but faces Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie’s resistance.

The announcement, made at One Police Plaza, highlighted the bill sponsored by Simon and Sen. John Liu. The matter summary states, 'Officials called on Albany to pass legislation to lower the BAC threshold to .05%, arguing it would reduce DWI fatalities by about 10% and align with other countries.' Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but officials cite 43 NYC DWI deaths in 2021 and say 30% of state crashes involve alcohol.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
