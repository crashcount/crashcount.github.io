Forty-two with injuries so severe they change a life.</strong> That is the toll in Brooklyn CB2 since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about excuses. In the last year alone, four people died. Six more were left with serious wounds. The youngest was a child. The oldest, a senior. No one is spared.</p><p>A woman, 55, was crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington in May. She was crossing the street. She did not make it to the other side. The record says only this: &ldquo;Crush Injuries. Apparent Death.&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage:</strong> 2 killed, 12 seriously hurt, 330 more injured. Trucks and buses struck 60. Motorcycles and mopeds hit 13. Bikes, too, left 40 people hurt, one with injuries that will not heal. The street does not care what you drive. It only cares who is left on the ground.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The council talks about safety. They pass bills to ban parking near crosswalks, to build more protected bike lanes, to daylight intersections. They co-sponsor acts with names like SAFE Streets and push for speed limiters on repeat offenders. But the blood dries before the ink. The deaths keep coming.</p><p>Senator Gounardes said, <strong>&ldquo;The verdict came in a long time ago: speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>Streetsblog NYC</a>. But cameras do not stop a speeding car if the driver does not care. Laws do not save a woman in the crosswalk if the street is built for speed.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Every injury is a failure.

Police said the 41-year-old woman driving the black 2014 Mercedes GL 550 'came into contact' with the pedestrian. He suffered severe head trauma and died at Kings County Hospital. The driver remained at the scene and was not charged. The NYPD released little information, citing the Department of Transportation’s oversight of the Collision Investigation Squad. This fatality comes weeks after another deadly crash nearby involving a police officer. Attorney General Letitia James has opened a review of that earlier case. Smith’s sister criticized the NYPD for withholding information.

Czebotar added, "Any demand for notifications to help drivers avoid speed cameras is proof that actually enforcing the speed limit does change driver behavior for the better." The NYPD warned that such apps undermine public safety. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes is pushing to reauthorize and expand the speed camera program.

The bill summary states: 'New York City officials are in conflict with state lawmakers in Albany over the future of school speed zone cameras.' Gounardes is confident in renewal. Mayor Eric Adams and advocates want home rule for NYC on speed cameras and speed limits, but Albany resists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez urges lawmakers to use every tool to fight reckless driving.

Gounardes stressed urgency: 'We cannot leave Albany without reauthorizing the speed cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s late push for home rule caused confusion, risking the program’s renewal. The bill is under negotiation as the legislative session nears its end.

The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July.

Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo.
