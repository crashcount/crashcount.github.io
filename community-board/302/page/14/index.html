Forty-two with injuries so severe they change a life.</strong> That is the toll in Brooklyn CB2 since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about excuses. In the last year alone, four people died. Six more were left with serious wounds. The youngest was a child. The oldest, a senior. No one is spared.</p><p>A woman, 55, was crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington in May. She was crossing the street. She did not make it to the other side. The record says only this: &ldquo;Crush Injuries. Apparent Death.&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage:</strong> 2 killed, 12 seriously hurt, 330 more injured. Trucks and buses struck 60. Motorcycles and mopeds hit 13. Bikes, too, left 40 people hurt, one with injuries that will not heal. The street does not care what you drive. It only cares who is left on the ground.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The council talks about safety. They pass bills to ban parking near crosswalks, to build more protected bike lanes, to daylight intersections. They co-sponsor acts with names like SAFE Streets and push for speed limiters on repeat offenders. But the blood dries before the ink. The deaths keep coming.</p><p>Senator Gounardes said, <strong>&ldquo;The verdict came in a long time ago: speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>Streetsblog NYC</a>. But cameras do not stop a speeding car if the driver does not care. Laws do not save a woman in the crosswalk if the street is built for speed.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Every injury is a failure.
