An SUV sat stopped in traffic. A sedan drove straight. The right‑rear passenger was crushed. She did not make it. That was 11:04 p.m. on February 28. The city logged it as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4795527</a>.</p><p>Two more riders died on the BQE. One at 9:58 p.m. on May 10. A motorcycle hit the back of a slowing sedan. The rider died at the scene. The state called it <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4812048</a>. Another at 1:57 a.m. on July 3. A 55‑year‑old was ejected. Helmet on. Gone. That’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4825127</a>.</p><p>A 55‑year‑old woman tried to cross Fulton at Washington. She was not at an intersection. An SUV going west hit her. She died on May 17. The record is <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4813415</a>.</p><p>In this board, since 2022, <strong>13 people have died</strong> and 2,721 were hurt. Pedestrians took 490 injuries, with 17 listed as serious. Cyclists suffered 494 injuries, 16 serious. The counts sit in the city’s files for this area, dated through August 26, 2025. See the rollup in the same <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>BQE. Fulton. Flatbush. The names repeat in police logs. The pain repeats in families.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-bites>Where the street bites</h3><p>The BQE is the worst line on the map here: 309 injuries and three deaths since 2022. That is the top hotspot, stamped in the data as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>BROOKLYN QUEENS EXPRESSWAY</a>. Tillary Street follows with 58 injuries and four serious injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Fulton Street</a> shows 109 injuries.</p><p>The clock doesn’t help. Injuries stack up in the afternoon. From 1 p.m. through 5 p.m., the files show nine deaths and hundreds hurt, with a spike at 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. The hourly curve is in the board’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>distribution</a>.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hit>Who gets hit</h3><p>People outside cars carry the damage. Pedestrians: 490 injuries, 17 serious, two deaths. Cyclists: 494 injuries, 16 serious. Motorized micromobility adds another 123 injuries and three serious injuries. Cars and SUVs still drive most of the harm to walkers: sedans account for 170 pedestrian injuries; SUVs for 133. The board’s mode and vehicle tallies live in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>the dataset</a>.</p><p>Causes come cold on the page. “Other” factors sit atop with 767 injuries and 17 serious injuries. “Vulnerable road user error” is tagged in two deaths and 11 serious injuries. Distraction is there too. So are red lights blown and bad passes. The city labels and counts are in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>contributing factors</a>.</p><h3 id=promises-on-paper>Promises on paper</h3><p>At Flatbush and State, the passenger died while the SUV was “stopped in traffic,” the file says. The board’s council member, Lincoln Restler, has pressed bills to keep space clear and kids safer near schools. A resolution he sponsors would let a state bill ticket owners when cameras catch parking rule violations. It aims to stop the crosswalk and bike‑lane blockers that force people into traffic. The text sits in <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Res 1024‑2025</a>. The measure “calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5440.” That is the council’s record.</p><p>He also co‑sponsors a bill to force DOT to install school‑zone safety devices within 60 days of a study. The title is <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>. Another bill he leads would revoke placards for obscured plates. The listings are on the same <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council site</a>.</p><h3 id=what-albany-moved>What Albany moved</h3><p>Speed cameras will stay on through 2030. The governor signed the reauthorization on June 30. “Speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” she said. That’s in the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog report</a>. AMNY covered the same extension and noted the sponsors. Read it here: <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>renewed through 2030</a>.</p><p>In the Senate, lawmakers advanced a bill to clamp repeat speeders with intelligent speed assistance. Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes in committee. So did Senator Andrew Gounardes. The bill is <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. The committee records are linked on that page.</p><h3 id=what-must-change-on-these-blocks>What must change on these blocks</h3><ul><li>Daylight the corners on Fulton, Tillary, and Flatbush. Clear the sightlines that hide people in the crosswalk.</li><li>Harden the turns where drivers cut close. Protect walkers and cyclists at the apexes.</li><li>Target repeat hotspots on the BQE feeders with automated and manual enforcement during the peak injury hours listed above.</li></ul><p>These are small fixes. They keep bones intact.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The cost of delay</h3><p>Police and press keep writing the same lines in other parts of the city. “A driver struck and killed a 47‑year‑old pedestrian… then left the scene,” police said in Bushwick this month. That man was found dead in the road. The driver was gone. Read the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>Daily News</a> and <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Gothamist</a> coverage.</p><p>The pattern is not special. It is routine. It is ours.</p><h3 id=slow-it-down-citywide>Slow it down, citywide</h3><p>Albany renewed cameras. The Council is pushing to clear lanes and speed up school‑zone fixes. The state bill to force speed limiters on repeat offenders is moving. These steps cut risk for people on foot and on bikes. Pair them with a lower default speed limit and targeted fixes at BQE ramps, Fulton, Tillary, and Flatbush. Fewer sirens. Fewer vigils.</p><p>One call helps.

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes, who sponsored the last reauthorization, says, 'my bill to expand the speed camera program has saved lives.' The city wants stronger penalties for repeat offenders and action on license plate fraud, which lets millions of violations go unpunished. The report shows cameras cut speeding by 94 percent and reduce injuries and deaths. The program faces political hurdles, but the evidence is clear: speed cameras protect people on foot and bike.
