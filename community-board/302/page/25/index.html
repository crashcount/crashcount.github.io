The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world.

The moped driver, unlicensed and inexperienced, was traveling south and struck the right side doors of the westbound sedan. The sedan's sole occupant, a 33-year-old male driver, was ejected from the vehicle and sustained head injuries, resulting in incoherence and complaints of pain or nausea. The report highlights 'Driver Inexperience' as a contributing factor, with the moped driver operating without a license. The sedan driver was wearing a helmet, but no other contributing factors were specified. The impact caused significant damage to the sedan's right side doors and the moped's front end.

Riders face dead batteries, empty docks, and mounting frustration. The city promised a pilot last year. Still, the streets wait. The delay leaves e-bike users stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On February 29, 2024, Council Member Erik Bottcher called out the Department of Transportation and Con Edison for failing to deliver electrified Citi Bike docks in his Manhattan district. The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the creation of a residential parking permit system in Northwestern Brooklyn," directs the Department of Transportation to create a permit system for local parking. Council Members Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, and Lynn C. Schulman back the measure. The bill was referred to committee on the day of introduction.
