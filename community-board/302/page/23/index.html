The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world.

The bill, titled "A Local Law in relation to establishing a task force on vehicles registered out-of-state," calls for an interagency group—DOT, NYPD, Finance, plus mayoral and council appointees—to study the prevalence of out-of-state vehicle registrations in New York City. Sponsors include Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Robert F. Holden, Gale A. Brewer, Amanda Farías, James F. Gennaro, and Lincoln Restler. The task force has one year to investigate and report to the Mayor and Council Speaker. The bill aims to expose registration loopholes and recommend solutions, but for now, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—remain at risk as enforcement and accountability lag.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The e-bike rider was traveling east, going straight ahead, when the vehicle traveling north made a right turn and impacted the rider at the center front end of the bike and the left front bumper of the vehicle. The rider sustained contusions and bruises to the knee, lower leg, and foot but was not ejected and remained conscious. Vehicle damage was noted as "Other," while the e-bike showed no damage. No victim behaviors were listed as contributing factors in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The proposal, which must pass the city's Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) and City Council, follows the company's past opposition to the McGuinness Boulevard safety redesign and bike lanes on Monitor Street. The matter summary states the company wants 'safe access between production facilities.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, who supported the McGuinness safety overhaul, was not informed of the plan and said, 'public land should be for the public.' Broadway Stages president Gina Argento argued bike lanes would be unsafe due to truck traffic, despite DOT data showing bike lanes reduce injuries.

The measure remains in committee. The bill responds to a fatal flaw: 'We have no mechanism right now, under law, to crack down on extremely reckless drivers,' said Brooklyn State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The current law lets drivers rack up dozens of camera tickets and keep driving, since no points are added to licenses. Gianaris’s bill aims to close this loophole. DOT and crash victims’ families, including Juliane Williams, whose daughter was killed by a speeding driver, press for stronger penalties and expansion of the red light camera program. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired with little effect. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while repeat offenders face few real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
