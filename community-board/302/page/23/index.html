An SUV sat stopped in traffic. A sedan drove straight. The right‑rear passenger was crushed. She did not make it. That was 11:04 p.m. on February 28. The city logged it as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4795527</a>.</p><p>Two more riders died on the BQE. One at 9:58 p.m. on May 10. A motorcycle hit the back of a slowing sedan. The rider died at the scene. The state called it <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4812048</a>. Another at 1:57 a.m. on July 3. A 55‑year‑old was ejected.

She was not at an intersection. An SUV going west hit her. She died on May 17.

The names repeat in police logs. The pain repeats in families.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-bites>Where the street bites</h3><p>The BQE is the worst line on the map here: 309 injuries and three deaths since 2022. That is the top hotspot, stamped in the data as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>BROOKLYN QUEENS EXPRESSWAY</a>. Tillary Street follows with 58 injuries and four serious injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Fulton Street</a> shows 109 injuries.</p><p>The clock doesn’t help. Injuries stack up in the afternoon. From 1 p.m. through 5 p.m., the files show nine deaths and hundreds hurt, with a spike at 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. The hourly curve is in the board’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>distribution</a>.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hit>Who gets hit</h3><p>People outside cars carry the damage. Pedestrians: 490 injuries, 17 serious, two deaths. Cyclists: 494 injuries, 16 serious. Motorized micromobility adds another 123 injuries and three serious injuries. Cars and SUVs still drive most of the harm to walkers: sedans account for 170 pedestrian injuries; SUVs for 133.

The board’s council member, Lincoln Restler, has pressed bills to keep space clear and kids safer near schools. A resolution he sponsors would let a state bill ticket owners when cameras catch parking rule violations. It aims to stop the crosswalk and bike‑lane blockers that force people into traffic. The text sits in <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Res 1024‑2025</a>. The measure “calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5440.” That is the council’s record.</p><p>He also co‑sponsors a bill to force DOT to install school‑zone safety devices within 60 days of a study. The title is <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353‑2025</a>. Another bill he leads would revoke placards for obscured plates. The listings are on the same <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council site</a>.</p><h3 id=what-albany-moved>What Albany moved</h3><p>Speed cameras will stay on through 2030. The governor signed the reauthorization on June 30. “Speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” she said. That’s in the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog report</a>. AMNY covered the same extension and noted the sponsors. Read it here: <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>renewed through 2030</a>.</p><p>In the Senate, lawmakers advanced a bill to clamp repeat speeders with intelligent speed assistance. Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes in committee. So did Senator Andrew Gounardes. The bill is <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. The committee records are linked on that page.</p><h3 id=what-must-change-on-these-blocks>What must change on these blocks</h3><ul><li>Daylight the corners on Fulton, Tillary, and Flatbush. Clear the sightlines that hide people in the crosswalk.</li><li>Harden the turns where drivers cut close. Protect walkers and cyclists at the apexes.</li><li>Target repeat hotspots on the BQE feeders with automated and manual enforcement during the peak injury hours listed above.</li></ul><p>These are small fixes. They keep bones intact.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The cost of delay</h3><p>Police and press keep writing the same lines in other parts of the city. “A driver struck and killed a 47‑year‑old pedestrian… then left the scene,” police said in Bushwick this month. That man was found dead in the road. The driver was gone. Read the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>Daily News</a> and <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Gothamist</a> coverage.</p><p>The pattern is not special. It is routine. It is ours.</p><h3 id=slow-it-down-citywide>Slow it down, citywide</h3><p>Albany renewed cameras. The Council is pushing to clear lanes and speed up school‑zone fixes. The state bill to force speed limiters on repeat offenders is moving. These steps cut risk for people on foot and on bikes. Pair them with a lower default speed limit and targeted fixes at BQE ramps, Fulton, Tillary, and Flatbush. Fewer sirens. Fewer vigils.</p><p>One call helps.

The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution. The program’s future remains uncertain, with vulnerable road users facing continued risk from unchecked car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No replacement for the lost $1 billion. Transit riders and street users face uncertainty. Lawmakers call the move reckless. The city waits. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
