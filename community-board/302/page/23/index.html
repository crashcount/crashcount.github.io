Forty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand four hundred ninety-three hurt. These are not just numbers. They are lives ended or broken since 2022. The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Fulton Street, a 45-year-old passenger killed at Flatbush and State, and a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike at Tillary and Jay. The pain does not fade. It spreads.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Sedans and SUVs alone account for over 340 pedestrian injuries, including 12 serious injuries and 2 deaths. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and motorcycles injure too, but the body count is lower. The street is a gauntlet for the old, the young, the careful, and the quick.</p><h3 id=the-voices-of-loss>The Voices of Loss</h3><p>After the crash on Fulton Street, there were no words from the victim. Only the record: &ldquo;Crush Injuries. Apparent Death.&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A neighbor, after two men died in a hit-and-run, said it plain: <strong>&ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>CBS New York</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. <strong>Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes to extend school speed zones, improving child pedestrian safety</strong>. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>. He also backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat offenders to install speed limiters. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>.</p><p>But the carnage continues. <strong>One vote does not build a crosswalk. One bill does not slow a car barreling down Flatbush.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The cameras are up, but the deaths go on.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking.</strong> Every day of delay is another life at risk. The street does not forgive. Neither should we.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the driver was unlicensed and failed to yield the right-of-way. The impact broke the woman’s hip and caused severe lacerations, leaving her conscious but immobilized on the pavement. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. The collision occurred when the sedan’s right front bumper hit the pedestrian, who was in the crosswalk. No evidence in the report suggests any pedestrian error contributed to the crash.
