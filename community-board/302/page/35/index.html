An SUV crushes her. She dies on the street. Her name is not in the headlines. She is one of twelve killed in Brooklyn CB2 since 2022. Forty-two more have been left with serious injuries. Some will never walk again. Some will never speak. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-relentless>The Pattern Is Relentless</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed two, left 12 with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all add to the toll. No one is safe. Not the child on a bike. Not the old man crossing the street. Not the woman waiting for the light. The disaster moves slow, but it never stops.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Local leaders have talked about safety. They have sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, to speed up protected bike lanes, to require daylighting at intersections. But the pace is slow. The bills sit in committee. The danger does not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a> after a recent hit-and-run. The driver fled. The city keeps counting the dead.</p><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson and Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest have backed safety bills. But the streets are still deadly. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done so. <strong>&ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said a neighbor</a>. The city has not listened.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand daylight at every corner. Do not wait for another body in the street. Do not let them wait, either.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Holden with co-sponsors including Ariola, Riley, Yeger, Restler, Brooks-Powers, Hanks, Borelli, Carr, Kagan, Vernikov, and Paladino. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects. While it aims to protect emergency access, advocates warn it could delay or block street redesigns that save lives for people walking and biking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At a rally, Restler said, "It is wrong how deadly this strip is." The officials demand mid-block crossings, daylighted intersections, raised crosswalks, curb extensions, and safer pedestrian space near BQE ramps. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized city resistance to reallocating street space, saying, "They drag their feet because they don’t want to do the inevitable." The Department of Transportation has agreed only to study new crosswalks. The bill is not yet formal legislation but marks a push for action after years of delay.

The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.'

The bill required the Department of Transportation to post details of all traffic control device and speed reducer requests on a public website. The matter summary reads: 'The required website would include, but need not be limited to, the following information: case number, general topic, issue, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial of traffic control device, and if approved, the timeline for completion.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by 21 co-sponsors including Williams, Hanif, and Yeger. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided, but the measure aimed to end secrecy around life-saving street changes.

High-crash intersections must be prioritized unless deemed infeasible. DOT must also install physical daylighting features, such as planters or bike corrals, where possible. Council Member Farah N.
