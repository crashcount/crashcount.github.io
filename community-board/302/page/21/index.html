Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,300 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue. Each crash is a life ended or broken. Each is a story cut short.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> They killed two people and injured more than 300 on foot. Trucks and buses added to the toll. Bikes and e-bikes hurt dozens, but the deadliest threat rolled on four wheels. The numbers are plain: the street is not safe for the unprotected.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world. She made me a better person, a better man,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>said James Cifuni</a> after his pregnant wife was run down and killed in Brooklyn. &ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same.&rdquo;</p><p>On another street, a bus pinned an 87-year-old man under its wheels. He was just standing near the corner when the driver turned and hit him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Police said officers who responded to the scene discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus at East 12th Street and Avenue Z in Sheepshead Bay around 6:40 p.m.</a></p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every stalled bill, every unprotected crosswalk, every ignored speed limit is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes that do not disappear.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
