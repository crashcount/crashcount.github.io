Forty-two seriously hurt.</strong> That is the cost on Brooklyn CB2 streets since 2022. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last year alone, five lives ended and ten more were shattered by injuries that will not heal. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons, and daughters.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a woman was crushed at the corner of Fulton and Washington. She was 55. She died in the street, struck by an SUV.

The street is not safe for the slow or the small.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have voted to extend school speed zones and back bills to curb repeat speeders. Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Jabari Brisport</a> and Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/57/>Phara Souffrant Forrest</a> both voted yes to extend speed cameras in school zones. The law is clear: &ldquo;improving child pedestrian safety.&rdquo;</p><p>But the carnage continues. The cameras catch speeders, but the city has not lowered the default speed limit to 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers—those with a record of tickets—still roam free. The bills are on the table. The bodies are on the street.</p><h3 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h3><p>A neighbor, after a hit-and-run, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said it plain</a>: &ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</p><p>A relative, after a woman was killed by a car, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

The law’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to tracking progress made towards the requirements of the streets master plan.' It forces transparency on protected bike lanes, bus lanes, pedestrian signals, and upgrades. The public will see delays, costs, and status. No more secrets.
