Since 2022, <strong>12 people have died</strong>. <strong>Forty-two more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful. They only count the bodies.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a woman was crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. She was 55. She died on the street, not at an intersection, not in a crosswalk—just in the path of a machine built heavier and faster than any human body could bear. The city logs her as another statistic. The street remains the same.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>A 74-year-old man was killed at Tillary and Jay, thrown from his e-bike by a turning bus. The record says &ldquo;crush injuries.&rdquo; It does not say who waited for him at home. It does not say what was left behind.</p><p>A cyclist’s arm was severed by a car door on Flatbush. A child’s knee was shattered by a driver who failed to yield. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by a city that moves too slow to protect its own.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Council Member <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. The city is daylighting intersections and building more bike lanes. But the pace is glacial. Each delay is paid in flesh.</p><p>Some bills claim to help but shift the burden to those already at risk. Enforcement falls hardest on cyclists and delivery workers, not the drivers who kill. The street stays dangerous. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and hold reckless drivers to account. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not excuses.</strong></p><p>The street will not change itself. The blood on the asphalt is a message. It is written in the names we forget. Do not let it be written again.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill pushes agencies to publish clear guidance. Streets built for cars alone kill. This bill aims to force change at the blueprint.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill 324 was introduced on January 1, 2025, and is in the sponsorship stage. The bill sits in the New York State Assembly, with Didi Barrett as the primary sponsor and a long list of co-sponsors, including Rebecca Seawright, Amy Paulin, and others. The bill summary reads: 'Requires the consideration of complete street design for certain transportation projects which receive federal or state funding; authorizes the department to compile and make publicly available guidance and reference material related to consideration of complete street design.' This measure would require state and federally funded transportation projects to consider designs that protect all road users, not just drivers. The bill’s broad sponsorship signals growing support for safer, more inclusive streets.

Multiple vehicles traveling south were stopped in traffic when the collision happened. The report identifies 'Following Too Closely' as the primary contributing factor leading to the crash. A 48-year-old male driver, restrained by a lap belt and conscious after the incident, suffered a head injury and concussion. The vehicles involved included a 2024 BMW sedan, a 2012 Nissan sedan, and a 2022 Toyota SUV. The point of impact was primarily at the center back end and rear bumpers, indicating a rear-end collision sequence. The driver errors cited focus on the failure to maintain safe distance, which triggered the chain-reaction crash.

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike. The bill has not yet received a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
