Forty-two more suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five families lost someone forever. Seven hundred twenty-seven people were hurt. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty chairs, and phone calls that never come.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The carnage does not pause. On February 28, a woman died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue. On May 17, a 55-year-old woman was crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. On November 6, a 74-year-old man was killed by a bus and e-bike at Tillary and Jay. The list goes on. <strong>Most victims are people walking, cycling, or just trying to cross the street.</strong></p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines for people on foot. She also backed the SAFE Streets Act, which would force the city to redesign dangerous intersections. But these bills are still waiting for a vote. <strong>&ldquo;Completion of the Queens Boulevard redesign has reduced fatalities by 68% since work began in 2015,&rdquo;</strong> the city <a href="https://www.amny.com/news/dot-completion-of-queens-boulevard-redesign/#:~:text=phase%20of%20the%20Queens%20Boulevard,since%20work%20began%20in%202015">admits</a>. The lesson is clear: redesign saves lives, delay kills.</p><p>Some progress is real. <strong>Speed cameras now run 24/7 in school zones</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/24/hochul-signs-speed-camera-bill-citing-streetsblogs-coverage-of-unsafe-school-streets>Streetsblog NYC</a>). But loopholes remain. Drivers with dozens of tickets keep their keys. The bills to stop repeat speeders—like the Stop Super Speeders Act—are still stuck in Albany.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on bills that force redesign and stop repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the resolution, joined by Brannan, Menin, Louis, Yeger, Hanif, Hudson, Marte, Joseph, Riley, and Brooks-Powers. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Only 117 out of 493 subway stations are accessible. The Council’s action highlights the city’s failure to guarantee safe, equal passage for all riders. Elevators and upgrades are overdue.
