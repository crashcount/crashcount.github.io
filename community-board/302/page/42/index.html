An SUV crushes her. She dies on the street. Her name is not in the headlines. She is one of twelve killed in Brooklyn CB2 since 2022. Forty-two more have been left with serious injuries. Some will never walk again. Some will never speak. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-relentless>The Pattern Is Relentless</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed two, left 12 with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all add to the toll. No one is safe. Not the child on a bike. Not the old man crossing the street. Not the woman waiting for the light. The disaster moves slow, but it never stops.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Local leaders have talked about safety. They have sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, to speed up protected bike lanes, to require daylighting at intersections. But the pace is slow. The bills sit in committee. The danger does not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a> after a recent hit-and-run. The driver fled. The city keeps counting the dead.</p><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson and Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest have backed safety bills. But the streets are still deadly. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done so. <strong>&ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said a neighbor</a>. The city has not listened.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand daylight at every corner. Do not wait for another body in the street. Do not let them wait, either.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Cameras miss them. Streets stay dangerous. Senator Gounardes pushes a bill to pay citizens for reporting illegal plates. Police claim action, but advocates see little change. The bill sits in committee. Ghost cars keep rolling.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill in 2022 to reward citizens who report illegal license plates. The bill remains in committee. The measure would give whistleblowers 25% of the ticket, up to $75. The matter targets drivers who obscure or remove plates to dodge automated enforcement. As city and state agencies rely more on cameras to catch speeders and red-light runners, more drivers hide their plates. The Department of Transportation says cameras failed to ticket over 4% of violators last fall, up from 1% in 2019. Advocates accuse police of lax enforcement and even breaking the law themselves. Gounardes’s bill, still stalled, aims to close this loophole and put power in the hands of citizens. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while enforcement lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter arose after attorney Adam White was arrested for removing plastic from an obscured license plate; charges were later dropped by Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, citing 'insufficient evidence.' The bill, discussed at a press conference, aims to crack down on license plate defacement and illegal parking, which Restler says is rampant among city workers and police. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced a similar bill at the state level. Both lawmakers stress the need for public accountability and tougher enforcement to protect vulnerable road users from drivers who evade responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
