The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world.

The board wants to upgrade the faded painted lane, which runs west to Flatbush Boulevard, to a 'vehicle-protected' lane. The matter summary states: 'bring much-needed road safety to a neighborhood.' Council Members Rita Joseph and Crystal Hudson represent the area. Hudson's spokesperson called the resolution 'a necessary step to protect cyclists and pedestrians.' Joseph and DOT did not comment. Between 2021 and 2023, Empire Boulevard saw 406 crashes, injuring 29 cyclists and 52 pedestrians. Two cyclists and two pedestrians have died since 2011. Community Board 9 has zero miles of protected bike lanes. Advocates say improvements are overdue.

It would allow New York City to mount enforcement cameras on street sweepers to ticket cars parked illegally during street cleaning hours. The bill summary states it 'fulfills the Sanitation Department's longstanding ask for help getting vehicles out of the way of road-cleaning operations.' Cunningham, who sponsors the bill, said, 'Dirty streets are totally unacceptable.' Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch supports the change, noting that state law must allow automated ticketing. Uptown Manhattan State Senator Robert Jackson introduced a similar Senate bill. The law would phase in after a year and expire by mid-2029, giving officials time to assess its impact.

The bill responds to Local Law 12 of 2011, which already mandates a safety plan, but this measure sharpens the focus: DOT must show where agents will be placed to protect the most dangerous corridors.

Karczag faces charges for failure to yield, running a red light, and not exercising due care. The intersection, plagued by 42 injury crashes since 2019, sits near schools and playgrounds. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing the area, offered condolences: "My heart breaks for her family and loved ones." Local activist Brent Bovenzi called for urgent action, saying, "We must have greater safety for our most vulnerable New Yorkers. The city already has the tools to make our intersections safer, we just need the political will to do it." Advocates demand reinstated crossing guards and daylighting. Mayor Adams pledged to daylight 1,000 intersections in 2024, but critics say the pace is glacial.

The DOT claims, 'the revised hours will provide older New Yorkers and people with disabilities better street access while preserving the Open Street during its peak hours.' Council Member Crystal Hudson, a known supporter of livable streets, has not taken a clear stance but is monitoring the situation for safety. The Fort Greene Open Streets Coalition opposes the change, stating, 'Opening the street to vehicles during prime early morning hours and throughout the late evenings as the days grow longer will be an unfortunate mistake, and increases the potential for conflict with street safety impacts.' The coalition also disputes the DOT’s financial rationale, arguing the change will increase city costs due to extra staffing for barricades. The move reflects a broader city trend of reduced support for open streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Oswald Feliz leads as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Bottcher, Gennaro, Marte, Restler, Ung, and Paladino.

Advocates like Kevin Garcia and Sebastian David Baez criticized the city and state for perpetuating unsafe, polluted conditions and sacrificing working-class communities.
