Forty-two have suffered serious injuries.</strong> In just over three years, Brooklyn CB2 has seen 5,209 crashes. The names fade, but the pain does not. A woman, 55, crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. A cyclist, 74, killed by a bus turning at Tillary and Jay. A passenger, 45, gone in a tangle of metal on Flatbush and State. The dead do not get second chances. The living carry scars.</p><p><strong>Most victims are not behind the wheel.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons—<strong>344 pedestrian injuries and deaths from cars and SUVs alone</strong>. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Local leaders have acted, but the pace is slow. <strong>Senator Jabari Brisport and Senator Andrew Gounardes voted yes to extend school speed zones</strong> and to require speed limiters for repeat offenders. These votes matter. They save lives. But the work is not finished. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders still drive. The city can do more. It must.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>said Governor Hochul as she signed the renewal into law</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. <strong>&ldquo;Our message to drivers was clear: follow the rules or face the law,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch</a>. The message is clear. The streets are not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, and those who hold power. The dead cannot speak. The living must. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat offenders.</strong> Join the fight. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><hr><p><strong>Act now.

The program, covering 750 school zones, needs state approval before June. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls speed cameras 'one of the most effective tools' to stop deadly driving. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who sponsored the last reauthorization, says, 'my bill to expand the speed camera program has saved lives.' The city wants stronger penalties for repeat offenders and action on license plate fraud, which lets millions of violations go unpunished. The report shows cameras cut speeding by 94 percent and reduce injuries and deaths. The program faces political hurdles, but the evidence is clear: speed cameras protect people on foot and bike. Lawmakers must decide whether to keep this life-saving tool.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' when a speeding e-bike struck her, causing 'severe lacerations' to her entire body. She remained conscious after the impact. The e-bike operator, described as unlicensed, did not stop at the scene. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The e-bike showed no visible damage. The victim’s action—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but the primary focus remains on the rider’s speed, improper lane usage, and lack of a valid license. The crash underscores the dangers posed by reckless operation and systemic failures to control unlicensed riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
