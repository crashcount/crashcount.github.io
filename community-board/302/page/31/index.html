Forty-two seriously hurt.</strong> That is the cost on Brooklyn CB2 streets since 2022. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last year alone, five lives ended and ten more were shattered by injuries that will not heal. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons, and daughters.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a woman was crushed at the corner of Fulton and Washington. She was 55. She died in the street, struck by an SUV.

The street is not safe for the slow or the small.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have voted to extend school speed zones and back bills to curb repeat speeders. Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Jabari Brisport</a> and Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/57/>Phara Souffrant Forrest</a> both voted yes to extend speed cameras in school zones. The law is clear: &ldquo;improving child pedestrian safety.&rdquo;</p><p>But the carnage continues. The cameras catch speeders, but the city has not lowered the default speed limit to 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers—those with a record of tickets—still roam free. The bills are on the table. The bodies are on the street.</p><h3 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h3><p>A neighbor, after a hit-and-run, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said it plain</a>: &ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</p><p>A relative, after a woman was killed by a car, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

According to the police report, the crash involved three SUVs and one sedan traveling southbound. The primary contributing factor was 'Following Too Closely,' which led to a rear-end impact. One SUV was stopped in traffic, while others were slowing or going straight ahead. Both injured drivers were restrained with lap belts and harnesses and suffered neck injuries, including whiplash and complaints of pain or nausea. The report notes the drivers were not ejected and experienced shock. No pedestrian or cyclist involvement was reported.

Announced February 6, 2024, the bill would require transportation officials to align projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes said, "We fundamentally want to be shifting how we think about transportation infrastructure." The measure responds to data showing over 90 percent of infrastructure funds go to roads, not transit. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance called for an "about-face," noting highway projects have torn apart poor communities and endangered pedestrians and cyclists. The bill sits before the state legislature. No direct safety analyst assessment, but advocates stress the law would shift funding from car-centric projects to transit and greenways, reducing systemic danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill requiring New York to reduce vehicle miles traveled by 20 percent by 2050. The bill, modeled after Minnesota law, is not yet passed or assigned to a committee. It would amend the state’s climate law, forcing transportation officials to align highway projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes warns, 'If we’re just going to use that money to double down on the transportation of the past, on just purely automobile usage, we’re making a great mistake.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit. The measure would require revisions or offsets for projects that don’t cut driving. Gov. Hochul’s office declined comment.

Signals, ramps, and paint force drivers to slow. Pedestrians gain a fighting chance on Brooklyn’s deadliest stretch. Local leaders push for more. The city’s hand finally moves after years of blood.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced new mid-block pedestrian crossings on Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn’s so-called 'Boulevard of Death.' The crossings, between Nevins and Bond, Bond and Hoyt, and Hoyt and Smith streets, add crosswalks, traffic lights, and ramps. Restler said, 'These new mid-block crossings will create a greater sense of safety and community for Boerum Hill.' The Department of Transportation acted after Restler and others demanded change following the death of Katherine Harris, killed by a speeding driver. DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks. Leaders want more: curb extensions, redesigned crossings, and further traffic calming. Atlantic Avenue remains a battleground for the city’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
