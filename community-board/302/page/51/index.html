The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world.

The sky remains loud.</p><p class=mb3>On December 12, 2022, the New York City Council, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, introduced a bill to ban non-essential helicopter flights from city heliports. The bill, discussed in oversight hearings, remains stalled. The matter summary states: 'Noise complaints from helicopters over New York City have soared in recent years, but lawmakers at city, state, and federal levels have failed to significantly reduce non-essential helicopter flights.' Restler declared, 'This isn't just a quality of life issue — it's about climate justice. 1 helicopter idling is the equivalent of 40 cars!' Council Member Gale Brewer and State Senator Brad Hoylman joined calls for action. Despite advocacy and testimony from residents, significant policy changes have not passed. The Federal Aviation Administration’s authority blocks local control. Helicopter noise and pollution continue to harm New Yorkers, especially in vulnerable neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Civilians who report violations receive 25% of collected fines. The measure has 26 co-sponsors, a council majority. Restler introduced the bill to address what he calls a 'public safety risk' from illegal parking: 'These cars illegally obstruct pedestrian space, endanger cyclists, and block accessibility.' He stresses, 'The point of Intro 501 is to effectively deter dangerous parking that block bike lanes, bus lanes and sidewalks—not to generate revenue.'

The matter summary reads: 'A proposed City Council bill would let civilians report cars illegally and unsafely parked in crosswalks and bike lanes and then collect 25 percent of the resulting ticket fees.' Restler is the lead sponsor. In a published opinion, critics argue the bill creates conflict, erodes trust, and places the burden of enforcement on vulnerable road users. The statement warns, 'By devolving responsibility for street safety to cyclists and pedestrians, Restler abdicates the role of government and places the burden—and by extension, the blame—back on the victims.' The piece calls for systemic design changes, not citizen-led enforcement, to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say it pits neighbors against each other and dodges real fixes. Streets stay deadly for walkers and cyclists. The city stalls on bold action.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 501, introduced by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg), proposes letting civilians report cars illegally parked in crosswalks and bike lanes, collecting 25 percent of ticket fees. The bill draws fire in a December 6, 2022 Streetsblog opinion, which warns, 'turning citizens against one another, even in the name of pedestrian safety, is a terrible mistake.' The writer opposes both citizen and NYPD enforcement, urging proven street design instead. The piece notes, 'Bills like Intro 501 further the trend toward mutual mistrust... by creating a narc economy.' Restler and co-sponsors are criticized for supporting increased NYPD budgets while sidestepping systemic solutions. The bill’s intent is clear: empower vulnerable road users. But the debate exposes deep rifts over how to keep streets safe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In response, the Department of Transportation (DOT) moved to create a pedestrian-only plaza between Vanderbilt Avenue and Fulton Street. Brooklyn Community Board 2 voted against the plan in August 2022, but DOT proceeded, as city law does not require board approval. The matter, described as a response to 'the tragedy and the desire to improve safety,' drew over 1,800 petition signatures. Council Member Crystal Hudson, representing District 35, supported the plaza for safety reasons. Despite public outreach and a scaled-back design, some longtime residents felt ignored. DOT promises further safety improvements.
