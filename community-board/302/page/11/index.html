The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world.

The policy, set by Mayor Adams and the City Council, bans curbside dining from November 29 through March, returning the space to private car parking. The Department of Transportation warned the pizzeria it could face fines for serving customers from a parked school bus. Council Member Lincoln Restler called it 'unfortunate that city policy returned this curbside space to parking or vehicle storage rather than more dynamic uses like outdoor dining.' Advocates and business owners, including Zafer Sevimcok and Beatrice Tosti di Valminuta, criticized the ban. The number of restaurants in the permanent outdoor dining program has dropped due to fees and winter restrictions. The city’s move prioritizes car storage over safe, public space for people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Robert Holden, claims to address a 'public safety crisis.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the measure, stating, 'The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal [cycling] behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.' Rodriguez cited data: 105 pedestrians killed by cars this year, versus six by e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters combined. He argued that street redesigns, not new bureaucracy, cut deaths and injuries. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams echoed this, noting that registration backers often resist proven safety fixes like protected bike lanes. Rodriguez warned the bill would waste $19 million and slow adoption of sustainable transport. He called for holding delivery apps accountable and redesigning streets, not targeting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Economic Development Corporation, which manages the heliport, seeks to allow more flights if 50 percent use electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), pending FAA approval. The matter summary states: 'The city could lift a years-old cap on helicopter trips at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in order to get companies to pivot to electric aircraft.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing Brooklyn waterfront neighborhoods, criticized the plan and called for a ban on non-essential tourism and luxury air taxi flights. Restler previously introduced legislation to ban such trips, but it failed. Advocates Melissa Elstein and Andrew Rosenthal of Stop The Chop also oppose the plan, citing noise, quality of life, and expanded luxury service. The contract includes expanded lounges and segregated passenger flows, which advocates see as a move to boost luxury air travel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city is conducting a Department of Transportation traffic study, but residents remain skeptical. The DUMBO Business Improvement District president urged better enforcement of vending laws.
