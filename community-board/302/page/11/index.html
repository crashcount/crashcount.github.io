Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,300 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue. Each crash is a life ended or broken. Each is a story cut short.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> They killed two people and injured more than 300 on foot. Trucks and buses added to the toll. Bikes and e-bikes hurt dozens, but the deadliest threat rolled on four wheels. The numbers are plain: the street is not safe for the unprotected.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world. She made me a better person, a better man,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>said James Cifuni</a> after his pregnant wife was run down and killed in Brooklyn. &ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same.&rdquo;</p><p>On another street, a bus pinned an 87-year-old man under its wheels. He was just standing near the corner when the driver turned and hit him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Police said officers who responded to the scene discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus at East 12th Street and Avenue Z in Sheepshead Bay around 6:40 p.m.</a></p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every stalled bill, every unprotected crosswalk, every ignored speed limit is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes that do not disappear.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Key actions included the City Council decriminalizing jaywalking and cutting mandatory parking minimums, though low-density areas were left out. Council Member Lincoln Restler lost his Transportation Committee seat despite pushing for citizen enforcement against illegal parking. Speaker Adrienne Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Mayor Adams were all named for missed promises or weak follow-through. Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch’s crackdown on ghost plates drew praise. The review called out Gov. Hochul for delaying congestion pricing, then reversing course.

Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets.

Advocates and business owners, including Zafer Sevimcok and Beatrice Tosti di Valminuta, criticized the ban.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the measure, stating, 'The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal [cycling] behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.' Rodriguez cited data: 105 pedestrians killed by cars this year, versus six by e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters combined. He argued that street redesigns, not new bureaucracy, cut deaths and injuries. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams echoed this, noting that registration backers often resist proven safety fixes like protected bike lanes.

They demand a ban on non-essential, luxury air travel.</p><p class=mb3>On December 9, 2024, the city released a draft contract proposing to lift the cap on helicopter flights at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport. The Economic Development Corporation, which manages the heliport, seeks to allow more flights if 50 percent use electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), pending FAA approval. The matter summary states: 'The city could lift a years-old cap on helicopter trips at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in order to get companies to pivot to electric aircraft.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing Brooklyn waterfront neighborhoods, criticized the plan and called for a ban on non-essential tourism and luxury air taxi flights. Restler previously introduced legislation to ban such trips, but it failed. Advocates Melissa Elstein and Andrew Rosenthal of Stop The Chop also oppose the plan, citing noise, quality of life, and expanded luxury service. The contract includes expanded lounges and segregated passenger flows, which advocates see as a move to boost luxury air travel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Holden calls it betrayal. Poll shows narrow support. Some see a cash grab, others hope for better transit. The $9 fee hits drivers. The city waits for the impact.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2024, the MTA approved congestion pricing, set to start January 5, 2025. The plan charges $9 for cars and $14.40 for trucks entering Manhattan below 60th Street. amNew York Metro polled nearly 3,000 residents: 53.8% support, 44.9% oppose. The matter, titled 'Here’s how New Yorkers really feel about congestion pricing,' reveals sharp divides. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) condemned the move, calling it a 'blatant political move and a shameless betrayal of New Yorkers.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the plan, citing needed transit upgrades. The bill’s impact on vulnerable road users was not assessed. The debate centers on funding transit versus burdening drivers. The city stands at a crossroads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
