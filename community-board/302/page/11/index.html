Forty-two seriously hurt.</strong> In just over three years, Brooklyn CB2 has seen 5,209 crashes. The numbers are blunt, but the pain is sharp. A woman, 55, crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. A cyclist, 74, thrown from his e-bike and killed at Tillary and Jay. A child’s knee shattered by a turning car. These are not numbers. These are lives, ended or changed forever.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—<strong>344 crashes</strong> with 2 deaths and 12 serious injuries. Trucks and buses struck 60 people. Bikes, too, are not spared: 40 crashes, 1 serious injury. The street does not care who you are. It only matters who is heavier, who is faster, who walks away.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Local leaders have pushed for change. Council Member <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed protected bike lanes. Senator <a href=/senate-district/25/>Jabari Brisport</a> and Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/57/>Phara Souffrant Forrest</a> have backed safety bills. But the pace is slow. The city has started daylighting intersections, but too many corners remain blind. <strong>Every delay is a risk. Every stalled bill is another family waiting for news at the hospital.</strong></p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A single quote can cut deeper than any number. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very heartbroken. He was a good person&mldr; He wanted to earn things on his own,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-men-crossing-brooklyn-street/>said Qin Xiao Chen</a> after her loved one was killed crossing the street. &ldquo;These two deaths are as horrifying as they were preventable,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-pedestrians-on-third-ave-corridor-eric-adams-refuses-to-make-safer>said Ben Furnas</a> after another crash. The grief is endless. The cause is not a mystery.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, not promises. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The new proposal drops the peak toll from $15 to $9. The plan’s status is pending, with urgency to implement before a new presidential administration. Gounardes stressed, “It’s more important than ever that we start congestion pricing immediately, before Trump can block it.” The bill aims to fund the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan, but economist Charles Komanoff warns, “You don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.” The measure is meant to reduce traffic and improve transit, but the lower toll means less impact. The MTA has already paused $16 billion in work. The focus is on starting the program, but advocates note the diluted toll will not deliver the same safety and quality-of-life gains for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

"The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now."" -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On November 8, 2024, Governor Hochul proposed lowering New York City’s congestion pricing toll from $15 to $9. The plan, a policy proposal to adjust congestion pricing, comes as officials rush to implement it before a new presidential administration can intervene. The original $15 toll, crafted by the Traffic Mobility Review Board and approved by the MTA Board, promised strong traffic reduction and included credits and caps. The $9 version, previously reviewed in environmental assessments, may lack those protections. Economist Charles Komanoff warns, 'You lose other benefits. Most noticeably, you don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes urges swift action, saying, 'The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now.' The lower toll is projected to improve traffic speeds by only 6.4 percent, far less than the 17 percent expected from the original plan. With less traffic reduction, streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
