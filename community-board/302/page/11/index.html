An SUV crushes her. She dies on the street. Her name is not in the headlines. She is one of twelve killed in Brooklyn CB2 since 2022. Forty-two more have been left with serious injuries. Some will never walk again. Some will never speak. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-relentless>The Pattern Is Relentless</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed two, left 12 with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all add to the toll. No one is safe. Not the child on a bike. Not the old man crossing the street. Not the woman waiting for the light. The disaster moves slow, but it never stops.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Local leaders have talked about safety. They have sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, to speed up protected bike lanes, to require daylighting at intersections. But the pace is slow. The bills sit in committee. The danger does not wait.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a> after a recent hit-and-run. The driver fled. The city keeps counting the dead.</p><p>Council Member Crystal Hudson and Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest have backed safety bills. But the streets are still deadly. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done so. <strong>&ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said a neighbor</a>. The city has not listened.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand daylight at every corner. Do not wait for another body in the street. Do not let them wait, either.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The new proposal drops the peak toll from $15 to $9. The plan’s status is pending, with urgency to implement before a new presidential administration. Gounardes stressed, “It’s more important than ever that we start congestion pricing immediately, before Trump can block it.” The bill aims to fund the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan, but economist Charles Komanoff warns, “You don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.” The measure is meant to reduce traffic and improve transit, but the lower toll means less impact. The MTA has already paused $16 billion in work. The focus is on starting the program, but advocates note the diluted toll will not deliver the same safety and quality-of-life gains for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

"The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now."" -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On November 8, 2024, Governor Hochul proposed lowering New York City’s congestion pricing toll from $15 to $9. The plan, a policy proposal to adjust congestion pricing, comes as officials rush to implement it before a new presidential administration can intervene. The original $15 toll, crafted by the Traffic Mobility Review Board and approved by the MTA Board, promised strong traffic reduction and included credits and caps. The $9 version, previously reviewed in environmental assessments, may lack those protections. Economist Charles Komanoff warns, 'You lose other benefits. Most noticeably, you don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes urges swift action, saying, 'The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now.' The lower toll is projected to improve traffic speeds by only 6.4 percent, far less than the 17 percent expected from the original plan. With less traffic reduction, streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
