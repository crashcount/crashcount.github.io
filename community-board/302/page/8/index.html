Forty-two have suffered serious injuries.</strong> In just over three years, Brooklyn CB2 has seen 5,209 crashes. The names fade, but the pain does not. A woman, 55, crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. A cyclist, 74, killed by a bus turning at Tillary and Jay. A passenger, 45, gone in a tangle of metal on Flatbush and State. The dead do not get second chances. The living carry scars.</p><p><strong>Most victims are not behind the wheel.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons—<strong>344 pedestrian injuries and deaths from cars and SUVs alone</strong>. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Local leaders have acted, but the pace is slow. <strong>Senator Jabari Brisport and Senator Andrew Gounardes voted yes to extend school speed zones</strong> and to require speed limiters for repeat offenders. These votes matter. They save lives. But the work is not finished. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders still drive. The city can do more. It must.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>said Governor Hochul as she signed the renewal into law</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. <strong>&ldquo;Our message to drivers was clear: follow the rules or face the law,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch</a>. The message is clear. The streets are not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, and those who hold power. The dead cannot speak. The living must. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat offenders.</strong> Join the fight. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><hr><p><strong>Act now.

The article, 'Monday’s Headlines: NYPD Bike Crackdown Edition,' revealed that the crackdown would sweep 14 corridors across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the policy 'incredibly misguided' and 'unacceptable.' MSNBC’s Chris Hayes called it 'outrageous' and warned it targets immigrant delivery cyclists. The New York Civil Liberties Union warned of amplified racially targeted policing. The safety analyst notes: 'Criminalizing common cycling violations places undue burdens on cyclists, discourages cycling, and may reduce mode shift, ultimately undermining safety in numbers and street equity for vulnerable road users.' No council bill or committee action is involved, but the crackdown stands as a systemic threat to cyclists and street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Families of crash victims and advocates rally behind the move. The bill targets drivers with six or more tickets. Support grows after deadly crashes.</p><p class=mb3>On April 30, 2025, Council Member Yusef Salaam, Chair of the Committee on Public Safety, introduced a City Council resolution supporting New York State Senate Bill S7621. The bill, now pending, would let courts require drivers with six or more automated speeding tickets in a year to install speed limiter devices. Salaam’s resolution, co-sponsored by five council members, urges Albany to act. The matter title: 'Council Member Yusef Salaam Throws Support Behind Albany Push To Rein In Speeding Drivers.' Salaam said, 'It's very simple: it's to save lives.' The hearing drew families of crash victims and advocates like Amy Cohen and Darnell Sealy-McCrorey, who lost loved ones to reckless drivers. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and other officials back the measure. Salaam’s leadership signals growing momentum for the first bill of its kind in the country.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Officers first noticed the vehicle due to stolen plates and tried to pull it over on Cropsey Avenue. The driver fled, leading police to set up a blockade. As the car tried to pass, an officer fired one round, striking the driver. The wounded man crashed into a police car and was later pronounced dead at Brookdale Hospital. The passenger was unharmed and taken into custody. The incident highlights the risks of high-speed chases and roadblocks in dense urban areas, where bystanders and officers face sudden danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Data shows Black drivers face more searches and arrests. NYPD blamed crime patterns. Lawmakers called it an excuse. The city’s history of biased policing loomed large.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2025, the City Council held an oversight hearing on NYPD traffic enforcement and racial bias. Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue.
