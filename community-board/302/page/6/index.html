A Ford Explorer hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;The driver of the Ford Explorer sped off without stopping, stunned witnesses told police.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A week before, a motorcyclist died on the BQE. The driver he hit was unlicensed, driving without a court-ordered ignition lock. Police made an arrest. The dead man’s name was Sean Johnson. He was 27. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bqe-traffic-collision-arrest-05102025/>&ldquo;Police arrested 44-year-old Laura Cordova&mldr; for driving without a license and using a vehicle without ignition interlock.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A woman stepped out of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

Ten more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Over 1,400 crashes in the past year.</strong> Nearly 700 people hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home. Cars and SUVs killed two. Trucks and buses left bodies broken. Bikes and mopeds added to the toll. The dead do not care about the type of vehicle. The living must.</p><h3 id=leaders-speak-but-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Speak, But Streets Stay Deadly</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero.

The city has the power to lower speed limits now. It has the power to keep cameras running. It has the power to act. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.
