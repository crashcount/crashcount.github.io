Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,300 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue. Each crash is a life ended or broken. Each is a story cut short.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> They killed two people and injured more than 300 on foot. Trucks and buses added to the toll. Bikes and e-bikes hurt dozens, but the deadliest threat rolled on four wheels. The numbers are plain: the street is not safe for the unprotected.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world. She made me a better person, a better man,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>said James Cifuni</a> after his pregnant wife was run down and killed in Brooklyn. &ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same.&rdquo;</p><p>On another street, a bus pinned an 87-year-old man under its wheels. He was just standing near the corner when the driver turned and hit him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Police said officers who responded to the scene discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus at East 12th Street and Avenue Z in Sheepshead Bay around 6:40 p.m.</a></p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every stalled bill, every unprotected crosswalk, every ignored speed limit is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes that do not disappear.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 28, 2025, the City Council’s Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises held a hearing on the future of Atlantic Avenue. The Department of Transportation (DOT) declined to commit to a full redesign of a deadly 13-block stretch, despite pressure from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Chi Ossé. Both made redesign a condition for supporting a major rezoning. The official matter: 'The administration must commit to a fully-funded redesign of Atlantic Avenue from Flatbush Avenue in the west to Nostrand Avenue in the east.' DOT’s Brooklyn Borough Planner, Dash Henley, promised only an 18-month traffic study and minor intersection tweaks, projecting a seven-to-ten-year wait for real change. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso joined calls for traffic calming and lane reallocation. From 2021 to 2024, four people died and 473 were injured here. Advocates and council members want protected bike lanes and road diets. DOT has not committed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency used powers from Sammy's Law, passed last year, to lower speeds in DUMBO (Brooklyn), City Island (Bronx), Broad Channel (Queens), and New Brighton (Staten Island). DOT chose these areas for their heavy pedestrian traffic and clear boundaries. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing DUMBO, praised the move, saying, "I'm pleased that DOT will be implementing Brooklyn's first Regional Slow Zone in DUMBO—a neighborhood densely crowded with pedestrian foot traffic." DOT plans to cut speeds on 250 street segments this year, focusing on schools and shared streets. Research shows lower speed limits reduce injury severity in crashes. Despite this progress, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not brought a citywide 20 mph limit to a vote.

The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
