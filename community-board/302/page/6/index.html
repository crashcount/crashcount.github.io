The dead include a 55-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Washington Avenue, a 74-year-old man thrown from his e-bike and killed by a turning bus at Jay and Tillary, and a 45-year-old woman who died in the back seat of a car on Flatbush Avenue.

Council Members <a href=/council-district/35/>Crystal Hudson</a> and <a href=/council-district/33/>Lincoln Restler</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and require daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not used it. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Tiffany was literally the center of our world. She made me a better person, a better man,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>said James Cifuni</a> after his pregnant wife was run down and killed in Brooklyn. &ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same.&rdquo;</p><p>On another street, a bus pinned an 87-year-old man under its wheels. He was just standing near the corner when the driver turned and hit him. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Police said officers who responded to the scene discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus at East 12th Street and Avenue Z in Sheepshead Bay around 6:40 p.m.</a></p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every stalled bill, every unprotected crosswalk, every ignored speed limit is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes that do not disappear.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees.

Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.'

An e-bike delivery worker flew through a stop sign. The crash was sudden. Cruz died on the street. The rider stayed. The intersection is known for danger. Delivery speed and city policy collide.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on March 23, 2025, that Luis Cruz, 49, died after being struck by an e-bike delivery worker who "sped through a stop sign" at Franklin and India streets in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene; no arrests were made as the investigation continued. The article notes that the intersection is a known trouble spot, with Collins stating, "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The report highlights systemic issues: delivery app pressures, lack of regulation, and a street design that encourages risky moves. City data shows e-bikes account for a small share of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move targets busy pedestrian areas. Advocates and Council Member Restler back the change. Lower speeds mean fewer deadly crashes. Citywide action still stalled.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2025, the NYC Department of Transportation announced four new 20 mph speed limit zones. The agency used powers from Sammy's Law, passed last year, to lower speeds in DUMBO (Brooklyn), City Island (Bronx), Broad Channel (Queens), and New Brighton (Staten Island). DOT chose these areas for their heavy pedestrian traffic and clear boundaries. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing DUMBO, praised the move, saying, "I'm pleased that DOT will be implementing Brooklyn's first Regional Slow Zone in DUMBO—a neighborhood densely crowded with pedestrian foot traffic." DOT plans to cut speeds on 250 street segments this year, focusing on schools and shared streets. Research shows lower speed limits reduce injury severity in crashes. Despite this progress, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not brought a citywide 20 mph limit to a vote. Advocates urge more action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
