Forty-two seriously hurt.</strong> That is the cost on Brooklyn CB2 streets since 2022. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last year alone, five lives ended and ten more were shattered by injuries that will not heal. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons, and daughters.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a woman was crushed at the corner of Fulton and Washington. She was 55. She died in the street, struck by an SUV.

The street is not safe for the slow or the small.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have voted to extend school speed zones and back bills to curb repeat speeders. Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Jabari Brisport</a> and Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/57/>Phara Souffrant Forrest</a> both voted yes to extend speed cameras in school zones. The law is clear: &ldquo;improving child pedestrian safety.&rdquo;</p><p>But the carnage continues. The cameras catch speeders, but the city has not lowered the default speed limit to 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers—those with a record of tickets—still roam free. The bills are on the table. The bodies are on the street.</p><h3 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h3><p>A neighbor, after a hit-and-run, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said it plain</a>: &ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</p><p>A relative, after a woman was killed by a car, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

At a rally, Restler said, "It is wrong how deadly this strip is." The officials demand mid-block crossings, daylighted intersections, raised crosswalks, curb extensions, and safer pedestrian space near BQE ramps. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized city resistance to reallocating street space, saying, "They drag their feet because they don’t want to do the inevitable." The Department of Transportation has agreed only to study new crosswalks. The bill is not yet formal legislation but marks a push for action after years of delay.

The Council now holds the power. Lawmakers stall. Streets stay deadly. Victims’ families and advocates demand action. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, named for 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, would let New York City lower speed limits below 25 mph. The bill failed to enter the 2023 state budget, shifting responsibility to the City Council. In 2021, the Council backed a home rule message 42-6, but the Assembly blocked it. Last year, the Council reversed course and failed to pass the message. This session, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, with 10 sponsors. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers must hold a hearing before a vote. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Brooks-Powers have not signed on, citing negotiations. The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.' Data show slower speeds save lives. Advocates and victims’ families keep pushing. The Council’s inaction keeps streets dangerous.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash left a 38-year-old woman, the sedan driver, with severe arm lacerations. A pickup truck was also struck in the crash. The only contributing factor listed in the data is 'Unsafe Speed.' No other driver errors are noted. The report states, 'The belt held her. The road did not.' The violence of speed left the woman injured and the vehicles mangled. The crash highlights the danger when drivers move too fast for city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
