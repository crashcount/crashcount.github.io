Forty-two seriously injured.</strong> More than 2,400 hurt since 2022. The streets do not forgive. Each number is a body, a family, a life split open. The latest: a 55-year-old woman, crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. A 45-year-old passenger, killed at Flatbush and State. A 74-year-old man, thrown from his e-bike, never to stand again. The list does not end.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>There is no poetry in the aftermath. Only the sound of sirens and the silence that follows. <strong>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo;</strong> said Henry Tziquin, whose father was killed by a hit-and-run driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>in Brooklyn</a>. The pain is not abstract. It is a son searching for his father on the ground, eyes closed, never to open again.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In CB2, they are behind the majority of deaths and serious injuries to people on foot and bike. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll, but the pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—walkers, cyclists, children—pay the price for someone else’s speed, someone else’s mistake.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Council Member Crystal Hudson has co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. The city is daylighting intersections and adding bike lanes, but the pace is slow. <strong>Speed cameras are up, but loopholes remain.</strong> The state renewed the speed camera program, and Senator Andrew Gounardes said, <strong>&ldquo;speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>during the reauthorization</a>. But the dead keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, clear crosswalks, and enforcement that targets the real danger—drivers who kill and flee. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.'

The Department of Transportation will fine violators $650 per incident, using in-road sensors to detect excess weight. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Overweight trucks cause wear and tear on our roadways and we all pay the price through expensive repairs to our infrastructure." The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles. Albany has approved expanding this automated system to more city roadways. The BQE’s aging structure faces risk from trucks exceeding its design limits, raising safety and infrastructure concerns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill passed both the Senate and Assembly and awaits Governor Hochul’s signature. The measure, described as 'possibly the most important street safety law on the books,' covers 750 school zones. Sen. Andrew Gounardes praised the program, saying, 'speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez credited advocates and lawmakers for the renewal. Amy Sohn supported the move. Safety analysts note that speed cameras reduce vehicle speeds and crashes, improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists without burdening them. The reauthorization marks a rare, clear win for vulnerable road users in the city’s ongoing battle against traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city intends to revert to an older, unprotected design after complaints from local residents. Advocates argue the protected lane was installed due to 'years of danger and death,' and that removing it is 'unwarranted, unlawful, reckless.' The lawsuit claims the city failed to conduct required traffic or impact studies before making the change. City Hall says intersections will keep some safety features, but the main stretch will lose its protection. The article highlights persistent double-parking and high injury rates as key dangers.

The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.'

Over 130,000 reckless drivers dodge speed-limiter rules. Only the worst offenders face consequences. Pedestrians and cyclists stay exposed. Lawmakers chose drivers over safety. The city’s deadliest keep rolling. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2025, the New York State Senate amended the Super Speeder Bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes (D-Bay Ridge). The bill originally required drivers with six or more speed or red-light camera tickets in a year to install speed-limiting devices. The Senate raised the threshold to sixteen speed-camera tickets, and removed red-light violations from the count. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'the state Senate moved to help more than 130,000 reckless drivers avoid accountability.' Gounardes defended the change, saying it would allow the program to grow slowly. Assembly Member Michaell Novakhov (R-Midwood) argued the threshold was too low. The amendment means only 17,000 drivers, not 150,000, will face restrictions. According to safety analysts, this move undermines deterrence, increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, and signals that dangerous driving is tolerated. Vulnerable road users remain at risk. The bill’s status now sets a weaker standard for accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
