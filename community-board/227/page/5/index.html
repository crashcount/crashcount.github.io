A Mustang turned, then surged forward. Metal struck flesh. The car plowed into scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran. <strong>&ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. All six landed in the hospital. The street was left with blood and broken beams. No arrests. No answers.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h2><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 116 people were injured and one killed in 112 crashes in Bronx CB27.</strong> Children were among the hurt. Not one serious injury was recorded, but the wounds linger. Over the past three years, seven have died. Three were pedestrians. Most were hit by cars or SUVs. The numbers do not grieve. They only count.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored bills to daylight intersections and add speed humps near parks. He backed the SAFE Streets Act, calling for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. But when it came to Fordham Road, he stood with business owners and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/30/bronx-business-leaders-and-local-institutions-want-to-halt-bus-fixes-on-fordham-rd>blocked a busway</a> that would have protected 85,000 daily riders—many of them walking, many of them at risk. The city passed laws. The street waits for action.</p><h2 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h2><p>After the Mustang hit, panic spread. <strong>&ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The city moved on. The pain stayed.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings, busways, and daylighted corners. Demand that the city stop blaming the people who walk and start protecting them. <strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N.
