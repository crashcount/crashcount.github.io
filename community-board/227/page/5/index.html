First, a road rage assault. Then, an ambulance strikes him as he waits for help. The news calls it an accident. The city calls it a statistic. But the pain is real. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 117 were injured</strong> in crashes across Bronx CB27. No one was spared: children, elders, workers, the young and the old. Seventeen kids were hurt. No one calls to check if they made it home.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h2><p>Since 2022, <strong>seven people have died</strong> on these streets. Three were killed by cars or SUVs. One was a pedestrian, struck and left with nothing but a line in a database. Three others died behind the wheel or on two wheels. <strong>Three suffered serious injuries</strong>—the kind that never leave you.</p><p>The last year saw a drop in deaths, but injuries rose. <strong>Injuries jumped 27%</strong> compared to the year before. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-promises>The Leaders and Their Promises</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. They talk about Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set safer speeds. But talk is not action. The law sits on the table. The speed limit stays high. The cameras wait for reauthorization.</p><p>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has called for a 20 mph limit here. No one has demanded more cameras or safer crossings. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets where children can walk without fear.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, the toll grows.

The bill, advanced by the Senate Transportation Committee, proposes 'new security features for temp tags, stricter requirements for car dealers, and harsher penalties for illegal activity.' Ruiz, who sponsored the bill, stressed, 'Tougher regulations and fines are needed to weed out bad actors.' The Motor Vehicle Commission helped develop the proposal and plans its own regulatory overhaul. The New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, represented by Jim Appleton, warned the bill could 'punish or burden the legitimate players.' Similar efforts are underway in Georgia and New York City, where Council Member Oswald Feliz has introduced related bills. The measure aims to close loopholes that let drivers evade accountability, a known risk to public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seventeen council members back it. Delivery giants resist. They call it unworkable. Workers face fire risk. City Hall sides with safety. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On November 22, 2023, Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz introduced a bill in the New York City Council requiring delivery companies to provide safe, certified e-bikes and batteries to their workers. The bill, supported by 17 sponsors, aims to curb deadly fires caused by uncertified lithium-ion batteries. The matter summary states, 'Delivery companies are opposing a new bill...that would require them to provide delivery workers with safe, certified e-bikes and batteries.' Feliz, joined by advocates like Ligia Guallpa, argues that companies profit from deliveristas and must bear the cost of safety. Delivery giants Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub oppose the bill, calling it 'simply infeasible' and propose a centralized fund instead. The Adams administration, represented by Carlos Ortiz, supports the bill, insisting business apps are responsible for worker safety. The bill remains under council consideration, with the debate ongoing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law aims to protect delivery workers and consumers from battery fires. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Marjorie Velazquez back new bills requiring app-based delivery companies to provide safe e-bikes and batteries. Velazquez called the bill a 'key' step for safety. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project testified that certified batteries are too expensive and in short supply. Delivery workers, facing high costs and legal threats, often keep using unsafe batteries or turn to gas-powered mopeds. App companies resist, citing worker status and costs. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection has started enforcement, but the core danger persists: safe batteries are out of reach for many, leaving workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The main bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, creates a city-funded buy-back program for delivery workers to exchange faulty batteries and devices for safe, certified ones. The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
