First, a road rage assault. Then, an ambulance strikes him as he waits for help. The news calls it an accident. The city calls it a statistic. But the pain is real. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 117 were injured</strong> in crashes across Bronx CB27. No one was spared: children, elders, workers, the young and the old. Seventeen kids were hurt. No one calls to check if they made it home.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h2><p>Since 2022, <strong>seven people have died</strong> on these streets. Three were killed by cars or SUVs. One was a pedestrian, struck and left with nothing but a line in a database. Three others died behind the wheel or on two wheels. <strong>Three suffered serious injuries</strong>—the kind that never leave you.</p><p>The last year saw a drop in deaths, but injuries rose. <strong>Injuries jumped 27%</strong> compared to the year before. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-promises>The Leaders and Their Promises</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. They talk about Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set safer speeds. But talk is not action. The law sits on the table. The speed limit stays high. The cameras wait for reauthorization.</p><p>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has called for a 20 mph limit here. No one has demanded more cameras or safer crossings. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets where children can walk without fear.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, the toll grows. The next name could be someone you know.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The council members wrote, 'The sale and use of fraudulent paper plates has created new challenges in New York City: cars using such plates cannot be easily traced, and thereby pose a street safety threat to New Yorkers.' Feliz and his colleagues demand that only legitimate dealerships issue paper plates and that validity be capped at 30 days nationwide. They note that some states allow up to 90 days, overwhelming communities and making enforcement difficult. The council’s push follows local proposals for stiffer penalties.

MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey said, "Our hope is that we DOT stays with us and we're implementing this, hopefully, later this year."

DOT spokesperson Vin Barone described a new proposal with dedicated curbside loading and minimal traffic diversions. The city’s earlier pledge for 20 new miles of bus lanes per year has not been met.

The hearing spotlighted two bills from Council Member Oswald Feliz to raise fines for using or selling fake plates, both widely supported, including by the NYPD. The matter summary: 'NYPD claims it has stepped up its efforts to summons and arrest car drivers who cover or deface their plate, or drive with a fake temporary tag, but its own statistics show that the effort has not continued into this year.' Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable.

They warn of traffic chaos and harm to local life.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2023, Council Member Oswald Feliz (District 15) joined Bronx business and institution leaders in public opposition to a city Department of Transportation proposal for new bus lanes or a car-free busway on Fordham Road. The matter, described as a plan to 'improve bus service down busy Fordham Road,' faces fierce pushback from the Belmont and Fordham Road Business Improvement Districts, the Bronx Zoo, Fordham University, and others. Feliz, who signed a letter to Mayor Adams, said, 'DOT has completely abandoned the bus lanes on Fordham Road and that has caused the issues we’re seeing. We must ensure buses are moving and we can address that by fixing the bus lanes we have.' The letter calls for repainting bus lanes and installing fixed cameras before considering new restrictions. Opponents argue the plan would worsen traffic, hurt business, and shift congestion to side streets. The proposal remains under review, with no committee or bill number assigned.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Bronx Business Leaders and Local Institutions Want to Halt Bus Fixes on Fordham Rd,' highlights their demand for Mayor Adams to halt improvements meant for 85,000 daily bus riders. The Belmont and Fordham Business Improvement Districts, along with the Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Garden, Fordham University, Monroe College, and St. Barnabas Hospital, argue the changes would 'significantly impact crucial traffic flow' and burden side streets. State Sen. Gustavo Rivera voiced support for transit equity but awaits a traffic study. DOT claims to work with the community. Despite business concerns, advocates and city data show most shoppers use transit, walking, or biking, not cars.
