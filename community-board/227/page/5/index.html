A Mustang turned, then surged forward. Metal struck flesh. The car plowed into scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran. <strong>&ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. All six landed in the hospital. The street was left with blood and broken beams. No arrests. No answers.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h2><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 116 people were injured and one killed in 112 crashes in Bronx CB27.</strong> Children were among the hurt. Not one serious injury was recorded, but the wounds linger. Over the past three years, seven have died. Three were pedestrians. Most were hit by cars or SUVs. The numbers do not grieve. They only count.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored bills to daylight intersections and add speed humps near parks. He backed the SAFE Streets Act, calling for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. But when it came to Fordham Road, he stood with business owners and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/30/bronx-business-leaders-and-local-institutions-want-to-halt-bus-fixes-on-fordham-rd>blocked a busway</a> that would have protected 85,000 daily riders—many of them walking, many of them at risk. The city passed laws. The street waits for action.</p><h2 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h2><p>After the Mustang hit, panic spread. <strong>&ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The city moved on. The pain stayed.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings, busways, and daylighted corners. Demand that the city stop blaming the people who walk and start protecting them. <strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Members Oswald Feliz (primary), Gale A. Brewer, Erik D. Bottcher, and Robert F. Holden sponsored the measure. It would have imposed fines up to $1,000 and jail time for repeat offenders. The bill was filed at session’s end, leaving enforcement unchanged.

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the NYPD to run tow pound facilities with enough capacity to deter illegal parking and traffic violations. It also mandated annual public reports on tow pound use and enforcement, disaggregated by precinct. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department tow pound capacity.' Council Members Kamillah Hanks (primary sponsor), Oswald Feliz, Sandra Ung, Lincoln Restler, Shaun Abreu, Farah N. Louis, Mercedes Narcisse, and Amanda Farías sponsored the bill. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. No safety analyst assessed the impact for vulnerable road users.

The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The city’s crosswalks remain unchanged. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The map must show disruptions, detours, hazards, and closures in real time. The bill summary states: 'Cyclists deserve the same attention and information already given to the city's drivers and transit riders in the form of notifications, updates, and well-marked detours.' Council Member Carlina Rivera sponsored the bill and led its passage. Rivera and Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt wrote, 'Disruption of any city bikeway requires public information, working detours and operational attention—not just an unheralded shut-down.' The law aims to end the chaos and danger of sudden bike lane closures, giving half a million daily riders the information they need to stay safe and keep moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable commuters wait.</p><p class=mb3>On July 20, 2023, the MTA called on Mayor Eric Adams and the Department of Transportation (DOT) to support renewed bus lane expansion on Fordham Road. The city had canceled a planned busway after pushback from business owners and Council Member Oswald Feliz, who remains a vocal critic. MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey said, "Our hope is that we DOT stays with us and we're implementing this, hopefully, later this year." MTA CEO Janno Lieber stressed, "We can't deemphasize and under-prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx and also Upper Manhattan who are trying to get east and west across this incredibly busy corridor." DOT spokesperson Vin Barone described a new proposal with dedicated curbside loading and minimal traffic diversions. The city’s earlier pledge for 20 new miles of bus lanes per year has not been met. Eighty-five thousand daily bus riders, many vulnerable, remain at risk on slow, crowded streets. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
