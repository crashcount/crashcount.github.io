A Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then hit the riders. Both were thrown and died at the hospital, police said. <strong>Two lives, gone</strong>. “Two men on motorcycles were killed in the crash overnight,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/fatal-7-car-crash-on-bronx-river-parkway/>said NYPD</a>. A family stood outside court and asked why the driver walked. “How could they let him go?

Since 2022, <strong>the Bronx River Parkway is the top hotspot</strong> in CB27 for harm, with multiple deaths and injuries.

So is the silence between sirens.</p><h3 id=where-it-hurts>Where it hurts</h3><p>Hotspots stack up: <strong>Bronx River Parkway</strong> and <strong>Southern Boulevard</strong> lead the roll call of pain.

The ledger does not lie.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-did--and-didnt>What leaders did — and didn’t</h3><p>There is motion in Albany. <strong>State Sen. Gustavo Rivera</strong> voted yes in committee on the speed‑limiter bill <strong>S 4045</strong>, aimed at drivers who rack up violations; he also voted to extend school speed zones. <strong>Assembly Member George Alvarez</strong> missed key committee votes on school speed zones but co‑sponsored the Assembly speed‑limiter bill. <strong>Council Member Oswald Feliz</strong> backed smaller safety bills, yet opposed stronger bus fixes on Fordham Road that protect people outside cars. The MTA pleaded for urgency. “We can&rsquo;t deemphasize and under‑prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/07/20/mtas-hope-for-eric-adams-stay-with-us-on-fordham-road>said Janno Lieber’s team</a>.</p><h3 id=what-will-stop-the-bleeding>What will stop the bleeding</h3><ul><li><strong>Lower speeds</strong>: Use city authority to set a safer default and add 20 mph zones.</li><li><strong>Speed limiters for repeat offenders</strong>: Pass and enforce <strong>S 4045/A 2299</strong> to curb the worst drivers.</li><li><strong>Local fixes at hotspots</strong>: Night enforcement and lighting upgrades on the Bronx River Parkway; <strong>daylighting and LPIs</strong> on Southern Boulevard; hardened turns and tighter lanes near ramps.</li></ul><p><strong>Act now.</strong> Tell your council member, assembly member, and senator to back lower speeds and speed limiters.

The vehicle lay demolished, a brutal testament to reckless velocity.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 2007 Jeep SUV driven by an unlicensed 30-year-old woman crashed on Bronx River Parkway at 3:17 AM. The report identifies 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor. The driver was traveling northbound and lost control, resulting in a catastrophic impact that demolished the vehicle and twisted its frame beyond saving. The driver, who wore no seat belt, was ejected from the SUV and suffered fatal injuries including a shattered pelvis and severe lacerations. The police report explicitly notes the driver's unlicensed status and unsafe speed as causes of the crash. A front-seat passenger, a 34-year-old man wearing a lap belt and harness, was injured with internal complaints and shoulder-upper arm trauma but was not ejected. No victim behaviors contributed to the crash according to the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

More hours. More car-free blocks. Pedestrians and cyclists get space when crowds surge. Streets shift from traffic to people. Danger drops. The city listens to neighborhoods.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 0270-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 28, 2024, it amends city code to require the Department of Transportation to expand Open Streets hours on holidays with heavy foot traffic—Memorial Day, Juneteenth, July 4th, Labor Day, Halloween, and others. The bill reads: 'special activation of the Open Streets program on certain holidays and time periods with significant pedestrian traffic.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Brooks-Powers, Louis, Nurse, Ossé, Sanchez, Cabán, Banks, Avilés, Riley, Salaam, Hanif, Feliz, Won, Restler, and Joseph. Community groups can suggest more dates. The city must review all requests under the same standards as regular Open Streets. This bill aims to give people the street when they need it most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, introduced February 28, 2024, and discussed again on April 28, 2025, reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department tow pound capacity.'
