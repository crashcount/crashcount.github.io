A Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then hit the riders. Both were thrown and died at the hospital, police said. <strong>Two lives, gone</strong>. “Two men on motorcycles were killed in the crash overnight,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/fatal-7-car-crash-on-bronx-river-parkway/>said NYPD</a>. A family stood outside court and asked why the driver walked. “How could they let him go?

Since 2022, <strong>the Bronx River Parkway is the top hotspot</strong> in CB27 for harm, with multiple deaths and injuries.

So is the silence between sirens.</p><h3 id=where-it-hurts>Where it hurts</h3><p>Hotspots stack up: <strong>Bronx River Parkway</strong> and <strong>Southern Boulevard</strong> lead the roll call of pain.

The ledger does not lie.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-did--and-didnt>What leaders did — and didn’t</h3><p>There is motion in Albany. <strong>State Sen. Gustavo Rivera</strong> voted yes in committee on the speed‑limiter bill <strong>S 4045</strong>, aimed at drivers who rack up violations; he also voted to extend school speed zones. <strong>Assembly Member George Alvarez</strong> missed key committee votes on school speed zones but co‑sponsored the Assembly speed‑limiter bill. <strong>Council Member Oswald Feliz</strong> backed smaller safety bills, yet opposed stronger bus fixes on Fordham Road that protect people outside cars. The MTA pleaded for urgency. “We can&rsquo;t deemphasize and under‑prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/07/20/mtas-hope-for-eric-adams-stay-with-us-on-fordham-road>said Janno Lieber’s team</a>.</p><h3 id=what-will-stop-the-bleeding>What will stop the bleeding</h3><ul><li><strong>Lower speeds</strong>: Use city authority to set a safer default and add 20 mph zones.</li><li><strong>Speed limiters for repeat offenders</strong>: Pass and enforce <strong>S 4045/A 2299</strong> to curb the worst drivers.</li><li><strong>Local fixes at hotspots</strong>: Night enforcement and lighting upgrades on the Bronx River Parkway; <strong>daylighting and LPIs</strong> on Southern Boulevard; hardened turns and tighter lanes near ramps.</li></ul><p><strong>Act now.</strong> Tell your council member, assembly member, and senator to back lower speeds and speed limiters.
