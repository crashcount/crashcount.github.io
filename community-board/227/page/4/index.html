A family stood outside court and asked why the driver walked. “How could they let him go?

The ledger does not lie.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-did--and-didnt>What leaders did — and didn’t</h3><p>There is motion in Albany. <strong>State Sen. Gustavo Rivera</strong> voted yes in committee on the speed‑limiter bill <strong>S 4045</strong>, aimed at drivers who rack up violations; he also voted to extend school speed zones. <strong>Assembly Member George Alvarez</strong> missed key committee votes on school speed zones but co‑sponsored the Assembly speed‑limiter bill. <strong>Council Member Oswald Feliz</strong> backed smaller safety bills, yet opposed stronger bus fixes on Fordham Road that protect people outside cars. The MTA pleaded for urgency. “We can&rsquo;t deemphasize and under‑prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/07/20/mtas-hope-for-eric-adams-stay-with-us-on-fordham-road>said Janno Lieber’s team</a>.</p><h3 id=what-will-stop-the-bleeding>What will stop the bleeding</h3><ul><li><strong>Lower speeds</strong>: Use city authority to set a safer default and add 20 mph zones.</li><li><strong>Speed limiters for repeat offenders</strong>: Pass and enforce <strong>S 4045/A 2299</strong> to curb the worst drivers.</li><li><strong>Local fixes at hotspots</strong>: Night enforcement and lighting upgrades on the Bronx River Parkway; <strong>daylighting and LPIs</strong> on Southern Boulevard; hardened turns and tighter lanes near ramps.</li></ul><p><strong>Act now.</strong> Tell your council member, assembly member, and senator to back lower speeds and speed limiters.

Steel scraped concrete. Debris rained down. No one was hurt. The wall broke. The rules broke first.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on January 17, 2025, that a BxM1 MTA bus nearly plunged from the Henry Hudson Parkway overpass after the driver swerved to avoid an illegally double-parked car. The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.
