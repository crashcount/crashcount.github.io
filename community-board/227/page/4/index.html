First, a road rage assault. Then, an ambulance strikes him as he waits for help. The news calls it an accident. The city calls it a statistic. But the pain is real. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 117 were injured</strong> in crashes across Bronx CB27. No one was spared: children, elders, workers, the young and the old. Seventeen kids were hurt. No one calls to check if they made it home.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h2><p>Since 2022, <strong>seven people have died</strong> on these streets. Three were killed by cars or SUVs. One was a pedestrian, struck and left with nothing but a line in a database. Three others died behind the wheel or on two wheels. <strong>Three suffered serious injuries</strong>—the kind that never leave you.</p><p>The last year saw a drop in deaths, but injuries rose. <strong>Injuries jumped 27%</strong> compared to the year before. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-promises>The Leaders and Their Promises</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. They talk about Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set safer speeds. But talk is not action. The law sits on the table. The speed limit stays high. The cameras wait for reauthorization.</p><p>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has called for a 20 mph limit here. No one has demanded more cameras or safer crossings. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets where children can walk without fear.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, the toll grows.

Brokers must hold Georgia licenses and show five sales yearly. The Department of Revenue could suspend or revoke dealer access for violations.

The bill was discussed at a City Council hearing on February 1, 2024. The Adams administration, represented by DOT officials Margaret Forgione and Will Carry, voiced strong support, citing 'public safety risks posed by growing risks of uncertified e-bike batteries.' The bill aims to help delivery workers transition to legal, safe devices and address both street and fire safety. Last year, 18 people died in 268 lithium-ion battery fires. Delivery companies like Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub oppose the bill, claiming it could lead to fraud and fail to solve the battery crisis. Workers' advocates back the bill but demand protections against retaliation, noting certified batteries are expensive and scarce.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Projects were delayed or canceled. The city cited staff shortages and budget cuts. Council members condemned the failures. Vulnerable road users remain exposed. Promises faded. Danger persists.</p><p class=mb3>In 2023, Mayor Adams failed to meet the mandates of the 2019 Streets Master Plan, which required 50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of protected or enhanced bus lanes. The law, championed by then-Speaker Corey Johnson, aimed for safer, more equitable streets. Key projects, including bike lanes on McGuinness Boulevard and Ashland Place, and bus lanes on Fordham Road, were stalled or abandoned. The Department of Transportation blamed staff shortages and budget cuts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and other members voiced frustration but admitted limited power to enforce compliance. Council Member Chi Ossé was mentioned in coverage. Without mayoral commitment, the plan’s promise to protect vulnerable road users remains unfulfilled. The city’s vision for safer streets is at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article details how Council Member Oswald Feliz (District 15) joined U.S. Rep. Adriano Espaillat to oppose the Fordham Road busway, leading Mayor Adams to cancel the project. The matter title asks, 'Who is the Activist of the Year?' and highlights setbacks: 'City Hall canceled bus lanes, scaled back bike lanes and stalled open streets.' Feliz’s opposition helped powerful interests defeat the busway, leaving only more enforcement cameras. Riders Alliance, once supportive of the mayor, revoked his 'bus mayor' title, calling his administration’s transit policy 'a betrayal.' The piece underscores how advocates, not politicians, drove progress for vulnerable road users, even as official actions fell short.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates pushed back.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy campaign, highlighted in the December 27, 2023 Streetsblog NYC article, reviews the relentless push by New York City activists for safer streets. The piece, titled '2023 in Review: Who is the Activist of the Year?', details how groups like Make McGuinness Safe, Worker's Justice Project, Riders Alliance, and Astoria's r/MicromobilityNYC subredditors challenged City Hall's pro-car inertia. Despite setbacks—canceled bus lanes, watered-down bike projects—advocates secured protected bike lanes, traffic calming, and a minimum wage for delivery workers. Council members and city officials often opposed or delayed these measures, but activists, including Bronwyn Breitner and Ligia Guallpa, kept pressure on. The article underscores that every gain for vulnerable road users came from organized, persistent advocacy, not government initiative.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Oswald Feliz (primary), Gale A. Brewer, Erik D. Bottcher, and Robert F. Holden sponsored the measure. It would have imposed fines up to $1,000 and jail time for repeat offenders.

The bill, advanced by the Senate Transportation Committee, proposes 'new security features for temp tags, stricter requirements for car dealers, and harsher penalties for illegal activity.' Ruiz, who sponsored the bill, stressed, 'Tougher regulations and fines are needed to weed out bad actors.' The Motor Vehicle Commission helped develop the proposal and plans its own regulatory overhaul. The New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, represented by Jim Appleton, warned the bill could 'punish or burden the legitimate players.' Similar efforts are underway in Georgia and New York City, where Council Member Oswald Feliz has introduced related bills. The measure aims to close loopholes that let drivers evade accountability, a known risk to public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
