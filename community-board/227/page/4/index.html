A Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then hit the riders.

A family stood outside court and asked why the driver walked. “How could they let him go?

Steel scraped concrete. Debris rained down. No one was hurt. The wall broke. The rules broke first.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on January 17, 2025, that a BxM1 MTA bus nearly plunged from the Henry Hudson Parkway overpass after the driver swerved to avoid an illegally double-parked car. The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals.
