First, a road rage assault. Then, an ambulance strikes him as he waits for help. The news calls it an accident. The city calls it a statistic. But the pain is real. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 117 were injured</strong> in crashes across Bronx CB27. No one was spared: children, elders, workers, the young and the old. Seventeen kids were hurt. No one calls to check if they made it home.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h2><p>Since 2022, <strong>seven people have died</strong> on these streets. Three were killed by cars or SUVs. One was a pedestrian, struck and left with nothing but a line in a database. Three others died behind the wheel or on two wheels. <strong>Three suffered serious injuries</strong>—the kind that never leave you.</p><p>The last year saw a drop in deaths, but injuries rose. <strong>Injuries jumped 27%</strong> compared to the year before. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-promises>The Leaders and Their Promises</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. They talk about Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set safer speeds. But talk is not action. The law sits on the table. The speed limit stays high. The cameras wait for reauthorization.</p><p>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has called for a 20 mph limit here. No one has demanded more cameras or safer crossings. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets where children can walk without fear.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, the toll grows.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Oswald Feliz, lets companies comply by funding trade-in programs or subsidizing bike-share memberships. The matter summary states: 'require app-based delivery companies to provide their workers with certified e-bikes or underwrite their access.' The law covers all delivery apps and sets targets by company size. Workers cannot be deactivated for lacking compliant bikes.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1252-2025, introduced April 24, 2025, sits with the Committee on Public Safety. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department parking enforcement," demands the NYPD confirm license plates and VINs on vehicles with temporary tags or those ticketed for violations. The NYPD must also release quarterly reports on parking enforcement. Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Oswald Feliz, Lincoln Restler, Robert F. Holden, and Chris Banks sponsor the measure. On April 28, 2025, the committee laid the bill over. The bill aims to expose enforcement gaps and bring accountability, but for now, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—see no immediate relief. The system stalls. The risk remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
