First, a road rage assault. Then, an ambulance strikes him as he waits for help. The news calls it an accident. The city calls it a statistic. But the pain is real. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 117 were injured</strong> in crashes across Bronx CB27. No one was spared: children, elders, workers, the young and the old. Seventeen kids were hurt. No one calls to check if they made it home.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h2><p>Since 2022, <strong>seven people have died</strong> on these streets. Three were killed by cars or SUVs. One was a pedestrian, struck and left with nothing but a line in a database. Three others died behind the wheel or on two wheels. <strong>Three suffered serious injuries</strong>—the kind that never leave you.</p><p>The last year saw a drop in deaths, but injuries rose. <strong>Injuries jumped 27%</strong> compared to the year before. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-promises>The Leaders and Their Promises</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. They talk about Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set safer speeds. But talk is not action. The law sits on the table. The speed limit stays high. The cameras wait for reauthorization.</p><p>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has called for a 20 mph limit here. No one has demanded more cameras or safer crossings. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets where children can walk without fear.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, the toll grows. The next name could be someone you know.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

After leaving his car running outside a restaurant, a suspect jumped in and sped off. The victim clung to the door as the car accelerated. Detectives told ABC7 the suspect 'intentionally sideswiped a parked car,' knocking the man to the ground. The victim suffered head trauma and lost his left leg. The stolen Infiniti was later found abandoned, showing crash damage. The Bronx has seen a 3.6% rise in car thefts this year, even as rates fall citywide.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department parking enforcement," demands the NYPD confirm license plates and VINs on vehicles with temporary tags or those ticketed for violations. The NYPD must also release quarterly reports on parking enforcement. Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Oswald Feliz, Lincoln Restler, Robert F. Holden, and Chris Banks sponsor the measure. On April 28, 2025, the committee laid the bill over. The bill aims to expose enforcement gaps and bring accountability, but for now, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—see no immediate relief. The system stalls.
