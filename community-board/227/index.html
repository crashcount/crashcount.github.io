First, a road rage assault. Then, an ambulance strikes him as he waits for help. The news calls it an accident. The city calls it a statistic. But the pain is real. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 117 were injured</strong> in crashes across Bronx CB27. No one was spared: children, elders, workers, the young and the old. Seventeen kids were hurt. No one calls to check if they made it home.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h2><p>Since 2022, <strong>seven people have died</strong> on these streets. Three were killed by cars or SUVs. One was a pedestrian, struck and left with nothing but a line in a database. Three others died behind the wheel or on two wheels. <strong>Three suffered serious injuries</strong>—the kind that never leave you.</p><p>The last year saw a drop in deaths, but injuries rose. <strong>Injuries jumped 27%</strong> compared to the year before. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-promises>The Leaders and Their Promises</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. They talk about Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set safer speeds. But talk is not action. The law sits on the table. The speed limit stays high. The cameras wait for reauthorization.</p><p>No local leader has stood in the street and said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; No one has called for a 20 mph limit here. No one has demanded more cameras or safer crossings. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets where children can walk without fear.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, the toll grows. The next name could be someone you know.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
