It arrives every week, every day, in the slow grind of wheels on asphalt and bodies broken in the crosswalk. <strong>In the last twelve months, three people died and 397 were injured in 859 crashes.</strong> Ten were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just last spring, a cyclist was killed at Centre and Broome. In October, a woman crossing with the signal at Crosby and Spring was struck and killed by a turning SUV. A man was crushed by a backing garbage truck on Cornelia Street. These are not rare events. They are the city’s heartbeat now.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A crash is not an accident. It is a system working as designed. <strong>Most victims are walkers and cyclists.</strong> The numbers are cold: cars and SUVs caused the most harm, with 4 deaths and 235 injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, injured 23. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens more hurt. The cost is measured in lives cut short, families left waiting for someone who will not come home.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;It felt like he was scratching like big noise and I was honking like stop and he kept doing it,&rdquo;</strong> said Martina Minor after a Midtown chase ended in wreckage and fear (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-chase-midtown-manhattan-results-multiple-smashed-cars-drivers-arrest/17241821/>ABC7</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but slowly. Assembly Member <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8787&amp;term=2025">Deborah Glick</a> and State Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Brian Kavanagh</a> both voted to renew and expand speed camera enforcement near schools. Glick also sponsored bills to crack down on drivers who hide their plates and to extend camera enforcement. But the citywide 20 mph limit allowed by Sammy’s Law remains unused. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand cameras that work, and laws that stop repeat offenders. <strong>The dead cannot speak. You can.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fuselage, rotor, and tail tore loose. Loud bangs echoed. The craft plunged. No black box. No warning. Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
