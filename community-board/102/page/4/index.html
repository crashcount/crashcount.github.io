Two people on bikes. Three vehicle occupants. Pedestrians were hurt 324 times; cyclists 348.

A 54‑year‑old woman, crossing with the signal at Spring and Crosby, was struck and killed by a left‑turning Jeep. Cops marked failure to yield. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>May 16, 2024. Cornelia Street.

The Bowery at East 4th.

The harm is not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>SUVs and sedans lead the toll on people walking: 175 pedestrian injuries and four deaths from cars and SUVs; taxis add another death and 35 more injuries; trucks take one more life. Bikes injure too, often at crowded crossings.

Narrow lanes and raise crossings on Broome. Rein in truck backing on Cornelia with off‑hour loading and strict backing plans.</p><p>Citywide, the tools are on the table. Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> Council and state leaders have also pushed bills to stop plate‑covering and expand automated enforcement. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">Open States A 7997</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8787&amp;term=2025">Open States A 8787</a></p><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city now has the power to act on speeds and to curb repeat speeders with limiters if Albany finishes the job. The Senate has moved on a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with repeated violations; Senator Brian Kavanagh voted yes in committee. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a></p><p>Families keep paying at the crosswalk.

In February 2024, journalist Fazil Khan died in a Harlem apartment fire started by a charging battery; 22 others were injured. The article notes, 'Fires from unregulated e-bike batteries have already caused too much harm, including tragic loss of life.' The city’s $2 million pilot lets delivery workers exchange uncertified e-bikes and batteries for certified, UL-standard models. The program also requires a safety course. While battery-related fires rose slightly from 268 in 2023 to 277 in 2024, fatalities fell from 18 to 6. The article highlights ongoing risks from uncertified batteries and the city’s push for safer equipment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

If owners ignore DOT repair orders or leave dangerous cracks, they face $250 fines. The bill aims to force action before someone gets hurt.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."
