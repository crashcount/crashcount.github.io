Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> In three years, the streets of Manhattan CB2—Soho, Greenwich Village, West Village—have not let up. Cyclists, pedestrians, elders, children. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on Broome Street, sirens on Cornelia, a life ended at Bleecker and Sixth.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months alone:</strong> 2 killed, 10 seriously injured, 334 hurt. The dead include a 44-year-old cyclist thrown under a truck after a van door swung open on Broome Street. The driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>admitted, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo;</a> The man on the bike was Georgios Smaragdis. He never made it home.</p><p>A few days later, a cyclist was crushed in a hit-and-run at 5th Avenue and 13th. Myung Jin Chung woke up in an ambulance. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/52-year-old-cyclist-injured-traumatic-hit-run-west-village-speaks/16395629/>&ldquo;All my body was blood and the sweater,&rdquo; Chung said.</a> He needed sixteen hours of surgery. The driver ran two red lights and vanished.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h2><p><strong>City Hall talks of Vision Zero.</strong> Lower speed limits. More cameras. Safer intersections. But in CB2, the carnage continues. The city has the power to set a 20 mph speed limit. It has not used it. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word on renewal.</p><p>No press conferences on Broome Street. No new protected lanes. No public reckoning for the dead. The drivers who stayed at the scene walk free. The ones who fled are still gone.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not silent.</strong> Residents and advocates have pushed for change. Some leaders listen. Most wait. The city can act now—lower the speed limit, harden the lanes, keep the cameras running. But every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is a choice. Until leaders act, the disaster will grind on.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers. Assembly Member Grace Lee said, 'They should be exempt from tolls under the congestion pricing plan.' The MTA has not taken a position on the exemption.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He calls for federal funds to turn the highway into a bike and pedestrian haven. The plan faces legal and political hurdles but aims to reclaim space for people.</p><p class=mb3>On September 20, 2023, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine revived a proposal to remove the FDR Drive viaduct south of the Brooklyn Bridge. The plan, not yet in committee or assigned a bill number, seeks federal support through the Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods grant. Levine urges Mayor Adams to apply for funding, stating, 'We’re a perfect candidate for Reconnecting Communities.' State Senator Brian Kavanagh voiced support, saying, 'We will work with the borough president.' The proposal would transform the underused highway into a waterfront space for cyclists and pedestrians, echoing successful removals in cities like Seattle and Seoul. The project faces major legal, environmental, and jurisdictional obstacles, as the FDR is state-owned and exempt from congestion pricing. The city previously considered this removal for coastal resiliency, but dropped it from the final plan. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the plan centers vulnerable road users by reclaiming space from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
