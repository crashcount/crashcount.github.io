The matter, described as 'NYC Council oversight and advocacy regarding cruise ship shore power requirements and port emissions policy,' highlights the slow pace of retrofitting ships for shore power. Avilés declared, 'We want a more aggressive timeframe,' and criticized the 2028 and 2035 deadlines. Residents and advocates blasted the EDC for broken promises and ongoing pollution, noting that California ports required shore power years ago. The Red Hook terminal has shore power since 2016, but many ships ignore it. Manhattan’s terminal still lacks the needed infrastructure. The council’s push aims to end years of toxic emissions that harm waterfront communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the pedestrian suffered a head injury with severe bleeding but remained conscious and upright after the impact. The narrative describes the car’s rear end bearing the mark of the collision, with blood pooling on the crosswalk. The police report explicitly lists 'Backing Unsafely' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The pedestrian was located at the intersection and was crossing with the signal, as documented in the report. The focus remains on the driver’s unsafe backing and inattention, which led to the pedestrian’s injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The official title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to notice requirements for certain transportation projects and the repeal of section 19-187 in relation thereto.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of colleagues. The law repeals the old, separate bike lane notice process and folds it into the broader project notice rules. Now, after a set notice period and community feedback, the Department of Transportation can move ahead without delay.
