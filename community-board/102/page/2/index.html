Two people on bikes. Three vehicle occupants. Pedestrians were hurt 324 times; cyclists 348.

A 54‑year‑old woman, crossing with the signal at Spring and Crosby, was struck and killed by a left‑turning Jeep. Cops marked failure to yield. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>May 16, 2024. Cornelia Street.

The Bowery at East 4th.

The harm is not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>SUVs and sedans lead the toll on people walking: 175 pedestrian injuries and four deaths from cars and SUVs; taxis add another death and 35 more injuries; trucks take one more life. Bikes injure too, often at crowded crossings.

Clear the corners. Slow the cars.</h3><p>The crash map points to the same moves: daylight the corners at Lafayette, Seventh, and Broome; add hardened left turns where drivers keep cutting across walkers; add leading pedestrian intervals and no‑turn‑on‑red at the repeat sites. Narrow lanes and raise crossings on Broome. Rein in truck backing on Cornelia with off‑hour loading and strict backing plans.</p><p>Citywide, the tools are on the table. Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> Council and state leaders have also pushed bills to stop plate‑covering and expand automated enforcement. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">Open States A 7997</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8787&amp;term=2025">Open States A 8787</a></p><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city now has the power to act on speeds and to curb repeat speeders with limiters if Albany finishes the job. The Senate has moved on a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with repeated violations; Senator Brian Kavanagh voted yes in committee. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a></p><p>Families keep paying at the crosswalk.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...exempting ambulettes from certain bus lane restrictions and allowing them to double park to assist passengers,' would let ambulettes drive, stop, and double-park in bus lanes to help passengers. Council Member Julie Menin sponsors, joined by Linda Lee, Frank Morano, Eric Dinowitz, Lynn C. Schulman, Kamillah Hanks, Carlina Rivera, and Chris Banks. Allowing more vehicles to double-park and block bus lanes increases risk for pedestrians and cyclists at the curb. The city’s most vulnerable will face more conflict and less safe space.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, described as 'an extra boost' for automated enforcement, updates home-rule provisions first enacted in 2013. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick sponsored the measure. Both praised the program’s record in cutting speeds and saving lives. Council member Barbara Russo-Lennon supported the renewal. A safety analyst notes the extension is likely to reduce speeds and crashes, improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists, especially children, without burdening vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
