Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> In three years, the streets of Manhattan CB2—Soho, Greenwich Village, West Village—have not let up. Cyclists, pedestrians, elders, children. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on Broome Street, sirens on Cornelia, a life ended at Bleecker and Sixth.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months alone:</strong> 2 killed, 10 seriously injured, 334 hurt. The dead include a 44-year-old cyclist thrown under a truck after a van door swung open on Broome Street. The driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>admitted, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo;</a> The man on the bike was Georgios Smaragdis. He never made it home.</p><p>A few days later, a cyclist was crushed in a hit-and-run at 5th Avenue and 13th. Myung Jin Chung woke up in an ambulance. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/52-year-old-cyclist-injured-traumatic-hit-run-west-village-speaks/16395629/>&ldquo;All my body was blood and the sweater,&rdquo; Chung said.</a> He needed sixteen hours of surgery. The driver ran two red lights and vanished.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h2><p><strong>City Hall talks of Vision Zero.</strong> Lower speed limits. More cameras. Safer intersections. But in CB2, the carnage continues. The city has the power to set a 20 mph speed limit. It has not used it. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word on renewal.</p><p>No press conferences on Broome Street. No new protected lanes. No public reckoning for the dead. The drivers who stayed at the scene walk free. The ones who fled are still gone.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not silent.</strong> Residents and advocates have pushed for change. Some leaders listen. Most wait. The city can act now—lower the speed limit, harden the lanes, keep the cameras running. But every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is a choice. Until leaders act, the disaster will grind on.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, discussed in committee, would cap siren volume at 90 decibels and encourage use of vibrating, low-frequency siren technology. The matter title calls for 'mandating the use of hi-lo, "two-tone" sirens by emergency response vehicles.' Brewer wrote, 'the city should mandate that emergency responders use hi-lo as their default siren and cap sirens at 90 decibels—as required by the proposed legislation—and scale up their use of vibrating siren technology.' The bill seeks to cut the health harms of constant siren noise, which studies link to hypertension and heart disease.

No mention of direct safety gains.</p><p class=mb3>On August 11, 2022, candidates for New York’s 10th Congressional District, including Councilwoman Carlina Rivera (District 2), debated key issues. The event, covered by nydailynews.com, focused on transit, congestion pricing, and infrastructure. The debate summary reads: “Transit issues like congestion pricing dominated part of the debate, with the candidates voicing broad support for Albany’s policy of charging drivers who enter Manhattan below 60th St.” Rivera supported congestion pricing but suggested possible incentives for electric vehicles. Other candidates called for exemptions and community input on infrastructure projects like the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. No formal safety analysis was provided. The debate highlighted broad support for policies that could shape city streets, but left the direct impact on vulnerable road users unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Action starts now.</p><p class=mb3>On August 11, 2022, the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded New York City $7.25 million for greenway network planning. The grant, part of the federal RAISE program, aims to fix the city’s fragmented, poorly maintained greenways. Senator Chuck Schumer championed the funding, saying, 'We secured $7.25 million in funding from @USDOT to expand New York City's majestic greenway system!' Council Member Carlina Rivera stressed, 'New York City’s greenway system is currently a collection of fragments. We want to change that.' The City Council is considering a 'greenways master plan' bill to mandate completion and upkeep of the network. Jon Orcutt, Bike New York, called the grant 'foundational.' The money will not build paths yet, but it forces the city to plan for a safer, connected future for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2022, Council Member Erik Bottcher, Rep. Jerry Nadler, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, State Sen. Brad Hoylman, and Assembly Members Dick Gottfried and Linda Rosenthal rallied for the 7 train station at 41st Street and 10th Avenue. The station, once promised as part of the Hudson Yards rezoning, was cut to save money. Bottcher called the cut a 'huge mistake.' Hoylman said it was a 'bait and switch.' Nadler pledged to fight for federal funding. The MTA said it would study the project. The matter: 'Pols and advocates are calling on the MTA to finally build the promised 7 train station at 41st Street and 10th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen.' No formal bill number or committee was cited. The lack of a station keeps riders on foot longer, exposing them to traffic and danger. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
