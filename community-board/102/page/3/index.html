Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> In three years, the streets of Manhattan CB2—Soho, Greenwich Village, West Village—have not let up. Cyclists, pedestrians, elders, children. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on Broome Street, sirens on Cornelia, a life ended at Bleecker and Sixth.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months alone:</strong> 2 killed, 10 seriously injured, 334 hurt. The dead include a 44-year-old cyclist thrown under a truck after a van door swung open on Broome Street. The driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>admitted, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo;</a> The man on the bike was Georgios Smaragdis. He never made it home.</p><p>A few days later, a cyclist was crushed in a hit-and-run at 5th Avenue and 13th. Myung Jin Chung woke up in an ambulance. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/52-year-old-cyclist-injured-traumatic-hit-run-west-village-speaks/16395629/>&ldquo;All my body was blood and the sweater,&rdquo; Chung said.</a> He needed sixteen hours of surgery. The driver ran two red lights and vanished.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h2><p><strong>City Hall talks of Vision Zero.</strong> Lower speed limits. More cameras. Safer intersections. But in CB2, the carnage continues. The city has the power to set a 20 mph speed limit. It has not used it. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word on renewal.</p><p>No press conferences on Broome Street. No new protected lanes. No public reckoning for the dead. The drivers who stayed at the scene walk free. The ones who fled are still gone.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not silent.</strong> Residents and advocates have pushed for change. Some leaders listen. Most wait. The city can act now—lower the speed limit, harden the lanes, keep the cameras running. But every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is a choice. Until leaders act, the disaster will grind on.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The coalition pushes for the SAFE Streets Package, including speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders and the 'Idaho stop' for cyclists. The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.' The piece highlights the urgent need for policy change to address reckless driving and systemic danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Starting May 18, the north outer roadway becomes bike-only, while the south outer roadway, once for vehicles, opens to pedestrians. The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays. The change doubles space for non-drivers and removes a vehicle lane, addressing years of systemic risk from forced mixing of vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.

Charles Komanoff, a noted analyst, criticized NYLCV’s endorsement, arguing, 'Both City of Yes and congestion pricing will generate huge environmental dividends.' Komanoff said NYLCV’s scorecard ignored Marte’s record on housing and transportation, which should have disqualified him. NYLCV President Julie Tighe admitted to a slight incumbent bias and highlighted Marte’s park work, but could not confirm if congestion pricing was discussed.

The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, the City Council debated a new bill to bring back year-round roadway dining. The measure, still in committee, follows the 2023 law that limited outdoor dining to April through November. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) leads the charge, calling the current law a 'failure' that 'prioritized parking spots over vibrant streets.' Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Lawmakers and advocates agree: high costs, bureaucracy, and seasonality block participation and hurt street life. The bill's fate remains undecided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
