A cyclist was killed in a crash involving an SUV and a box truck. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>June 23, 2024. The Bowery at East 4th. An elderly woman was struck and killed by a taxi traveling straight; the record cites traffic control disregarded. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-patterns-we-keep-ignoring>The patterns we keep ignoring</h3><p>Contributing factors keep circling back: disregarded signals, inattention, unsafe speed, failures to yield, and unsafe backing. “Other” dominates too often. It adds up to six deaths and 522 injuries by that label alone. The box on the form may be vague. The harm is not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>SUVs and sedans lead the toll on people walking: 175 pedestrian injuries and four deaths from cars and SUVs; taxis add another death and 35 more injuries; trucks take one more life. Bikes injure too, often at crowded crossings. This is a crowded grid built for legs, not speed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><h3 id=fix-the-turns-clear-the-corners-slow-the-cars>Fix the turns. Clear the corners. Slow the cars.</h3><p>The crash map points to the same moves: daylight the corners at Lafayette, Seventh, and Broome; add hardened left turns where drivers keep cutting across walkers; add leading pedestrian intervals and no‑turn‑on‑red at the repeat sites. Narrow lanes and raise crossings on Broome. Rein in truck backing on Cornelia with off‑hour loading and strict backing plans.</p><p>Citywide, the tools are on the table. Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> Council and state leaders have also pushed bills to stop plate‑covering and expand automated enforcement. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">Open States A 7997</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8787&amp;term=2025">Open States A 8787</a></p><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city now has the power to act on speeds and to curb repeat speeders with limiters if Albany finishes the job. The Senate has moved on a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with repeated violations; Senator Brian Kavanagh voted yes in committee. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a></p><p>Families keep paying at the crosswalk. Officials speak of plans and pilots. The numbers on these blocks do not wait.</p><p>For next steps and contacts, see our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A taxi, driven by a licensed male driver, was going straight ahead westbound when it struck an e-scooter traveling northbound. The point of impact was the center front end of both vehicles. The e-scooter driver, a 34-year-old female, was injured with contusions and bruises to her hip and upper leg but was conscious and not ejected. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for the e-scooter driver and also notes driver inattention for the taxi driver. No other contributing factors or victim behaviors were cited. Vehicle damage was noted as 'Other' for the e-scooter and no damage for the taxi.
