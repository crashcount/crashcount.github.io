Two people on bikes. Three vehicle occupants. Pedestrians were hurt 324 times; cyclists 348.

A 54‑year‑old woman, crossing with the signal at Spring and Crosby, was struck and killed by a left‑turning Jeep. Cops marked failure to yield. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>May 16, 2024. Cornelia Street.

The Bowery at East 4th.

The harm is not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>SUVs and sedans lead the toll on people walking: 175 pedestrian injuries and four deaths from cars and SUVs; taxis add another death and 35 more injuries; trucks take one more life. Bikes injure too, often at crowded crossings. This is a crowded grid built for legs, not speed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><h3 id=fix-the-turns-clear-the-corners-slow-the-cars>Fix the turns.

Slow the cars.</h3><p>The crash map points to the same moves: daylight the corners at Lafayette, Seventh, and Broome; add hardened left turns where drivers keep cutting across walkers; add leading pedestrian intervals and no‑turn‑on‑red at the repeat sites. Narrow lanes and raise crossings on Broome. Rein in truck backing on Cornelia with off‑hour loading and strict backing plans.</p><p>Citywide, the tools are on the table. Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> Council and state leaders have also pushed bills to stop plate‑covering and expand automated enforcement. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">Open States A 7997</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8787&amp;term=2025">Open States A 8787</a></p><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city now has the power to act on speeds and to curb repeat speeders with limiters if Albany finishes the job. The Senate has moved on a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with repeated violations; Senator Brian Kavanagh voted yes in committee. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a></p><p>Families keep paying at the crosswalk.

The contributing factor cited was driver inattention or distraction on the part of the sedan driver. The sedan's front center end impacted the bus's left rear bumper. The sedan carried two occupants; one passenger, a 40-year-old male, sustained a head injury described as a contusion or bruise and was conscious at the scene. The passenger was not ejected and was not using any safety equipment. The bus had one occupant, the driver, who was licensed and operating the vehicle properly. No other contributing factors or victim behaviors were reported.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
