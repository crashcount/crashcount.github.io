More cameras. Safer intersections. But in CB2, the carnage continues. The city has the power to set a 20 mph speed limit. It has not used it. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word on renewal.</p><p>No press conferences on Broome Street. No new protected lanes. No public reckoning for the dead. The drivers who stayed at the scene walk free. The ones who fled are still gone.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not silent.</strong> Residents and advocates have pushed for change. Some leaders listen. Most wait. The city can act now—lower the speed limit, harden the lanes, keep the cameras running. But every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is a choice. Until leaders act, the disaster will grind on.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure sits in committee.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0224-2024, now laid over in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, urges Albany to pass S.7587/A.7833—the 'Commercial E-Bike Licensing Act.' The resolution, introduced March 7, 2024, calls for 'the registration of bicycles with electric assist used for commercial purposes and creates liability for employers for certain violations.' Council Member James F. Gennaro leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gale A. Brewer, Christopher Marte, Alexa Avilés, Farah N. Louis, and Justin L. Brannan. The bill would require commercial e-bikes to be registered and display visible license information. Employers, not delivery workers, would be fined for violations like sidewalk riding. The council frames this as a way to identify dangerous vehicles and hold companies accountable, aiming to reduce injuries and deaths among pedestrians and cyclists. The measure remains under committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bicyclist, a 24-year-old woman, was injured with abrasions and remained conscious. The point of impact was the taxi’s right side doors striking the bike’s left front bumper. The report cites driver errors including passenger distraction and passing too closely as contributing factors. The bicyclist was not wearing safety equipment, but the report does not list this as a contributing factor. The taxi driver was licensed and operating a 2015 Chevrolet vehicle. The crash highlights the dangers posed by distracted drivers and insufficient clearance when passing vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Riders face dead batteries, empty docks, and mounting frustration. The city promised a pilot last year. Still, the streets wait. The delay leaves e-bike users stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On February 29, 2024, Council Member Erik Bottcher called out the Department of Transportation and Con Edison for failing to deliver electrified Citi Bike docks in his Manhattan district. The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bills, now before committee, aim to expand bike parking and storage in city parks and buildings. The matter summary states: 'A package of bills before the City Council would create more bike parking and storage in local parks and city-owned buildings to protect against theft.' Marte, the sponsor, said, 'The city is transforming to be a more bike-friendly place, but to increase that safety, to increase that accessibility, we need to make sure that we have bike storage that people can feel confident of where they're gonna leave their bikes.' Emily Jacobi of Transportation Alternatives backed the bills, noting, 'These bills will expand bike parking and bike accessibility across New York City.' The bills target the gap between car and bike parking, aiming to give cyclists safer, more reliable options.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
