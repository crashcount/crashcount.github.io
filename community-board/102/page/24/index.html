Two people on bikes. Three vehicle occupants. Pedestrians were hurt 324 times; cyclists 348. Heavy vehicles play a part: trucks and buses account for 26 pedestrian injuries and one death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>Corners repeat. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Lafayette Street</a> racks up injuries and serious injuries.

A 54‑year‑old woman, crossing with the signal at Spring and Crosby, was struck and killed by a left‑turning Jeep. Cops marked failure to yield. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>May 16, 2024. Cornelia Street. A garbage truck backing killed a 35‑year‑old man on foot.

A cyclist was killed in a crash involving an SUV and a box truck. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>June 23, 2024. The Bowery at East 4th.

It adds up to six deaths and 522 injuries by that label alone. The box on the form may be vague. The harm is not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>SUVs and sedans lead the toll on people walking: 175 pedestrian injuries and four deaths from cars and SUVs; taxis add another death and 35 more injuries; trucks take one more life. Bikes injure too, often at crowded crossings. This is a crowded grid built for legs, not speed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><h3 id=fix-the-turns-clear-the-corners-slow-the-cars>Fix the turns. Clear the corners. Slow the cars.</h3><p>The crash map points to the same moves: daylight the corners at Lafayette, Seventh, and Broome; add hardened left turns where drivers keep cutting across walkers; add leading pedestrian intervals and no‑turn‑on‑red at the repeat sites. Narrow lanes and raise crossings on Broome. Rein in truck backing on Cornelia with off‑hour loading and strict backing plans.</p><p>Citywide, the tools are on the table. Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> Council and state leaders have also pushed bills to stop plate‑covering and expand automated enforcement. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">Open States A 7997</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8787&amp;term=2025">Open States A 8787</a></p><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city now has the power to act on speeds and to curb repeat speeders with limiters if Albany finishes the job. The Senate has moved on a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with repeated violations; Senator Brian Kavanagh voted yes in committee. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a></p><p>Families keep paying at the crosswalk.

They argue the vans are vital for Asian communities. Without exemption, fares rise. Commutes get harder. The MTA has not taken a side.</p><p class=mb3>On September 24, 2023, Council Member Christopher Marte joined eight other elected officials in urging the MTA to exempt dollar vans from the upcoming congestion pricing plan. The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers. Assembly Member Grace Lee said, 'They should be exempt from tolls under the congestion pricing plan.' The MTA has not taken a position on the exemption.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He calls for federal funds to turn the highway into a bike and pedestrian haven. The plan faces legal and political hurdles but aims to reclaim space for people.</p><p class=mb3>On September 20, 2023, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine revived a proposal to remove the FDR Drive viaduct south of the Brooklyn Bridge. The plan, not yet in committee or assigned a bill number, seeks federal support through the Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods grant. Levine urges Mayor Adams to apply for funding, stating, 'We’re a perfect candidate for Reconnecting Communities.' State Senator Brian Kavanagh voiced support, saying, 'We will work with the borough president.' The proposal would transform the underused highway into a waterfront space for cyclists and pedestrians, echoing successful removals in cities like Seattle and Seoul. The project faces major legal, environmental, and jurisdictional obstacles, as the FDR is state-owned and exempt from congestion pricing. The city previously considered this removal for coastal resiliency, but dropped it from the final plan. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the plan centers vulnerable road users by reclaiming space from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
