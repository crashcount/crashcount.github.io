Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> In three years, the streets of Manhattan CB2—Soho, Greenwich Village, West Village—have not let up. Cyclists, pedestrians, elders, children. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on Broome Street, sirens on Cornelia, a life ended at Bleecker and Sixth.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months alone:</strong> 2 killed, 10 seriously injured, 334 hurt. The dead include a 44-year-old cyclist thrown under a truck after a van door swung open on Broome Street. The driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>admitted, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo;</a> The man on the bike was Georgios Smaragdis. He never made it home.</p><p>A few days later, a cyclist was crushed in a hit-and-run at 5th Avenue and 13th. Myung Jin Chung woke up in an ambulance. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/52-year-old-cyclist-injured-traumatic-hit-run-west-village-speaks/16395629/>&ldquo;All my body was blood and the sweater,&rdquo; Chung said.</a> He needed sixteen hours of surgery. The driver ran two red lights and vanished.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h2><p><strong>City Hall talks of Vision Zero.</strong> Lower speed limits. More cameras. Safer intersections. But in CB2, the carnage continues. The city has the power to set a 20 mph speed limit. It has not used it. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No word on renewal.</p><p>No press conferences on Broome Street. No new protected lanes. No public reckoning for the dead. The drivers who stayed at the scene walk free. The ones who fled are still gone.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not silent.</strong> Residents and advocates have pushed for change. Some leaders listen. Most wait. The city can act now—lower the speed limit, harden the lanes, keep the cameras running. But every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is a choice. Until leaders act, the disaster will grind on.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
