Two people on bikes. Three vehicle occupants. Pedestrians were hurt 324 times; cyclists 348. Heavy vehicles play a part: trucks and buses account for 26 pedestrian injuries and one death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>Corners repeat. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Lafayette Street</a> racks up injuries and serious injuries.

A 54‑year‑old woman, crossing with the signal at Spring and Crosby, was struck and killed by a left‑turning Jeep. Cops marked failure to yield. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>May 16, 2024. Cornelia Street. A garbage truck backing killed a 35‑year‑old man on foot.

A cyclist was killed in a crash involving an SUV and a box truck. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>June 23, 2024. The Bowery at East 4th.

It adds up to six deaths and 522 injuries by that label alone. The box on the form may be vague. The harm is not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><p>SUVs and sedans lead the toll on people walking: 175 pedestrian injuries and four deaths from cars and SUVs; taxis add another death and 35 more injuries; trucks take one more life. Bikes injure too, often at crowded crossings. This is a crowded grid built for legs, not speed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><h3 id=fix-the-turns-clear-the-corners-slow-the-cars>Fix the turns. Clear the corners. Slow the cars.</h3><p>The crash map points to the same moves: daylight the corners at Lafayette, Seventh, and Broome; add hardened left turns where drivers keep cutting across walkers; add leading pedestrian intervals and no‑turn‑on‑red at the repeat sites. Narrow lanes and raise crossings on Broome. Rein in truck backing on Cornelia with off‑hour loading and strict backing plans.</p><p>Citywide, the tools are on the table. Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> Council and state leaders have also pushed bills to stop plate‑covering and expand automated enforcement. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">Open States A 7997</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8787&amp;term=2025">Open States A 8787</a></p><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city now has the power to act on speeds and to curb repeat speeders with limiters if Albany finishes the job. The Senate has moved on a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with repeated violations; Senator Brian Kavanagh voted yes in committee. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States S 4045</a></p><p>Families keep paying at the crosswalk.

The article states, "NYPD sources said the two officers in pursuit returned to their stationhouse without reporting the crash." The FDNY later found Guzman Parra dead in the burning car. Patrick Hendry of the Police Benevolent Association claimed officers "lost sight of the car and did not know it crashed," but the family's attorney, Jeremy Feigenbaum, said their investigation "has not corroborated the officers' claim." The officers remain on leave as both the NYPD and the New York attorney general's office investigate. The case raises questions about police pursuit protocols and reporting failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It 'permits the use of photo speed violation monitoring systems in New York City for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction, concealment, and/or distortion; extends provisions permitting the use of speed cameras in certain school zones.' By targeting plate obstruction, the bill seeks to stop drivers from dodging speed camera enforcement, a move that could help protect pedestrians and cyclists from repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
