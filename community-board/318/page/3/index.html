The crash was marked speed‑related; five vehicles were involved, including an unlicensed Mercedes SUV driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>18 people killed</strong> on Brooklyn Community Board 18 streets since 2022. Another <strong>4,421 people were injured</strong> in that span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

The victim was in a marked crosswalk when hit (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Jan 31, 2024, an SUV going straight hit and killed a 68‑year‑old at E 105 Street and Glenwood Road (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=flatlands-and-utica-keep-hurting-people>Flatlands and Utica keep hurting people</h3><p>Flatlands Avenue has seen at least two deaths and 193 injuries since 2022. Utica Avenue has logged a death and more than a hundred injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Avenue J and Avenue K also rack up high injury counts. These are the places where bodies hit asphalt again and again.</p><p>Named failures appear in the record. “Failure to yield,” “disregarded traffic control,” and “inattention/distraction” run through the case files here, alongside speed in specific crashes like the Jan 27, 2024 boy’s death (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – Crashes</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-does-not-break>The pattern does not break</h3><p>In the last 12 months alone, CB18 logged 2,006 crashes, <strong>6 deaths</strong>, and 1,589 injuries.

Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city planned to move cyclists next to car traffic, but the court granted an emergency restraining order after advocates appealed. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the lane a 'critical safety project.' City Hall insists the reconfiguration is legal and claims the appeal delays 'easing the safety concerns plaguing Williamsburg parents.' The protected lane, installed in October 2024, separates cyclists from moving vehicles.
