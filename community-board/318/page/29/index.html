In Brooklyn CB18, drivers maim and kill, and the street keeps moving.</p><h3 id=seaview-and-rockaway-a-man-down-in-the-crosswalk>Seaview and Rockaway: a man down in the crosswalk</h3><p>A 66-year-old man was struck and killed at Seaview Avenue and Rockaway Parkway. The SUV kept straight. The death was recorded at 7:25 p.m. The city log lists the pedestrian “crossing against signal.” The only fact that matters is he is dead. The driver is not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC’s crash file</a> shows the SUV’s left front hit (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4768224</a>).</p><h3 id=avenue-l-and-east-88th-failure-to-yield-a-life-erased>Avenue L and East 88th: failure to yield, a life erased</h3><p>On Avenue L at E 88th Street, early evening, a driver making a left turn hit a person in the crosswalk and killed her. The record says “failure to yield.” The victim was a pedestrian at the intersection. Time: 6:46 p.m. Date: January 10, 2025. The city file carries one sharp line: “Apparent Death.” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4785035</a>).</p><h3 id=flatbush-at-hendrickson-night-strike>Flatbush at Hendrickson: night strike</h3><p>Flatbush Avenue. Hendrickson Place. 3:46 a.m. A 60-year-old pedestrian died. The SUV was going straight. Another New Yorker, gone in the dark.

A sedan at unsafe speed. Fire. The 57-year-old driver died with the belt on. The car was “demolished.” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4776867</a>).</p><p>Memorial Day weekend at Flatbush and Avenue U. A 30-year-old motorcyclist, “unsafe speed,” collided with a 2014 fire apparatus. He was ejected. He died.

Pedestrians suffer 612 reported injuries; cyclists, 177. The heaviest hours stack up when families are out: deaths peak at <strong>6 p.m., 7 p.m., 9–11 p.m.</strong> The 6 p.m. hour shows four deaths, the 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. hours add more. Injury counts swell after school and into the night. These are the clock’s hard edges, not opinions. <a href=#>District stats</a> are drawn from the same city feed used above.</p><p>On corridors, the names repeat: <strong>Flatlands Avenue</strong> (2 deaths, 193 injuries), <strong>Utica Avenue</strong> (1 death, 114 injuries), <strong>Avenue L</strong> (1 death, 101 injuries). These are not abstractions. These are blocks.

In the district rollup, speed and other driver actions lumped as “other” coincide with the most deaths and the widest harm. “Failure to yield” shows in the Avenue L killing. “Disregarded traffic control” appears in another fatal. The city’s own breakdown lists pedestrians as the largest share of deaths. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The small-geo analysis</a> gives the counts.</p><h3 id=what-the-clock-demands-now>What the clock demands now</h3><ul><li>Fix the corners that maim: daylight the crosswalks at Flatlands, Utica, and Avenue L; add hardened lefts and leading pedestrian intervals at Seaview and Rockaway; close passing lanes at Kings Highway. These are standard tools the city deploys where people die.</li><li>Target the late hours. The curve from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. carries the highest death load. Put enforcement and calming where the bodies fall.</li><li>Protect walkers first. Pedestrians take most of the deaths here. Treat their space as the priority, not the leftover.</li></ul><h3 id=the-law-can-slow-the-blood>The law can slow the blood</h3><p>Albany passed power to drop speeds citywide. The city can set <strong>20 mph</strong> on local streets. Slower streets spare lives. Our own site explains how to press the officials who hold the pen. See our guide to act now: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>At the state level, senators voted in committee for a bill to force speed limiters on repeat violators. One line says why: “Relates to requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits.” <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file S 4045</a>. Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee on June 11–12, 2025, and Senator Roxanne Persaud did too, according to the bill record.
