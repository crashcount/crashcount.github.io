A man, sixty-six, was killed at Rockaway Parkway and Seaview. A motorcyclist, thirty, collided with a fire truck on Flatbush Avenue and never got up again. In the last twelve months, five people died on the streets of Brooklyn CB18. Fourteen more were seriously injured. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. In three years, cars and SUVs killed eleven. Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes and mopeds, none. The streets are not forgiving. The old, the young, the ones just crossing—none are spared.</p><h3 id=the-sound-of-sirens-the-silence-of-leadership>The Sound of Sirens, the Silence of Leadership</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The numbers keep coming. In the past year, there were 1,577 crashes in this district alone. 1,245 people hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are names, faces, empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><p>After a chase ended with a Jeep on the L train tracks, a witness <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/driver-fleeing-cops-brooklyn-subway-station/>described the chaos</a>: &ldquo;Next thing I know, he was into the fence. Absolutely crazy.&rdquo; The chaos is not rare. It is routine.</p><p>When a man was shot after a police roadblock, the NYPD <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-nypd-shooting-ny-attorney-general-investigating-man-killed-during-attempt-stop-suspected-stolen-car/16298053/>explained their tactics</a>: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t pursue the vehicle, we strategically radioed ahead to shut down traffic to see if we could intercept this car, which we now know was stolen.&rdquo;</p><p>Local leaders have tools. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits. Speed cameras cut speeding and save lives. But the pace is slow. The silence is loud. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who set the rules and walk away. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand safer streets. The DOT can harden crosswalks and build real protection for those outside a car.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.

This program, paused during the pandemic, targets K-12 students across New York City. The contest runs March 6-31, with students creating public-service announcements to promote walking and traffic safety. Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, representing District 46, voiced support: 'I am happy to support the NYC DOT's relaunch of their "We're Walking Here" campaign to raise awareness of our collective responsibility to eliminate all traffic deaths and serious injuries.' The contest partners with the 'Hip Hop 50' campaign, blending street safety with city culture. Winners receive prizes from The Safe Streets Fund. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called students 'some of our most vulnerable pedestrians.'

The bill aimed to amend city law to require the Department of Transportation to finish all street resurfacing work within two weeks. If more time was needed, the department would have to notify the community, stating the reason and new timeline. The matter summary reads: 'ensure that all work associated with the resurfacing of any street is finalized within 2 weeks from the start of work.' Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by thirty other members. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst reviewed the impact, but torn-up streets are a known threat to pedestrians and cyclists. The bill is dead. The hazard lives on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous.
