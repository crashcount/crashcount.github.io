The SUV kept straight. The death was recorded at 7:25 p.m. The city log lists the pedestrian “crossing against signal.” The only fact that matters is he is dead.

The record says “failure to yield.” The victim was a pedestrian at the intersection. Time: 6:46 p.m. Date: January 10, 2025. The city file carries one sharp line: “Apparent Death.” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4785035</a>).</p><h3 id=flatbush-at-hendrickson-night-strike>Flatbush at Hendrickson: night strike</h3><p>Flatbush Avenue.

Pedestrians suffer 612 reported injuries; cyclists, 177. The heaviest hours stack up when families are out: deaths peak at <strong>6 p.m., 7 p.m., 9–11 p.m.</strong> The 6 p.m. hour shows four deaths, the 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. hours add more. Injury counts swell after school and into the night. These are the clock’s hard edges, not opinions. <a href=#>District stats</a> are drawn from the same city feed used above.</p><p>On corridors, the names repeat: <strong>Flatlands Avenue</strong> (2 deaths, 193 injuries), <strong>Utica Avenue</strong> (1 death, 114 injuries), <strong>Avenue L</strong> (1 death, 101 injuries). These are not abstractions. These are blocks.

In the district rollup, speed and other driver actions lumped as “other” coincide with the most deaths and the widest harm. “Failure to yield” shows in the Avenue L killing. “Disregarded traffic control” appears in another fatal. The city’s own breakdown lists pedestrians as the largest share of deaths. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The small-geo analysis</a> gives the counts.</p><h3 id=what-the-clock-demands-now>What the clock demands now</h3><ul><li>Fix the corners that maim: daylight the crosswalks at Flatlands, Utica, and Avenue L; add hardened lefts and leading pedestrian intervals at Seaview and Rockaway; close passing lanes at Kings Highway. These are standard tools the city deploys where people die.</li><li>Target the late hours. The curve from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. carries the highest death load. Put enforcement and calming where the bodies fall.</li><li>Protect walkers first. Pedestrians take most of the deaths here. Treat their space as the priority, not the leftover.</li></ul><h3 id=the-law-can-slow-the-blood>The law can slow the blood</h3><p>Albany passed power to drop speeds citywide. The city can set <strong>20 mph</strong> on local streets. Slower streets spare lives. Our own site explains how to press the officials who hold the pen. See our guide to act now: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>At the state level, senators voted in committee for a bill to force speed limiters on repeat violators.

Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee on June 11–12, 2025, and Senator Roxanne Persaud did too, according to the bill record.

He targets abuse by city officials and fake permits. His bill exempts people with disabilities. Another measure rewards whistleblowers. The Council should pass both. The city’s streets demand it.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2022, Councilman Lincoln Restler (District 33) announced legislation to revoke tens of thousands of personal vehicle parking placards, with exemptions for people with disabilities and those covered by collective bargaining. The editorial, titled 'Free perking: Pull back run amok NYC parking placards,' calls out rampant placard abuse: 'End this scam.' Restler’s companion bill would reward whistleblowers who report cheaters with 25% of fines collected. Both measures have four co-sponsors. The editorial urges the Council to pass the bills and for Mayor Adams to sign them. Placard abuse fuels lawless parking, endangering pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s lack of oversight lets drivers block crosswalks and bike lanes. Restler’s push aims to restore fairness and safety to New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
