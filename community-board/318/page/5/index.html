The DOT can harden crosswalks and build real protection for those outside a car.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.

The bill would require speed-limiting technology for drivers with repeated offenses—those with 11 or more points in 24 months, or six camera tickets in a year.

Streets ran with grief.</p><p class=mb3>According to NY Daily News (published March 30, 2025), Miriam Yarimi drove an Audi with a suspended license and a history of violations—over $11,000 in unpaid tickets, including 21 for speeding and five for running red lights. Police say Yarimi sped through a red light at Ocean Parkway and Quinten Rd., striking Natasha Saada and her three young children as they crossed with the signal. The mother and two daughters died; her son remains hospitalized. Yarimi faces charges including manslaughter, reckless driving, and aggravated unlicensed operation. The article quotes a relative: 'It's a very sensitive time for us, for our community and for our family.' The crash highlights persistent dangers from unlicensed, repeat-offender drivers and the systemic failures that let them remain on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislation eliminates the $250 fine for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals.
