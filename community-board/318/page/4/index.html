The SUV kept straight. The death was recorded at 7:25 p.m. The city log lists the pedestrian “crossing against signal.” The only fact that matters is he is dead.

The record says “failure to yield.” The victim was a pedestrian at the intersection. Time: 6:46 p.m. Date: January 10, 2025. The city file carries one sharp line: “Apparent Death.” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4785035</a>).</p><h3 id=flatbush-at-hendrickson-night-strike>Flatbush at Hendrickson: night strike</h3><p>Flatbush Avenue.

Pedestrians suffer 612 reported injuries; cyclists, 177. The heaviest hours stack up when families are out: deaths peak at <strong>6 p.m., 7 p.m., 9–11 p.m.</strong> The 6 p.m. hour shows four deaths, the 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. hours add more. Injury counts swell after school and into the night. These are the clock’s hard edges, not opinions. <a href=#>District stats</a> are drawn from the same city feed used above.</p><p>On corridors, the names repeat: <strong>Flatlands Avenue</strong> (2 deaths, 193 injuries), <strong>Utica Avenue</strong> (1 death, 114 injuries), <strong>Avenue L</strong> (1 death, 101 injuries). These are not abstractions. These are blocks.

In the district rollup, speed and other driver actions lumped as “other” coincide with the most deaths and the widest harm. “Failure to yield” shows in the Avenue L killing. “Disregarded traffic control” appears in another fatal. The city’s own breakdown lists pedestrians as the largest share of deaths. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The small-geo analysis</a> gives the counts.</p><h3 id=what-the-clock-demands-now>What the clock demands now</h3><ul><li>Fix the corners that maim: daylight the crosswalks at Flatlands, Utica, and Avenue L; add hardened lefts and leading pedestrian intervals at Seaview and Rockaway; close passing lanes at Kings Highway. These are standard tools the city deploys where people die.</li><li>Target the late hours. The curve from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. carries the highest death load. Put enforcement and calming where the bodies fall.</li><li>Protect walkers first. Pedestrians take most of the deaths here. Treat their space as the priority, not the leftover.</li></ul><h3 id=the-law-can-slow-the-blood>The law can slow the blood</h3><p>Albany passed power to drop speeds citywide. The city can set <strong>20 mph</strong> on local streets. Slower streets spare lives. Our own site explains how to press the officials who hold the pen. See our guide to act now: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>At the state level, senators voted in committee for a bill to force speed limiters on repeat violators.

Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee on June 11–12, 2025, and Senator Roxanne Persaud did too, according to the bill record.

The Department of Transportation will fine violators $650 per incident, using in-road sensors to detect excess weight. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Overweight trucks cause wear and tear on our roadways and we all pay the price through expensive repairs to our infrastructure." The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles. Albany has approved expanding this automated system to more city roadways.

The program, which turns routine traffic violations by cyclists into criminal summonses, will go citywide by the end of August. The matter, reported by Streetsblog NYC as 'The Crackdown This Time Edition,' drew sharp criticism from advocates and riders. Council Member Mercedes Narcisse acknowledged drivers as the main threat to pedestrians but called for consideration of drivers in transit deserts. Mayor Adams promised to consult with communities before redesigning streets. Safety analysts warn: expanding this enforcement targets vulnerable road users, discourages cycling, and shifts blame from drivers and infrastructure. The move undermines mode shift and street safety, putting cyclists and pedestrians at greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsored by Senator Andrew Gounardes, the bill passed Senate votes on June 12 and June 13, and cleared the Assembly on June 17. The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly. The bill's technical fixes aim to keep protections in place for children and other vulnerable road users near schools.

The measure, sponsored by Senator Jamaal Bailey, excludes violations in cooperative housing developments with at least 10,000 Mitchell-Lama units from bus operation traffic regulations. The bill advanced through committee and received broad support in both chambers. By exempting these large complexes, the law weakens traffic enforcement where thousands live.

The mayor cited 'community concerns' and stated, 'After several incidents—including some involving children...we decided to adjust the current design.' City Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the move, calling it 'pure politics' and warning, 'He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists.' The article highlights tension between local complaints and street safety policy. No driver error is cited; the crash involved a cyclist and a child. The decision raises questions about how New York responds to vulnerable road users and whether removing infrastructure addresses underlying dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
