Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who set the rules and walk away. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand safer streets. The DOT can harden crosswalks and build real protection for those outside a car.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.

Vulnerable road users still wait.</p><p class=mb3>On May 27, 2025, Canarsie residents and advocates gathered to demand a ferry dock linking their neighborhood to Manhattan. City Council Member Mercedes Narcisse announced plans to introduce a bill mandating ferry service for Canarsie, citing 'a transportation desert' and the need for better connections. Jibreel Jalloh, leading the rally, said, 'We must bridge this gap and demand the connectivity we deserve.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams backed the call, while Sheryl Boyce stressed the need for accessible transit. City Hall said there are no current plans for a new line. According to safety analysts, adding a ferry route mainly improves transit access; without better walking or biking links to the dock, the impact on vulnerable road users remains minimal.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Drivers with too many points or camera tickets must install speed assistance devices. Lawmakers move to curb reckless driving. The bill targets repeat offenders. The aim: fewer crashes, fewer deaths. Streets demand action.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 4045, titled 'Relates to requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits,' advanced in the Senate on May 20, 2025, following a committee vote. The bill requires drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red-light camera tickets in twelve months, to install intelligent speed assistance devices. Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes led the push, joined by co-sponsors Samra Brouk, Cordell Cleare, and others. The vote passed with support from senators including Jeremy Cooney, Pete Harckham, and Jessica Ramos. The measure aims to rein in repeat offenders and reduce deadly speeding. The bill’s language is blunt: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
