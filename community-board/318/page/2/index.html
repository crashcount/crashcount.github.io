The SUV kept straight. The death was recorded at 7:25 p.m. The city log lists the pedestrian “crossing against signal.” The only fact that matters is he is dead.

The record says “failure to yield.” The victim was a pedestrian at the intersection. Time: 6:46 p.m. Date: January 10, 2025. The city file carries one sharp line: “Apparent Death.” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4785035</a>).</p><h3 id=flatbush-at-hendrickson-night-strike>Flatbush at Hendrickson: night strike</h3><p>Flatbush Avenue.

Pedestrians suffer 612 reported injuries; cyclists, 177. The heaviest hours stack up when families are out: deaths peak at <strong>6 p.m., 7 p.m., 9–11 p.m.</strong> The 6 p.m. hour shows four deaths, the 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. hours add more. Injury counts swell after school and into the night. These are the clock’s hard edges, not opinions. <a href=#>District stats</a> are drawn from the same city feed used above.</p><p>On corridors, the names repeat: <strong>Flatlands Avenue</strong> (2 deaths, 193 injuries), <strong>Utica Avenue</strong> (1 death, 114 injuries), <strong>Avenue L</strong> (1 death, 101 injuries). These are not abstractions. These are blocks.

In the district rollup, speed and other driver actions lumped as “other” coincide with the most deaths and the widest harm. “Failure to yield” shows in the Avenue L killing. “Disregarded traffic control” appears in another fatal. The city’s own breakdown lists pedestrians as the largest share of deaths. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The small-geo analysis</a> gives the counts.</p><h3 id=what-the-clock-demands-now>What the clock demands now</h3><ul><li>Fix the corners that maim: daylight the crosswalks at Flatlands, Utica, and Avenue L; add hardened lefts and leading pedestrian intervals at Seaview and Rockaway; close passing lanes at Kings Highway. These are standard tools the city deploys where people die.</li><li>Target the late hours. The curve from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. carries the highest death load. Put enforcement and calming where the bodies fall.</li><li>Protect walkers first. Pedestrians take most of the deaths here. Treat their space as the priority, not the leftover.</li></ul><h3 id=the-law-can-slow-the-blood>The law can slow the blood</h3><p>Albany passed power to drop speeds citywide. The city can set <strong>20 mph</strong> on local streets. Slower streets spare lives. Our own site explains how to press the officials who hold the pen. See our guide to act now: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>At the state level, senators voted in committee for a bill to force speed limiters on repeat violators.

Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee on June 11–12, 2025, and Senator Roxanne Persaud did too, according to the bill record.

Police say the driver "sped through a red light" and fled. Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch. A redesign with protected bike lanes was approved but stalled. State Sen. Gounardes criticized the city's response: "We should all be offended... the response... is a sign that says: 'be careful.'" The article highlights the need for enforcement and infrastructure, noting children must cross nine lanes daily.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
