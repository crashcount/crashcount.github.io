A man, sixty-six, was killed at Rockaway Parkway and Seaview. A motorcyclist, thirty, collided with a fire truck on Flatbush Avenue and never got up again. In the last twelve months, five people died on the streets of Brooklyn CB18. Fourteen more were seriously injured. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. In three years, cars and SUVs killed eleven. Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes and mopeds, none. The streets are not forgiving. The old, the young, the ones just crossing—none are spared.</p><h3 id=the-sound-of-sirens-the-silence-of-leadership>The Sound of Sirens, the Silence of Leadership</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The numbers keep coming. In the past year, there were 1,577 crashes in this district alone. 1,245 people hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are names, faces, empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><p>After a chase ended with a Jeep on the L train tracks, a witness <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/driver-fleeing-cops-brooklyn-subway-station/>described the chaos</a>: &ldquo;Next thing I know, he was into the fence. Absolutely crazy.&rdquo; The chaos is not rare. It is routine.</p><p>When a man was shot after a police roadblock, the NYPD <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-nypd-shooting-ny-attorney-general-investigating-man-killed-during-attempt-stop-suspected-stolen-car/16298053/>explained their tactics</a>: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t pursue the vehicle, we strategically radioed ahead to shut down traffic to see if we could intercept this car, which we now know was stolen.&rdquo;</p><p>Local leaders have tools. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits. Speed cameras cut speeding and save lives. But the pace is slow. The silence is loud. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who set the rules and walk away. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand safer streets. The DOT can harden crosswalks and build real protection for those outside a car.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood on the street is not washed away by words.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A 2004 Ford SUV was making a left turn when it collided with a southbound motorbike traveling straight ahead. The point of impact was the center front end of the SUV and the left front quarter panel of the motorbike. The motorbike driver, a 29-year-old male with a learner's permit, sustained a fractured knee and lower leg injuries, classified as injury severity 3. The motorbike driver was conscious and not ejected from the vehicle. The report lists unspecified contributing factors but highlights the SUV driver's left turn maneuver as the critical action preceding the collision.
