The crash was marked speed‑related; five vehicles were involved, including an unlicensed Mercedes SUV driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>18 people killed</strong> on Brooklyn Community Board 18 streets since 2022.

The victim was in a marked crosswalk when hit (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

Utica Avenue has logged a death and more than a hundred injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Avenue J and Avenue K also rack up high injury counts. These are the places where bodies hit asphalt again and again.</p><p>Named failures appear in the record. “Failure to yield,” “disregarded traffic control,” and “inattention/distraction” run through the case files here, alongside speed in specific crashes like the Jan 27, 2024 boy’s death (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – Crashes</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-does-not-break>The pattern does not break</h3><p>In the last 12 months alone, CB18 logged 2,006 crashes, <strong>6 deaths</strong>, and 1,589 injuries.

We then counted deaths and injuries across all modes, and reviewed factors, hours, and top intersections for CB18. Data was accessed Sep 3, 2025.
