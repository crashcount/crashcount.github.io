The hours around the evening commute and nightfall are the worst: 6 PM through 11 PM account for the most fatalities in CB18, with spikes at 6 PM, 9 PM, 10 PM, and 11 PM (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On Jan 10, 2025, a driver making a left at Avenue L and E 88 Street struck a pedestrian who died at the scene. The victim was in a marked crosswalk when hit (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Jan 31, 2024, an SUV going straight hit and killed a 68‑year‑old at E 105 Street and Glenwood Road (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=flatlands-and-utica-keep-hurting-people>Flatlands and Utica keep hurting people</h3><p>Flatlands Avenue has seen at least two deaths and 193 injuries since 2022. Utica Avenue has logged a death and more than a hundred injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Avenue J and Avenue K also rack up high injury counts. These are the places where bodies hit asphalt again and again.</p><p>Named failures appear in the record. “Failure to yield,” “disregarded traffic control,” and “inattention/distraction” run through the case files here, alongside speed in specific crashes like the Jan 27, 2024 boy’s death (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – Crashes</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-does-not-break>The pattern does not break</h3><p>In the last 12 months alone, CB18 logged 2,006 crashes, <strong>6 deaths</strong>, and 1,589 injuries.

Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill sits with the Assembly. Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Catalina Cruz. Their action signals strong legislative momentum. The bill’s focus: force planners to build streets for people, not just cars. No safety analyst note is available, but the intent is clear—systemic change for vulnerable road users.
