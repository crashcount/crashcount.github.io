Fire bloomed.' A 57-year-old unlicensed man, driving a Ford sedan, was killed—burned to death while strapped in his seat. The Ford was described as 'ash by the time help came.' The crash occurred at 21:45. The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor. The deceased was not ejected and was wearing a lap belt and harness. The data shows the man was unlicensed at the time of the crash. The other vehicle, a Toyota sedan, was also demolished. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.
