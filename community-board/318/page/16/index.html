The SUV kept straight. The death was recorded at 7:25 p.m. The city log lists the pedestrian “crossing against signal.” The only fact that matters is he is dead.

The record says “failure to yield.” The victim was a pedestrian at the intersection. Time: 6:46 p.m. Date: January 10, 2025. The city file carries one sharp line: “Apparent Death.” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4785035</a>).</p><h3 id=flatbush-at-hendrickson-night-strike>Flatbush at Hendrickson: night strike</h3><p>Flatbush Avenue.

Pedestrians suffer 612 reported injuries; cyclists, 177. The heaviest hours stack up when families are out: deaths peak at <strong>6 p.m., 7 p.m., 9–11 p.m.</strong> The 6 p.m. hour shows four deaths, the 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. hours add more. Injury counts swell after school and into the night. These are the clock’s hard edges, not opinions. <a href=#>District stats</a> are drawn from the same city feed used above.</p><p>On corridors, the names repeat: <strong>Flatlands Avenue</strong> (2 deaths, 193 injuries), <strong>Utica Avenue</strong> (1 death, 114 injuries), <strong>Avenue L</strong> (1 death, 101 injuries). These are not abstractions. These are blocks.

In the district rollup, speed and other driver actions lumped as “other” coincide with the most deaths and the widest harm. “Failure to yield” shows in the Avenue L killing. “Disregarded traffic control” appears in another fatal. The city’s own breakdown lists pedestrians as the largest share of deaths. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The small-geo analysis</a> gives the counts.</p><h3 id=what-the-clock-demands-now>What the clock demands now</h3><ul><li>Fix the corners that maim: daylight the crosswalks at Flatlands, Utica, and Avenue L; add hardened lefts and leading pedestrian intervals at Seaview and Rockaway; close passing lanes at Kings Highway. These are standard tools the city deploys where people die.</li><li>Target the late hours. The curve from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. carries the highest death load. Put enforcement and calming where the bodies fall.</li><li>Protect walkers first. Pedestrians take most of the deaths here. Treat their space as the priority, not the leftover.</li></ul><h3 id=the-law-can-slow-the-blood>The law can slow the blood</h3><p>Albany passed power to drop speeds citywide. The city can set <strong>20 mph</strong> on local streets. Slower streets spare lives. Our own site explains how to press the officials who hold the pen. See our guide to act now: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>At the state level, senators voted in committee for a bill to force speed limiters on repeat violators.

Senator Kevin Parker voted yes in committee on June 11–12, 2025, and Senator Roxanne Persaud did too, according to the bill record.

The vote: 40 for, eight against.</p><p class=mb3>On September 26, 2024, the New York City Council passed a modified jaywalking decriminalization bill. The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, cleared the Council with 40 votes in favor and eight against. The bill's summary states it 'legalizes jaywalking, allowing pedestrians to walk into the street outside of crosswalks.' Narcisse stressed, 'Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.' The legislation removes jaywalking as a pretext for police stops, though officers may still intervene for other reasons. The Department of Transportation must now educate the public on street rights and responsibilities. Advocates hailed the bill as historic, but say more must be done to protect pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

Advocates warned new language could blame pedestrians for crashes. The bill would have let people cross mid-block, but now demands they yield to drivers. Racial bias in enforcement remains unaddressed.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2024, the City Council delayed action on a bill to legalize jaywalking. The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with advocates demanding stronger protections for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
