The crash was marked speed‑related; five vehicles were involved, including an unlicensed Mercedes SUV driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>18 people killed</strong> on Brooklyn Community Board 18 streets since 2022. Another <strong>4,421 people were injured</strong> in that span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

The hours around the evening commute and nightfall are the worst: 6 PM through 11 PM account for the most fatalities in CB18, with spikes at 6 PM, 9 PM, 10 PM, and 11 PM (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On Jan 10, 2025, a driver making a left at Avenue L and E 88 Street struck a pedestrian who died at the scene. The victim was in a marked crosswalk when hit (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Jan 31, 2024, an SUV going straight hit and killed a 68‑year‑old at E 105 Street and Glenwood Road (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=flatlands-and-utica-keep-hurting-people>Flatlands and Utica keep hurting people</h3><p>Flatlands Avenue has seen at least two deaths and 193 injuries since 2022. Utica Avenue has logged a death and more than a hundred injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Avenue J and Avenue K also rack up high injury counts. These are the places where bodies hit asphalt again and again.</p><p>Named failures appear in the record. “Failure to yield,” “disregarded traffic control,” and “inattention/distraction” run through the case files here, alongside speed in specific crashes like the Jan 27, 2024 boy’s death (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – Crashes</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-does-not-break>The pattern does not break</h3><p>In the last 12 months alone, CB18 logged 2,006 crashes, <strong>6 deaths</strong>, and 1,589 injuries.

The harm repeats. The hours and corners tell the same story.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have--and-have-not--done>What leaders have — and have not — done</h3><p>City Council Member <a href=/council-district/46/>Mercedes Narcisse</a> backed a crackdown bill on unlicensed commuter vans now in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347‑2025</a>). She also supported decriminalizing jaywalking in 2024, a move aimed at ending biased stops of people on foot (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>At the state level, Senator <a href=/senate-district/21/>Kevin Parker</a> voted yes in committee for the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong>, which would require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with <strong>11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year</strong> (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>; <a href=/take_action/>CrashCount Take Action</a>).

The report lists no specific contributing factors, but the turning maneuver suggests a failure to yield or misjudgment during the left turn.
