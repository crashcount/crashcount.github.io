The hours around the evening commute and nightfall are the worst: 6 PM through 11 PM account for the most fatalities in CB18, with spikes at 6 PM, 9 PM, 10 PM, and 11 PM (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On Jan 10, 2025, a driver making a left at Avenue L and E 88 Street struck a pedestrian who died at the scene. The victim was in a marked crosswalk when hit (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Jan 31, 2024, an SUV going straight hit and killed a 68‑year‑old at E 105 Street and Glenwood Road (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=flatlands-and-utica-keep-hurting-people>Flatlands and Utica keep hurting people</h3><p>Flatlands Avenue has seen at least two deaths and 193 injuries since 2022. Utica Avenue has logged a death and more than a hundred injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Avenue J and Avenue K also rack up high injury counts. These are the places where bodies hit asphalt again and again.</p><p>Named failures appear in the record. “Failure to yield,” “disregarded traffic control,” and “inattention/distraction” run through the case files here, alongside speed in specific crashes like the Jan 27, 2024 boy’s death (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – Crashes</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-does-not-break>The pattern does not break</h3><p>In the last 12 months alone, CB18 logged 2,006 crashes, <strong>6 deaths</strong>, and 1,589 injuries. Year‑to‑date, crashes and injuries are up over last year’s pace in this board: 1,333 crashes, <strong>3 deaths</strong>, and 1,104 injuries vs. 1,075, 2, and 779 at this point last year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Most pedestrians here are struck by sedans and SUVs; trucks show up too, but less often in the pedestrian injury roll‑up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data – Persons</a>). The harm repeats. The hours and corners tell the same story.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have--and-have-not--done>What leaders have — and have not — done</h3><p>City Council Member <a href=/council-district/46/>Mercedes Narcisse</a> backed a crackdown bill on unlicensed commuter vans now in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347‑2025</a>). She also supported decriminalizing jaywalking in 2024, a move aimed at ending biased stops of people on foot (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>At the state level, Senator <a href=/senate-district/21/>Kevin Parker</a> voted yes in committee for the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong>, which would require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with <strong>11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year</strong> (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>; <a href=/take_action/>CrashCount Take Action</a>). Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/59/>Jaime Williams</a> voted yes to extend school‑zone speed enforcement through 2030 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). The tools exist. The crashes keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-would-make-these-corners-safer-now>What would make these corners safer now</h3><ul><li>Daylight the worst intersections on Flatlands Avenue, Utica Avenue, Avenue J, and Avenue K. Give people in the crosswalk a clear line of sight.</li><li>Add leading pedestrian intervals and hardened left turns at Avenue L/E 88 Street and E 105/Glenwood Road, where turning and through drivers have killed.</li><li>Target evening speeding and failure‑to‑yield enforcement where deaths cluster between 6 PM and 11 PM.</li></ul><p>Citywide, the fixes are plain. <strong>Lower the default speed limit to 20 MPH</strong> under local authority and <strong>pass the Stop Super Speeders Act</strong> to slow the tiny share of drivers who do the most harm (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount Take Action</a>; <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</p><p>The boy at Glenwood Road never made it home.

Barriers gone. Riders now face traffic, steel, and risk. The city moves the lane, strips its shield, leaves cyclists exposed.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on July 31, 2025, that city crews began removing a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue between Willoughby and Flushing. The lane, once shielded from traffic, will be replaced with an unprotected version. NY1 notes, 'The lane is being shifted from its current position next to the sidewalk to the other side of parked cars.' This change eliminates the physical barrier that separated cyclists from moving vehicles. The move raises questions about city policy and the safety of vulnerable road users on this busy Brooklyn stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
