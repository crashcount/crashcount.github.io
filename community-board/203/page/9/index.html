The names fade, but the pain does not.</p><p>Just days ago, a woman was killed crossing 174th Street in Morris Heights. The driver fled. Police searched an alleyway for her body. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. The car did not stop. The city did not stop. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/woman-fatally-struck-hit-run-crash-morris-heights-bronx/17460347/>A 44-year-old woman was fatally struck in a hit-and-run crash in the Bronx.</a></p><p>A neighbor saw it. &ldquo;I looked over, and he just rolled over that woman and killed her,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>she said</a>.

In the last year, 62 children were injured. No children were killed. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>over 290 crashes</strong>. Trucks and buses hit too. Even bikes and mopeds left people bleeding. The violence is not random. It is built into the road.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-silence>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Senator Sepúlveda voted yes to extend school speed zones and to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed limiters. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>backed the bill</a> that would force the worst drivers to slow down. Assembly Member Jackson voted to extend speed cameras near schools. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them the deaths are not accidents. Tell them to lower the speed limit, fix the streets, and end the silence. The dead cannot speak. You can. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Status: Amended and advanced by City Council on November 22, 2024. The Council’s action, described as 'watering down' the mayor’s plan, keeps mandatory parking in low-density neighborhoods while ending it in central areas. The matter summary states: 'ending mandatory parking in areas with the best transit while keeping the costly mandate in low-density neighborhoods where it most hinders development.' Council Member Crystal Hudson voted yes, urging all neighborhoods to share the housing burden. Council Member Kevin Riley defended single-family zones. Council Member Rafael Salamanca cited balancing concerns and securing $5 billion for affordable housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso warned of increased housing pressure elsewhere. The Council’s changes preserve car-centric zoning, leaving vulnerable road users exposed and limiting progress on safer, less car-dependent streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
