A black Mercedes comes fast. The car does not stop. It hits him, throws him into the air, drags him half a block. He dies before sunrise. His mother says, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>&ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, four people died in crashes in Bronx CB3.</strong> Fifteen more suffered serious injuries. The dead include a 43-year-old father, a 65-year-old woman, a 31-year-old woman, and a 24-year-old cyclist. <strong>Children are not spared:</strong> 52 kids were hurt, two seriously, in the past year alone.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In this district, sedans and SUVs killed two pedestrians and left 85 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses caused seven serious or moderate injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, three. Bikes, one. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies broken on pavement, families left with empty chairs.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk, Streets Stay Deadly</h2><p>City Hall says it wants zero deaths. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit on most streets is still 25 mph. <strong>The city could drop it to 20 mph today. It has not.</strong></p><p>A neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-fatal-accident-43-year-old-man-killed-hit-run-morrisania/16375922/>urged drivers to slow down and pay attention to pedestrians</a>: &ldquo;We will live longer.&rdquo;</p><p>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, the law that keeps them running comes up for renewal. Each year, the clock ticks down. Meanwhile, the streets run red.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every block. Demand streets that put people before cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable road users caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on DOT street safety projects and Streets Plan implementation. The hearing, led by Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), Christopher Banks (D-Brooklyn), and Rafael Salamanca Jr. (D-Bronx), focused on the DOT's progress under the Streets Plan, which mandates annual targets for protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns. DOT officials defended their process, emphasizing community engagement and prioritizing high-need areas. The council's opposition stands in stark contrast to the projects' proven safety benefits for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
