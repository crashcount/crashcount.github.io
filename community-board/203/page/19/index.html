The names fade, but the pain does not.</p><p>Just days ago, a woman was killed crossing 174th Street in Morris Heights. The driver fled. Police searched an alleyway for her body. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. The car did not stop. The city did not stop. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/woman-fatally-struck-hit-run-crash-morris-heights-bronx/17460347/>A 44-year-old woman was fatally struck in a hit-and-run crash in the Bronx.</a></p><p>A neighbor saw it. &ldquo;I looked over, and he just rolled over that woman and killed her,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>she said</a>.

In the last year, 62 children were injured. No children were killed. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>over 290 crashes</strong>. Trucks and buses hit too. Even bikes and mopeds left people bleeding. The violence is not random. It is built into the road.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-silence>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Senator Sepúlveda voted yes to extend school speed zones and to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed limiters. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>backed the bill</a> that would force the worst drivers to slow down. Assembly Member Jackson voted to extend speed cameras near schools. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them the deaths are not accidents. Tell them to lower the speed limit, fix the streets, and end the silence. The dead cannot speak. You can. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way. The bill targets that risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crackdown aims to stop the chaos.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 988, introduced on April 11, 2023, targets the sale of fake license plates in New York City. The bill, sponsored by Oswald Feliz, Marjorie Velázquez, and Lincoln Restler, amends laws to ban selling counterfeit tags, with fines starting at $1,000 for first offenses and $2,000 for repeat violations. The measure was brought before the City Council and discussed at a City Hall press conference. The matter summary states the bill 'goes after the unscrupulous used car dealers profiting considerably off a huge black market for phony tags.' Restler, as a sponsor, joins efforts to curb the spread of ghost cars, which evade speed cameras and tolls, making streets more dangerous for everyone. Lawmakers stress that the goal is deterrence, not revenue, and call for further action from online marketplaces and federal agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
