In this board, speed shows up in the worst outcomes, including a midnight death of a pedestrian at Webster and E 168th, coded “unsafe speed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>People outside cars pay the price: since 2022, CB3 recorded <strong>332 pedestrian injuries and 4 pedestrian deaths</strong>, plus <strong>137 bicyclist injuries and 2 bicyclist deaths</strong>. At East 167th and Washington, a woman crossing with the signal was killed by a westbound SUV. At East 161st and Melrose, a 24‑year‑old bike rider died after a violent impact with an SUV recorded as unlicensed and bearing Pennsylvania plates.

One thousand trucks a month will vanish from Bronx streets. Boats and cargo bikes will haul food across the city. Less diesel. Fewer big rigs. The city shifts freight off the road, onto water.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, city officials and Con Agg Global announced a new floating freight dock at the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center. The project, backed by the Economic Development Corporation and Council Member Rafael Salamanca, aims to move food by boat and e-cargo trike instead of trucks. The matter summary states: 'Replacing truck trips with boat trips and cargo bikes is a key feature of the city's urgent push to shift cargo trips out of big trucks.' EDC President Andrew Kimball said, 'The goal is, over time, to move more and more of this food out of Hunts Point not by truck, but by water with e-cargo trikes.' The dock will remove one thousand trucks per month from South Bronx streets. Officials plan to expand docks citywide. The bill’s status is an active infrastructure rollout, not a legislative vote. No direct safety analyst assessment was provided, but the shift promises fewer trucks where people walk and ride.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
