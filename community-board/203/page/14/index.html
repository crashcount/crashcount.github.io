The names fade, but the pain does not.</p><p>Just days ago, a woman was killed crossing 174th Street in Morris Heights. The driver fled. Police searched an alleyway for her body. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. The car did not stop. The city did not stop. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/woman-fatally-struck-hit-run-crash-morris-heights-bronx/17460347/>A 44-year-old woman was fatally struck in a hit-and-run crash in the Bronx.</a></p><p>A neighbor saw it. &ldquo;I looked over, and he just rolled over that woman and killed her,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>she said</a>.

In the last year, 62 children were injured. No children were killed. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>over 290 crashes</strong>. Trucks and buses hit too. Even bikes and mopeds left people bleeding. The violence is not random. It is built into the road.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-silence>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Senator Sepúlveda voted yes to extend school speed zones and to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed limiters. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>backed the bill</a> that would force the worst drivers to slow down. Assembly Member Jackson voted to extend speed cameras near schools. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them the deaths are not accidents. Tell them to lower the speed limit, fix the streets, and end the silence. The dead cannot speak. You can. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They claimed community harm, ignoring hard data. Bike lanes and safer streets faced political fire. DOT stood firm, citing lives saved and broad support. Vulnerable road users caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on DOT street safety projects and Streets Plan implementation. The hearing, led by Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), Christopher Banks (D-Brooklyn), and Rafael Salamanca Jr. (D-Bronx), focused on the DOT's progress under the Streets Plan, which mandates annual targets for protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns. DOT officials defended their process, emphasizing community engagement and prioritizing high-need areas. The council's opposition stands in stark contrast to the projects' proven safety benefits for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced February 28, 2024, it amends city code to require the Department of Transportation to expand Open Streets hours on holidays with heavy foot traffic—Memorial Day, Juneteenth, July 4th, Labor Day, Halloween, and others. The bill reads: 'special activation of the Open Streets program on certain holidays and time periods with significant pedestrian traffic.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Brooks-Powers, Louis, Nurse, Ossé, Sanchez, Cabán, Banks, Avilés, Riley, Salaam, Hanif, Feliz, Won, Restler, and Joseph. Community groups can suggest more dates. The city must review all requests under the same standards as regular Open Streets. This bill aims to give people the street when they need it most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
