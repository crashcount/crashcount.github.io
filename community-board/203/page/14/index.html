A black Mercedes comes fast. The car does not stop. It hits him, throws him into the air, drags him half a block. He dies before sunrise. His mother says, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>&ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, four people died in crashes in Bronx CB3.</strong> Fifteen more suffered serious injuries. The dead include a 43-year-old father, a 65-year-old woman, a 31-year-old woman, and a 24-year-old cyclist. <strong>Children are not spared:</strong> 52 kids were hurt, two seriously, in the past year alone.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In this district, sedans and SUVs killed two pedestrians and left 85 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses caused seven serious or moderate injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, three. Bikes, one. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies broken on pavement, families left with empty chairs.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk, Streets Stay Deadly</h2><p>City Hall says it wants zero deaths. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit on most streets is still 25 mph. <strong>The city could drop it to 20 mph today. It has not.</strong></p><p>A neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-fatal-accident-43-year-old-man-killed-hit-run-morrisania/16375922/>urged drivers to slow down and pay attention to pedestrians</a>: &ldquo;We will live longer.&rdquo;</p><p>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, the law that keeps them running comes up for renewal. Each year, the clock ticks down. Meanwhile, the streets run red.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every block. Demand streets that put people before cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill required the NYPD to run tow pound facilities with enough capacity to deter illegal parking and traffic violations. It also mandated annual public reports on tow pound use and enforcement, disaggregated by precinct. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department tow pound capacity.' Council Members Kamillah Hanks (primary sponsor), Oswald Feliz, Sandra Ung, Lincoln Restler, Shaun Abreu, Farah N. Louis, Mercedes Narcisse, and Amanda Farías sponsored the bill. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. No safety analyst assessed the impact for vulnerable road users. The city’s failure to expand towing leaves illegal cars on sidewalks and crosswalks. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The city’s crosswalks remain unchanged. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The map must show disruptions, detours, hazards, and closures in real time. The bill summary states: 'Cyclists deserve the same attention and information already given to the city's drivers and transit riders in the form of notifications, updates, and well-marked detours.' Council Member Carlina Rivera sponsored the bill and led its passage. Rivera and Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt wrote, 'Disruption of any city bikeway requires public information, working detours and operational attention—not just an unheralded shut-down.' The law aims to end the chaos and danger of sudden bike lane closures, giving half a million daily riders the information they need to stay safe and keep moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city had canceled a planned busway after pushback from business owners and Council Member Oswald Feliz, who remains a vocal critic. MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey said, "Our hope is that we DOT stays with us and we're implementing this, hopefully, later this year." MTA CEO Janno Lieber stressed, "We can't deemphasize and under-prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx and also Upper Manhattan who are trying to get east and west across this incredibly busy corridor." DOT spokesperson Vin Barone described a new proposal with dedicated curbside loading and minimal traffic diversions. The city’s earlier pledge for 20 new miles of bus lanes per year has not been met. Eighty-five thousand daily bus riders, many vulnerable, remain at risk on slow, crowded streets.
