A black Mercedes comes fast. The car does not stop. It hits him, throws him into the air, drags him half a block. He dies before sunrise. His mother says, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>&ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, four people died in crashes in Bronx CB3.</strong> Fifteen more suffered serious injuries. The dead include a 43-year-old father, a 65-year-old woman, a 31-year-old woman, and a 24-year-old cyclist. <strong>Children are not spared:</strong> 52 kids were hurt, two seriously, in the past year alone.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In this district, sedans and SUVs killed two pedestrians and left 85 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses caused seven serious or moderate injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, three. Bikes, one. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies broken on pavement, families left with empty chairs.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk, Streets Stay Deadly</h2><p>City Hall says it wants zero deaths. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit on most streets is still 25 mph. <strong>The city could drop it to 20 mph today.

The bill, advanced by the Senate Transportation Committee, proposes 'new security features for temp tags, stricter requirements for car dealers, and harsher penalties for illegal activity.' Ruiz, who sponsored the bill, stressed, 'Tougher regulations and fines are needed to weed out bad actors.' The Motor Vehicle Commission helped develop the proposal and plans its own regulatory overhaul. The New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, represented by Jim Appleton, warned the bill could 'punish or burden the legitimate players.' Similar efforts are underway in Georgia and New York City, where Council Member Oswald Feliz has introduced related bills. The measure aims to close loopholes that let drivers evade accountability, a known risk to public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 23-year-old moped rider was ejected and landed on the pavement, suffering severe bleeding and losing consciousness. He died from his injuries. The sedan’s front end was crushed in the impact. Police cited 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors. The report notes the moped rider was not wearing a helmet, but only after listing the driver’s errors.

Seventeen council members back it. Delivery giants resist. They call it unworkable. Workers face fire risk. City Hall sides with safety. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On November 22, 2023, Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz introduced a bill in the New York City Council requiring delivery companies to provide safe, certified e-bikes and batteries to their workers. The bill, supported by 17 sponsors, aims to curb deadly fires caused by uncertified lithium-ion batteries. The matter summary states, 'Delivery companies are opposing a new bill...that would require them to provide delivery workers with safe, certified e-bikes and batteries.' Feliz, joined by advocates like Ligia Guallpa, argues that companies profit from deliveristas and must bear the cost of safety. Delivery giants Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub oppose the bill, calling it 'simply infeasible' and propose a centralized fund instead. The Adams administration, represented by Carlos Ortiz, supports the bill, insisting business apps are responsible for worker safety. The bill remains under council consideration, with the debate ongoing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law aims to protect delivery workers and consumers from battery fires. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Marjorie Velazquez back new bills requiring app-based delivery companies to provide safe e-bikes and batteries. Velazquez called the bill a 'key' step for safety. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project testified that certified batteries are too expensive and in short supply. Delivery workers, facing high costs and legal threats, often keep using unsafe batteries or turn to gas-powered mopeds. App companies resist, citing worker status and costs. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection has started enforcement, but the core danger persists: safe batteries are out of reach for many, leaving workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
