Thirty seriously hurt.</strong> That is the count in Bronx CB3 since 2022. The numbers do not tell you about the bodies in the street, the sirens at dawn, the families waiting in hospital halls. They do not tell you about the man dragged under a car for 950 feet, or the worker pinned between two vehicles and left to die. But the numbers do not lie. The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just last month, a driver in Morrisania struck and killed a car wash worker, then ran. It took two years to make an arrest.

State Senator Sepúlveda <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones</a>. But the carnage continues. The city took seventeen years to fund a fix for one deadly intersection.

This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another day of blood. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders.
