Streets grow deadlier.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2023, lawmakers in New Jersey and Georgia responded to a Streetsblog investigation exposing widespread temporary license plate fraud. New Jersey Assembly Member Paul Moriarty called the findings "disturbing" and is drafting a bill to raise fines and consider criminal penalties for dealers. Assembly Member Clinton Calabrese is working with state agencies to fix regulatory gaps. In Georgia, Rep. John Corbett, chair of the Motor Vehicles Committee, plans to introduce legislation, while Sen. Josh McLaurin urges stronger regulatory enforcement to block bad actors. Sen. Sonya Halpern called Georgia's role in the black market "concerning." The matter centers on the illegal sale and use of temp tags, which, as safe streets advocate Jimmy Lee warns, embolden reckless drivers and make streets more dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.

The crackdown aims to stop reckless, untraceable cars haunting city streets.</p><p class=mb3>Bronx Councilman Oswald Feliz introduced a legislative proposal on April 9, 2023, targeting fraudulent paper license plates, known as 'ghost cars.' The bill, not yet assigned a committee or status, seeks to impose a $1,000 fine for first-time sellers of fake plates and at least $2,000 for repeat offenders. Motorists caught driving with fraudulent plates would face a $500 fine for a first offense and $1,000 for subsequent violations, up from the current $65–$200 range. Feliz said, 'The plates are encouraging reckless behavior in our communities, and we must crack down on them.' The measure also calls for online marketplaces to remove fake plate listings and urges federal standards for more secure temporary plates. Feliz’s push follows police crackdowns and rising use of ghost cars for crimes and traffic violations. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
