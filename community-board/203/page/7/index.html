The riders, Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, were thrown and later died at local hospitals. Prosecutors charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He refused a chemical test, according to the complaint. “He was drunk,” a victim’s sister said outside court. “Two people were killed.” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> and the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Daily News</a> reported the charges and the family’s grief.</p><p>This crash sits just north of Bronx Community Board 3.

SUVs and sedans dominate the harm to people on foot: sedans and SUVs account for <strong>220+ pedestrian injuries and 3 pedestrian deaths</strong>, while trucks and buses add more serious injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Crashes peak after dark and into the night.

In this board, speed shows up in the worst outcomes, including a midnight death of a pedestrian at Webster and E 168th, coded “unsafe speed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>People outside cars pay the price: since 2022, CB3 recorded <strong>332 pedestrian injuries and 4 pedestrian deaths</strong>, plus <strong>137 bicyclist injuries and 2 bicyclist deaths</strong>. At East 167th and Washington, a woman crossing with the signal was killed by a westbound SUV. At East 161st and Melrose, a 24‑year‑old bike rider died after a violent impact with an SUV recorded as unlicensed and bearing Pennsylvania plates.

The police report lists 'Pavement Slippery' and 'Brakes Defective' as contributing factors to the crash. No driver error beyond these mechanical and environmental failures is cited, but the systemic danger is clear: a vehicle unable to stop, a vulnerable pedestrian left exposed, and a city street transformed into a site of trauma.

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car."
