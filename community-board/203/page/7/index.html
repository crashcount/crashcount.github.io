A black Mercedes comes fast. The car does not stop. It hits him, throws him into the air, drags him half a block. He dies before sunrise. His mother says, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>&ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, four people died in crashes in Bronx CB3.</strong> Fifteen more suffered serious injuries. The dead include a 43-year-old father, a 65-year-old woman, a 31-year-old woman, and a 24-year-old cyclist. <strong>Children are not spared:</strong> 52 kids were hurt, two seriously, in the past year alone.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In this district, sedans and SUVs killed two pedestrians and left 85 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses caused seven serious or moderate injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, three. Bikes, one. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies broken on pavement, families left with empty chairs.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk, Streets Stay Deadly</h2><p>City Hall says it wants zero deaths. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit on most streets is still 25 mph. <strong>The city could drop it to 20 mph today. It has not.</strong></p><p>A neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-fatal-accident-43-year-old-man-killed-hit-run-morrisania/16375922/>urged drivers to slow down and pay attention to pedestrians</a>: &ldquo;We will live longer.&rdquo;</p><p>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, the law that keeps them running comes up for renewal. Each year, the clock ticks down. Meanwhile, the streets run red.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every block. Demand streets that put people before cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, discussed in the Municipal Services Committee, would force cars and taxis to turn off, leaving the lane for buses, trucks, and emergency vehicles. The matter summary notes, 'The Bx36 bus, which travels this corridor, is among the slowest in the Bronx, with speeds dropping to as low as 4.5 miles per hour.' Council Members Pierina Sanchez and Oswald Feliz, who represent the area, expressed cautious optimism and called for community engagement. Committee Chair Lucia Deng reported, 'There was zero pushback on the concept of busways or bus lanes.' The committee even pushed for a longer route. DOT will conduct further analysis and present detailed plans to local boards in the fall.
