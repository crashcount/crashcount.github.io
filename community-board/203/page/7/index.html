Thirty seriously hurt.</strong> That is the count in Bronx CB3 since 2022. The numbers do not tell you about the bodies in the street, the sirens at dawn, the families waiting in hospital halls. They do not tell you about the man dragged under a car for 950 feet, or the worker pinned between two vehicles and left to die. But the numbers do not lie. The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just last month, a driver in Morrisania struck and killed a car wash worker, then ran. It took two years to make an arrest.

State Senator Sepúlveda <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones</a>. But the carnage continues. The city took seventeen years to fund a fix for one deadly intersection.

This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another day of blood. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders.

Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz stated, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz highlighted the broader issue: "We’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced." The incident underscores the risks posed by illegal parking and the need for stricter enforcement and infrastructure checks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She was crossing with the pedestrian signal when struck by a 2006 Subaru pickup truck traveling east and making a right turn. The report notes no damage to the vehicle, suggesting a low-impact collision. The pedestrian sustained injuries to her knee, lower leg, and foot, and was conscious with internal complaints. The report lists unspecified contributing factors for the pedestrian but does not identify any driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding. The absence of vehicle damage and the pedestrian crossing with the signal highlight systemic dangers at intersections even when victims follow crossing rules.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
