The names fade, but the pain does not.</p><p>Just days ago, a woman was killed crossing 174th Street in Morris Heights. The driver fled. Police searched an alleyway for her body. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. The car did not stop. The city did not stop. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/woman-fatally-struck-hit-run-crash-morris-heights-bronx/17460347/>A 44-year-old woman was fatally struck in a hit-and-run crash in the Bronx.</a></p><p>A neighbor saw it. &ldquo;I looked over, and he just rolled over that woman and killed her,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>she said</a>.

In the last year, 62 children were injured. No children were killed. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>over 290 crashes</strong>. Trucks and buses hit too. Even bikes and mopeds left people bleeding. The violence is not random. It is built into the road.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-silence>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Senator Sepúlveda voted yes to extend school speed zones and to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed limiters. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>backed the bill</a> that would force the worst drivers to slow down. Assembly Member Jackson voted to extend speed cameras near schools. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them the deaths are not accidents. Tell them to lower the speed limit, fix the streets, and end the silence. The dead cannot speak. You can. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill bars sales to unlicensed, uninsured buyers. It also folds scooter safety into driver education. No safety analyst has weighed in on the impact for vulnerable road users.

A pickup truck was making a U-turn when it collided with a moped traveling northbound. The moped rider, a 58-year-old male, was ejected from his vehicle and sustained a head injury resulting in a concussion and incoherence. The report cites 'View Obstructed/Limited' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors to the crash. The pickup truck, driven by a licensed female driver, showed no damage despite impact on its left side doors. The moped sustained damage to its center front end. The report highlights driver errors related to limited visibility and unsafe speed but does not attribute fault to the moped rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
