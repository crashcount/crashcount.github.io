The names fade, but the pain does not.</p><p>Just days ago, a woman was killed crossing 174th Street in Morris Heights. The driver fled. Police searched an alleyway for her body. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. The car did not stop. The city did not stop. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/woman-fatally-struck-hit-run-crash-morris-heights-bronx/17460347/>A 44-year-old woman was fatally struck in a hit-and-run crash in the Bronx.</a></p><p>A neighbor saw it. &ldquo;I looked over, and he just rolled over that woman and killed her,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>she said</a>.

In the last year, 62 children were injured. No children were killed. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—<strong>over 290 crashes</strong>. Trucks and buses hit too. Even bikes and mopeds left people bleeding. The violence is not random. It is built into the road.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-silence>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Senator Sepúlveda voted yes to extend school speed zones and to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed limiters. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>backed the bill</a> that would force the worst drivers to slow down. Assembly Member Jackson voted to extend speed cameras near schools. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them the deaths are not accidents. Tell them to lower the speed limit, fix the streets, and end the silence. The dead cannot speak.
