Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck two motorcycles. The riders, Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, were thrown and later died at local hospitals. Prosecutors charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He refused a chemical test, according to the complaint. “He was drunk,” a victim’s sister said outside court. “Two people were killed.” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> and the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Daily News</a> reported the charges and the family’s grief.</p><p>This crash sits just north of Bronx Community Board 3.

SUVs and sedans dominate the harm to people on foot: sedans and SUVs account for <strong>220+ pedestrian injuries and 3 pedestrian deaths</strong>, while trucks and buses add more serious injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Crashes peak after dark and into the night.

In this board, speed shows up in the worst outcomes, including a midnight death of a pedestrian at Webster and E 168th, coded “unsafe speed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>People outside cars pay the price: since 2022, CB3 recorded <strong>332 pedestrian injuries and 4 pedestrian deaths</strong>, plus <strong>137 bicyclist injuries and 2 bicyclist deaths</strong>. At East 167th and Washington, a woman crossing with the signal was killed by a westbound SUV. At East 161st and Melrose, a 24‑year‑old bike rider died after a violent impact with an SUV recorded as unlicensed and bearing Pennsylvania plates.
