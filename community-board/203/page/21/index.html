The riders, Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, were thrown and later died at local hospitals. Prosecutors charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He refused a chemical test, according to the complaint. “He was drunk,” a victim’s sister said outside court. “Two people were killed.” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> and the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Daily News</a> reported the charges and the family’s grief.</p><p>This crash sits just north of Bronx Community Board 3.

In this board, speed shows up in the worst outcomes, including a midnight death of a pedestrian at Webster and E 168th, coded “unsafe speed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>People outside cars pay the price: since 2022, CB3 recorded <strong>332 pedestrian injuries and 4 pedestrian deaths</strong>, plus <strong>137 bicyclist injuries and 2 bicyclist deaths</strong>. At East 167th and Washington, a woman crossing with the signal was killed by a westbound SUV. At East 161st and Melrose, a 24‑year‑old bike rider died after a violent impact with an SUV recorded as unlicensed and bearing Pennsylvania plates.
