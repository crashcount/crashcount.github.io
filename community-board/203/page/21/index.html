The violence does not stop at a line on a map.</p><p>—</p><h3 id=where-the-street-hits-back>Where the street hits back</h3><p>In CB3 since 2022, there have been <strong>2,634 crashes</strong>, leaving <strong>1,641 injured</strong> and <strong>12 dead</strong>. SUVs and sedans dominate the harm to people on foot: sedans and SUVs account for <strong>220+ pedestrian injuries and 3 pedestrian deaths</strong>, while trucks and buses add more serious injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Crashes peak after dark and into the night. The worst hours include midnight, 1 a.m., 3 a.m., and a surge at the <strong>9–10 p.m.</strong> and <strong>8–9 p.m.</strong> hours, with another spike at <strong>5 a.m.</strong> The 9 p.m. hour alone saw 81 injuries; at 5 a.m., two people died. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On the map, certain names repeat. <strong>East 163rd Street</strong> leads with 62 injuries. <strong>Webster Avenue</strong> appears twice among the top sites, with more than 70 injuries across entries. Park Avenue and Southern Boulevard carry deaths. These are not secrets. They are addresses. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>—</p><h3 id=what-kills-here>What kills here</h3><p>The city’s roll‑up pins much of the damage on “other” driver error, with smaller shares labeled failure to yield, inattention, disregarding signals, and unsafe speed. In this board, speed shows up in the worst outcomes, including a midnight death of a pedestrian at Webster and E 168th, coded “unsafe speed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>People outside cars pay the price: since 2022, CB3 recorded <strong>332 pedestrian injuries and 4 pedestrian deaths</strong>, plus <strong>137 bicyclist injuries and 2 bicyclist deaths</strong>. At East 167th and Washington, a woman crossing with the signal was killed by a westbound SUV. At East 161st and Melrose, a 24‑year‑old bike rider died after a violent impact with an SUV recorded as unlicensed and bearing Pennsylvania plates. These are lines from police forms, not poems. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>—</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-slow-the-cars>Fix the corners, slow the cars</h3><p>Start where the harm clusters.</p><ul><li>Daylight and harden turns at <strong>East 163rd Street</strong> and along <strong>Webster Avenue</strong>.
