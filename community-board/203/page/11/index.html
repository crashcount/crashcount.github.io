A black Mercedes comes fast. The car does not stop. It hits him, throws him into the air, drags him half a block. He dies before sunrise. His mother says, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>&ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, four people died in crashes in Bronx CB3.</strong> Fifteen more suffered serious injuries. The dead include a 43-year-old father, a 65-year-old woman, a 31-year-old woman, and a 24-year-old cyclist. <strong>Children are not spared:</strong> 52 kids were hurt, two seriously, in the past year alone.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In this district, sedans and SUVs killed two pedestrians and left 85 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses caused seven serious or moderate injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, three. Bikes, one. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies broken on pavement, families left with empty chairs.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk, Streets Stay Deadly</h2><p>City Hall says it wants zero deaths. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit on most streets is still 25 mph. <strong>The city could drop it to 20 mph today. It has not.</strong></p><p>A neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-fatal-accident-43-year-old-man-killed-hit-run-morrisania/16375922/>urged drivers to slow down and pay attention to pedestrians</a>: &ldquo;We will live longer.&rdquo;</p><p>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, the law that keeps them running comes up for renewal. Each year, the clock ticks down. Meanwhile, the streets run red.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every block. Demand streets that put people before cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates vow to watch.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2024, the New York City Council and Mayor Adams' administration agreed to pursue regulation of last-mile delivery warehouses. The deal emerged during negotiations over the 'City of Yes for Economic Opportunity' zoning plan, which the Council approved. The matter summary notes, 'the administration has pledged to support future legislation to cut pollution from these warehouses and propose rules to restrict new facilities.' Councilmember Alexa Avilés (District 38) and 28 colleagues sent a letter demanding stricter oversight. Avilés and advocates want special permits and environmental reviews to protect neighborhoods from traffic, pollution, and safety hazards. Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer promised a bill empowering the Department of Environmental Protection to regulate warehouse vehicle emissions. Councilmember Rafael Salamanca Jr. stressed the Council’s leverage: 'It gets to a point where you have to use your power of voting to get the attention of the city.' The City Planning Commission and Council must vote again before rules take effect. Advocates and councilmembers will monitor the administration’s follow-through.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more hiding the truth.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0745-2024, now enacted, came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced April 11, 2024, and became law September 14, 2024, as Local Law 88. The law’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Schulman, Hudson, Restler, and others. The law forces DOT to publish monthly and annual data on bike and micromobility use, plus crash and safety project details. The city must show where riders go, where danger lurks, and what it does to fix it. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it stands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill reads: “prohibiting the parking, standing, stopping, or operation of a motor vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates.” Council Member Oswald Feliz leads, joined by Holden, Bottcher, Gennaro, Marte, Restler, Ung, and Paladino. The bill sets fines up to $1,000 and possible jail for violators. Each offense is a misdemeanor. The council aims to strip cover for reckless drivers, making it harder to dodge tickets and accountability. No safety analyst note yet, but the intent is clear: end the shield for lawless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
