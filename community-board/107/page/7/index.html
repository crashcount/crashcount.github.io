A girl rides her bike. A mother waits for the light. In Manhattan CB7, these moments end in blood too often. In the last twelve months, five people died and nine suffered serious injuries on these streets. The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, and a 74-year-old cyclist. More than 300 people were hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old, walking or riding, careful or distracted. They only count the bodies.</p><h2 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h2><p>Miriam Reinharth was crossing Amsterdam Avenue at 96th Street. She did not make it to the other side. The ambulance driver who struck her was charged with failure to yield. &ldquo;The police officer said the accident was not Miriam&rsquo;s fault at all,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>said her husband, Steven Greenhouse</a>. A 13-year-old girl was killed by an SUV on Cathedral Parkway. Her name is not in the data. Her absence is.</p><p>Darnell Sealy-McCrorey stood with other grieving families and said, &ldquo;This epidemic is preventable.

Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council and DOT can act now. But the limit stands. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in question. The city builds more bike lanes and redesigns intersections, but the work is slow. The NYPD cracks down on e-bike riders with criminal summonses, while drivers who kill often walk away. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected crossings. Demand that speed cameras stay on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The board demanded real solutions, not empty gestures or propaganda.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. On December 10, 2024, Manhattan Community Board 2’s transportation and parks committees reviewed Council Member Vickie Paladino’s proposal to ban e-bikes from city parks. The committees voted overwhelmingly against it. The matter, described as an effort to 'make it more harmonious and safer for people in parks,' was criticized as 'not fleshed out.' Paladino, a Queens Republican, failed to provide data or address existing rules. Co-sponsor Gale Brewer admitted she signed on under pressure and doubted enforcement. Committee members Shirley Secunda, Susanna Aaron, Janet Liff, and Jeannine Kiely all voiced strong opposition, calling the bill redundant and inadequate. The Central Park Conservancy declined to endorse a ban, urging more protected bike lanes instead. The board found the proposal did nothing for safety and ignored systemic issues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New contract would allow more tourist flights if half use electric aircraft. Advocates and Council Member Restler slam the move. They demand a ban on non-essential, luxury air travel.</p><p class=mb3>On December 9, 2024, the city released a draft contract proposing to lift the cap on helicopter flights at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport. The Economic Development Corporation, which manages the heliport, seeks to allow more flights if 50 percent use electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), pending FAA approval. The matter summary states: 'The city could lift a years-old cap on helicopter trips at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in order to get companies to pivot to electric aircraft.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing Brooklyn waterfront neighborhoods, criticized the plan and called for a ban on non-essential tourism and luxury air taxi flights. Restler previously introduced legislation to ban such trips, but it failed. Advocates Melissa Elstein and Andrew Rosenthal of Stop The Chop also oppose the plan, citing noise, quality of life, and expanded luxury service. The contract includes expanded lounges and segregated passenger flows, which advocates see as a move to boost luxury air travel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
