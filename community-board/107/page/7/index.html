Trucks unload cargo. E-cargo bikes and hand carts finish the job. Fewer trucks double-park. Streets clear. Council Member Gale Brewer backs the move. The city tests safer, cleaner delivery.</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2025, the NYC Department of Transportation launched a microhub pilot on the Upper West Side. The program opened three delivery hubs at Amsterdam Avenue at 85th Street, Amsterdam at 73rd Street, and Broadway at 77th Street. According to the DOT, these hubs are part of a three-year pilot under the Curb Management Action Plan. The official matter summary states: 'The DOT unveiled three new microhubs to promote cleaner, greener, last-mile deliveries.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, applauded the initiative, saying, 'It is incredibly important to have these hubs where we can pull the trucks off the streets and get the delivery via bicycle.' The pilot aims to cut truck congestion, reduce double parking, and shift deliveries to low-emission modes. Delivery giants like Amazon and UPS will use the hubs. The city hopes to make streets safer for everyone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Deborah Glick with co-sponsors Jo Anne Simon, John Zaccaro Jr., Linda Rosenthal, and Tony Simone, was introduced on April 16, 2025. It 'permits the use of photo speed violation monitoring systems in New York City for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction, concealment, and/or distortion; extends provisions permitting the use of speed cameras in certain school zones.' By targeting plate obstruction, the bill seeks to stop drivers from dodging speed camera enforcement, a move that could help protect pedestrians and cyclists from repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsors want sharper eyes on reckless drivers. School zones stay under watch. The city’s most vulnerable stay exposed.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 7336, now in sponsorship, aims to expand photo speed violation monitoring in New York City. The bill, titled 'Relates to the use of certain photo speed violation monitoring systems for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction; repealer,' lets cameras catch drivers who hide or alter plates and extends speed camera use in school zones. Senator Andrew Gounardes leads, joined by Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Luis R. Sepúlveda. The bill’s focus: more enforcement, less evasion. No safety analyst note yet, but the intent is clear—more eyes on the street, more pressure on reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
