Eleven left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, the streets of Manhattan CB7 have not spared the old or the young. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was struck and killed by an SUV. A 13-year-old girl died crossing Manhattan Avenue. A 74-year-old cyclist, helmet on, was killed at West End and 70th. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, families left with empty chairs.</p><p><strong>In the past year alone, crashes rose 17%. Deaths jumped from one to five.</strong> Serious injuries climbed. The dead are mostly pedestrians and cyclists. The killers are cars, trucks, SUVs. The city counts the bodies. The city waits.</p><h3 id=why-didnt-he-stop>&ldquo;Why Didn&rsquo;t He Stop?&rdquo;</h3><p>A woman stood on the street, horn blaring, as a driver kept coming. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he stop?

State Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Brad Hoylman-Sigal</a> voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Both voted to extend school speed zones. But the default speed limit is still not 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers still roam free. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save you unless you make it.</strong> Call your council member.

The program opened three delivery hubs at Amsterdam Avenue at 85th Street, Amsterdam at 73rd Street, and Broadway at 77th Street. According to the DOT, these hubs are part of a three-year pilot under the Curb Management Action Plan. The official matter summary states: 'The DOT unveiled three new microhubs to promote cleaner, greener, last-mile deliveries.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, applauded the initiative, saying, 'It is incredibly important to have these hubs where we can pull the trucks off the streets and get the delivery via bicycle.' The pilot aims to cut truck congestion, reduce double parking, and shift deliveries to low-emission modes. Delivery giants like Amazon and UPS will use the hubs.

Lawmakers push to close loopholes that shield reckless drivers from accountability.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly bill A 7997, now in sponsorship, aims to expand photo speed violation monitoring in New York City. The bill, sponsored by Deborah Glick with co-sponsors Jo Anne Simon, John Zaccaro Jr., Linda Rosenthal, and Tony Simone, was introduced on April 16, 2025. It 'permits the use of photo speed violation monitoring systems in New York City for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction, concealment, and/or distortion; extends provisions permitting the use of speed cameras in certain school zones.' By targeting plate obstruction, the bill seeks to stop drivers from dodging speed camera enforcement, a move that could help protect pedestrians and cyclists from repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
