Eleven left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, the streets of Manhattan CB7 have not spared the old or the young. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was struck and killed by an SUV. A 13-year-old girl died crossing Manhattan Avenue. A 74-year-old cyclist, helmet on, was killed at West End and 70th. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, families left with empty chairs.</p><p><strong>In the past year alone, crashes rose 17%. Deaths jumped from one to five.</strong> Serious injuries climbed. The dead are mostly pedestrians and cyclists. The killers are cars, trucks, SUVs. The city counts the bodies. The city waits.</p><h3 id=why-didnt-he-stop>&ldquo;Why Didn&rsquo;t He Stop?&rdquo;</h3><p>A woman stood on the street, horn blaring, as a driver kept coming. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he stop?

State Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Brad Hoylman-Sigal</a> voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Both voted to extend school speed zones. But the default speed limit is still not 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers still roam free. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save you unless you make it.</strong> Call your council member.

No summons was issued to the driver or passenger for the illegal act. The area, plagued by 913 crashes in three years, has injured dozens of cyclists and pedestrians. Council Member Erik Bottcher and State Senator Brad Hoylman responded by rallying with advocacy groups, demanding protected bike lanes on 10th and 11th avenues. Hoylman tweeted, 'The City must make the streets of the West Side safer!' The Hudson River Greenway, a nearby bike path, bans legal e-bikes, forcing riders like Kwan onto dangerous streets. This was the city’s first cyclist death of 2022, amid a rising toll of road fatalities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer</p><p class=mb3>On February 14, 2022, Council Member Adrienne Adams (District 28) was mentioned in a Streetsblog analysis titled, "New York’s Speed Cameras Aren’t Racist — But the City’s Road Design Is." The report, not tied to a specific bill, reviewed automated enforcement and street design. It found speed cameras are evenly distributed and reduce crashes, but dangerous road design still puts lives at risk. Adams and other leaders called for more cameras and urgent street redesigns, echoing the article’s summary: 'Cameras have led to fewer crashes, injuries, and fatalities, but high numbers of tickets in some neighborhoods are attributed to unsafe road design, not camera placement.' Community voices stressed that automated enforcement helps, but cannot replace permanent fixes to deadly streets. The Department of Transportation’s lack of transparency on camera locations remains a concern. Adams and others demand systemic change to protect vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Leaders demand street fixes, not just enforcement.</p><p class=mb3>""I want all the red light cameras I can get."" -- Gale A. Brewer</p><p class=mb3>This Streetsblog NYC analysis, published February 14, 2022, reviews New York’s speed and red light camera programs. The report finds, “New York City's speed cameras are evenly distributed and not disproportionately concentrated in low-income communities of color.” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards says, “Cameras don't discriminate.” Marco Conner DiAquoi of Transportation Alternatives adds, “We don’t see any correlation between the demographics of a zip code and the number of speeding violations there.” Council Member Gale Brewer calls for more red light cameras. Wilfredo Florentino, Brooklyn Community Board 5, says, “Just placing cameras ain't gonna cut it.” The analysis shows that dangerous, wide arterials in communities of color drive up traffic violence. Advocates and officials agree: automated enforcement helps, but only street redesigns will end the bloodshed. The Department of Transportation still withholds exact camera locations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hall remains bare.</p><p class=mb3>On February 4, 2022, a group of Manhattan elected officials, including State Senator Brad Hoylman, sent a letter demanding public seating at Moynihan Train Hall. The matter, titled 'Legislators Demand Public Seating at the Moynihan Train Hall,' highlights the lack of benches in the busy transit hub. The letter states, 'To ensure everyone can enjoy this public good, we request the installation of additional seating.' Lawmakers Hoylman, Nadler, Jackson, Gottfried, Levine, and Bottcher signed the letter. They note that the small waiting area for ticketed passengers is not enough, forcing travelers—especially seniors—to sit on the floor or wander in search of a seat. The officials reject exclusionary design that targets unhoused people, urging services and outreach instead. Amtrak has not responded. The push for seating centers the needs of all passengers, especially the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan), would ban cities from forcing developers to build off-street parking in new projects. The bill, considered as of January 31, 2022, is under review by the state legislature. The measure, described as aiming to 'encourage public transit use, reduce car ownership, and address climate change,' would give New York City 180 days to update zoning if passed. Sen. Hoylman, the sponsor, calls parking minimums 'backwards' and a barrier to affordable housing. Sen. Alessandra Biaggi (D-Bronx) has shown support for similar efforts. The Department of City Planning and the governor's office will review the legislation if it advances. The bill does not ban parking outright, but removes the mandate, letting developers decide.
