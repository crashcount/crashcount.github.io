Year to date: 5 deaths and 260 injuries. Crashes rose more than 21% over last year’s pace (city data).</p><h3 id=where-it-keeps-happening>Where it keeps happening</h3><p>Henry Hudson Parkway is the deadliest stretch in CB7: 2 people killed and 224 injured. Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue stack injury after injury. The worst hour is late afternoon: 4 p.m. alone saw 99 injuries in this period (city data).</p><p>Top contributing factors in CB7 include driver inattention/distraction, disregarding traffic control, failure to yield and unsafe speed. Private cars and SUVs cause most harm: SUVs account for 81 pedestrian injuries, including 4 deaths; sedans account for 77 pedestrian injuries (city data).</p><p>Fixes are not exotic. Make them local and fast: daylighting and leading pedestrian intervals on Broadway and Amsterdam; protected intersections and raised crosswalks near schools and senior centers; automated speed control, hardened lanes and targeted enforcement on Henry Hudson Parkway and at late-afternoon peaks.</p><h3 id=leaders-on-the-record>Leaders, on the record</h3><p>When DOT rolled out paid curb parking across 13 Upper West Side blocks overnight, the agency said, “Demand for curb space in the city is increasing, from trash collection and bike lanes to truck loading and parking” (West Side Spirit). CB7’s district manager said, “They didn’t provide a ton of notice” (West Side Spirit).</p><p>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery, the transportation commissioner said, “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection” (Gothamist). The Upper West Side needs that same urgency on Broadway and Amsterdam.</p><h3 id=whats-been-done--and-whats-missing>What’s been done — and what’s missing</h3><p>State Sen. Brad Hoylman‑Sigal voted yes in committee on S 4045, a bill to require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for repeat violators. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal co-sponsored the Assembly companion (A 2299) and backed measures to expand camera enforcement (A 7997). These moves matter. But CB7 still needs a citywide 20 mph default under Sammy’s Law and faster, physical turn‑calming on our deadly corners (policy and city data).</p><h3 id=do-not-look-away>Do not look away</h3><p>This is fixable. Push for daylighting and LPIs on Broadway and Amsterdam. Demand protected intersections and raised crossings by schools and senior centers. Insist on automated speed control and hardened lanes on Henry Hudson Parkway and targeted enforcement at the 4 p.m. peak. And press Albany and City Hall to use Sammy’s Law to set a 20 mph default citywide and to require speed limiters for habitual speeders.</p><p>Start here: /take_action/.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Drivers idle near playgrounds, hospitals. Danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2022, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) held a public hearing on a proposed rule change to New York City's vehicle idling law. The change would broaden the definition of 'processing device,' letting more vehicles idle legally. Manhattan Community Board 4 voted unanimously to reject the change, warning, 'These exemptions... would create an argument that just about any activity that requires power in a vehicle is an idling defense.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman testified, 'Drivers most often idle in front of highly trafficked pedestrian areas... those that live near large roadways face serious health repercussions.' Advocates, residents, and Dr. Patrick Schnell all opposed the proposal, citing health and environmental harm. Spectrum requested a variance, but all testimony opposed it. The DEP claims the change clarifies the law, but enforcement is already weak and large companies are frequent violators. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, still in early stages, aims to ban advertising of rapid delivery times. The matter summary reads: 'ban apps from advertising quick delivery times, arguing they encourage delivery workers to break traffic laws and endanger themselves and pedestrians.' Brewer also pressed for enforcement against 'dark stores' operating in retail zones. She criticized Gorillas' changes as cosmetic, saying, 'They're doing this just to conform [to zoning rules] but it's not really their model.' Councilman Christopher Marte is leading the bill. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the council’s focus is clear: speed kills, and zoning violations breed chaos.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hoylman tweeted, 'The City must make the streets of the West Side safer!' The Hudson River Greenway, a nearby bike path, bans legal e-bikes, forcing riders like Kwan onto dangerous streets.

The report, not tied to a specific bill, reviewed automated enforcement and street design. It found speed cameras are evenly distributed and reduce crashes, but dangerous road design still puts lives at risk. Adams and other leaders called for more cameras and urgent street redesigns, echoing the article’s summary: 'Cameras have led to fewer crashes, injuries, and fatalities, but high numbers of tickets in some neighborhoods are attributed to unsafe road design, not camera placement.' Community voices stressed that automated enforcement helps, but cannot replace permanent fixes to deadly streets. The Department of Transportation’s lack of transparency on camera locations remains a concern. Adams and others demand systemic change to protect vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report finds, “New York City's speed cameras are evenly distributed and not disproportionately concentrated in low-income communities of color.” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards says, “Cameras don't discriminate.” Marco Conner DiAquoi of Transportation Alternatives adds, “We don’t see any correlation between the demographics of a zip code and the number of speeding violations there.” Council Member Gale Brewer calls for more red light cameras. Wilfredo Florentino, Brooklyn Community Board 5, says, “Just placing cameras ain't gonna cut it.” The analysis shows that dangerous, wide arterials in communities of color drive up traffic violence. Advocates and officials agree: automated enforcement helps, but only street redesigns will end the bloodshed. The Department of Transportation still withholds exact camera locations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Legislators Demand Public Seating at the Moynihan Train Hall,' highlights the lack of benches in the busy transit hub. The letter states, 'To ensure everyone can enjoy this public good, we request the installation of additional seating.' Lawmakers Hoylman, Nadler, Jackson, Gottfried, Levine, and Bottcher signed the letter. They note that the small waiting area for ticketed passengers is not enough, forcing travelers—especially seniors—to sit on the floor or wander in search of a seat. The officials reject exclusionary design that targets unhoused people, urging services and outreach instead. Amtrak has not responded. The push for seating centers the needs of all passengers, especially the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, considered as of January 31, 2022, is under review by the state legislature. The measure, described as aiming to 'encourage public transit use, reduce car ownership, and address climate change,' would give New York City 180 days to update zoning if passed. Sen. Hoylman, the sponsor, calls parking minimums 'backwards' and a barrier to affordable housing. Sen. Alessandra Biaggi (D-Bronx) has shown support for similar efforts. The Department of City Planning and the governor's office will review the legislation if it advances. The bill does not ban parking outright, but removes the mandate, letting developers decide.
