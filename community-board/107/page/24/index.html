Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council and DOT can act now. But the limit stands. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in question. The city builds more bike lanes and redesigns intersections, but the work is slow. The NYPD cracks down on e-bike riders with criminal summonses, while drivers who kill often walk away. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected crossings. Demand that speed cameras stay on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Noise and fumes choke neighborhoods. Lawmakers cite climate justice, but federal rules block action. Complaints soar. The city’s deal fails. Residents and activists demand relief. The sky remains loud.</p><p class=mb3>On December 12, 2022, the New York City Council, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, introduced a bill to ban non-essential helicopter flights from city heliports. The bill, discussed in oversight hearings, remains stalled. The matter summary states: 'Noise complaints from helicopters over New York City have soared in recent years, but lawmakers at city, state, and federal levels have failed to significantly reduce non-essential helicopter flights.' Restler declared, 'This isn't just a quality of life issue — it's about climate justice. 1 helicopter idling is the equivalent of 40 cars!' Council Member Gale Brewer and State Senator Brad Hoylman joined calls for action. Despite advocacy and testimony from residents, significant policy changes have not passed. The Federal Aviation Administration’s authority blocks local control. Helicopter noise and pollution continue to harm New Yorkers, especially in vulnerable neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project and Council Member Gale Brewer both called for more protected bike lanes, higher expense rates, and better charging infrastructure. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives said, 'Workers have the right to a safe workplace: for our city's delivery workers, this means a network of safe, protected bike lanes that help prevent crashes.'
