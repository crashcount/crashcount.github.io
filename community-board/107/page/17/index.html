A girl rides her bike. A mother waits for the light. In Manhattan CB7, these moments end in blood too often. In the last twelve months, five people died and nine suffered serious injuries on these streets. The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, and a 74-year-old cyclist. More than 300 people were hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old, walking or riding, careful or distracted. They only count the bodies.</p><h2 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h2><p>Miriam Reinharth was crossing Amsterdam Avenue at 96th Street. She did not make it to the other side. The ambulance driver who struck her was charged with failure to yield. &ldquo;The police officer said the accident was not Miriam&rsquo;s fault at all,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>said her husband, Steven Greenhouse</a>. A 13-year-old girl was killed by an SUV on Cathedral Parkway. Her name is not in the data. Her absence is.</p><p>Darnell Sealy-McCrorey stood with other grieving families and said, &ldquo;This epidemic is preventable. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>at a rally for safer streets</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Local leaders have tools. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council and DOT can act now. But the limit stands. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in question. The city builds more bike lanes and redesigns intersections, but the work is slow. The NYPD cracks down on e-bike riders with criminal summonses, while drivers who kill often walk away. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected crossings. Demand that speed cameras stay on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Resistance remains.</p><p class=mb3>"What’s happening in West Harlem – it’s working." -- Shaun Abreu</p><p class=mb3>On October 11, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams announced support for the Sanitation Department's plan to repurpose 150,000 parking spaces for containerized garbage collection. The policy, unveiled by DSNY, aims to move trash from sidewalks into closed bins, targeting cleaner streets and less sidewalk clutter. The mayor said, 'Everyday New Yorkers are tired of the rodents, they’re tired of the trash, and this is a small price to pay on ensuring that you can have cleaner streets.' Council member Shaun Abreu, representing West Harlem, voiced strong support, citing visible improvements from the local pilot. The plan requires smaller buildings to use wheeled bins on sidewalks, while larger buildings would get shared curbside containers. The city faces pushback from some residents, but Adams insists street cleanliness is a top concern. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the move could clear sidewalks for pedestrians and reduce hazards from trash piles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal skips real fixes—wider sidewalks, protected lanes, safer work rules. It targets e-bikes, not the cars and street chaos that truly endanger walkers.</p><p class=mb3>Council Member Robert Holden introduced a bill, co-sponsored by a Council majority, to require licenses for all e-bikes. The bill, discussed in October 2023, has not specified a streamlined process for licensing. The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy. Holden’s bill, critics argue, misses the mark for pedestrian safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She pressed the Department of Transportation for urgent safety upgrades, saying, 'How many more crashes until the DOT pays attention?' Hanif noted the recent completion of a protected bike lane on Ninth Street but stressed that more action is needed. She thanked neighbors for their support and vowed to work with the DOT. So far in 2023, 3,702 cyclists have been injured and 22 killed on New York City streets.

Others worry about access.</p><p class=mb3>On September 15, 2023, New York City launched a containerized garbage collection pilot in West Harlem. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) rolled out mechanical lifts on trucks to empty curbside containers, covering ten residential blocks and fourteen schools. The pilot aims to 'eliminate sidewalk trash bags, combat rats, and reclaim public roadway space from private car storage.' Council Member Shaun Abreu and DSNY officials publicly supported the program, with Abreu stating, 'Rats are a huge problem uptown, and we’ll never get the problem under control as long as we’re just throwing bags on the sidewalk.' Jonathan Viguers, DSNY assistant commissioner, acknowledged the removal of parking spaces as necessary. The initiative is part of Mayor Adams's anti-rat campaign. While some residents praise cleaner sidewalks, others raise concerns about accessibility and overflow. The city may expand the program, but faces cost and political hurdles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer</p><p class=mb3>On September 14, 2023, the New York City Council passed a package of bills to fight lithium-ion battery fires. The main bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, creates a city-funded buy-back program for delivery workers to exchange faulty batteries and devices for safe, certified ones. The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
