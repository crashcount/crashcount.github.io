Streets could get safer. The city waits.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul announced her support for a state bill—known as Sammy’s Law—that would let New York City lower its own speed limits. The bill, sponsored by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, has stalled in the legislature before. Hochul’s State of the State address declared, 'she will introduce her own version of the existing "Sammy's Law" bill.' Hoylman-Sigal called City Council members his 'partners' and urged their support. Amy Cohen, whose son was killed by a speeding driver, pressed the Council to act, saying, 'We need the Council to make it a priority to support Sammy's Law and redesign streets ... at a safe speed limit.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone added, 'DOT strongly supports Sammy’s Law.' The Adams administration and street safety advocates back the measure. If passed, the law would let the city drop speed limits below 25 mph citywide and below 15 mph near schools, giving local officials real power to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The veto blocks a ban on non-essential flights from W. 30th Street. Noise complaints keep rising. Lawmakers and advocates slam the move. Relief for battered West Siders stalls again.</p><p class=mb3>On December 16, 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul vetoed a bill from State Sen. Brad Hoylman and Assembly Member Dick Gottfried. The bill, which passed the legislature, would have allowed New Yorkers to sue helicopter companies for 'unreasonable and sustained noise' and banned non-essential flights from the W. 30th Street heliport. Hochul argued the measure conflicted with federal law, writing, 'Certain elements of this legislation run counter to the federal scheme regulating New York's airports and airspace.' Hoylman, the bill's sponsor, pushed back, citing a surge in noise complaints and calling the effort 'worth pursuing.' Andrew Rosenthal of Stop the Chop NY/NJ criticized Hochul's deference to federal preemption.

The veto blocks a ban on non-essential flights from W. 30th Street. Noise complaints keep rising. Lawmakers and advocates slam the move. Relief for battered West Siders stalls again.</p><p class=mb3>On December 16, 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul vetoed a bill from State Sen. Brad Hoylman and Assembly Member Dick Gottfried. The bill, which passed the legislature, would have allowed New Yorkers to sue helicopter companies for 'unreasonable and sustained noise' and banned non-essential flights from the W. 30th Street heliport. Hochul argued the measure conflicted with federal law, writing, 'Certain elements of this legislation run counter to the federal scheme regulating New York's airports and airspace.' Hoylman, the bill's sponsor, pushed back, citing a surge in noise complaints and calling the effort 'worth pursuing.' Andrew Rosenthal of Stop the Chop NY/NJ criticized Hochul's deference to federal preemption.

Noise and fumes choke neighborhoods. Lawmakers cite climate justice, but federal rules block action. Complaints soar. The city’s deal fails. Residents and activists demand relief. The sky remains loud.</p><p class=mb3>"If you want to be an administration that is responsive to New Yorkers, you would end those non-essential helicopter flights. People are beside themselves." -- Gale A. Brewer</p><p class=mb3>On December 12, 2022, the New York City Council, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, introduced a bill to ban non-essential helicopter flights from city heliports. The bill, discussed in oversight hearings, remains stalled. The matter summary states: 'Noise complaints from helicopters over New York City have soared in recent years, but lawmakers at city, state, and federal levels have failed to significantly reduce non-essential helicopter flights.' Restler declared, 'This isn't just a quality of life issue — it's about climate justice. 1 helicopter idling is the equivalent of 40 cars!' Council Member Gale Brewer and State Senator Brad Hoylman joined calls for action. Despite advocacy and testimony from residents, significant policy changes have not passed. The Federal Aviation Administration’s authority blocks local control. Helicopter noise and pollution continue to harm New Yorkers, especially in vulnerable neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
