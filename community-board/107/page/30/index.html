Eleven left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, the streets of Manhattan CB7 have not spared the old or the young. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was struck and killed by an SUV. A 13-year-old girl died crossing Manhattan Avenue. A 74-year-old cyclist, helmet on, was killed at West End and 70th. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, families left with empty chairs.</p><p><strong>In the past year alone, crashes rose 17%. Deaths jumped from one to five.</strong> Serious injuries climbed. The dead are mostly pedestrians and cyclists. The killers are cars, trucks, SUVs. The city counts the bodies. The city waits.</p><h3 id=why-didnt-he-stop>&ldquo;Why Didn&rsquo;t He Stop?&rdquo;</h3><p>A woman stood on the street, horn blaring, as a driver kept coming. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he stop?

State Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Brad Hoylman-Sigal</a> voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Both voted to extend school speed zones. But the default speed limit is still not 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers still roam free. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save you unless you make it.</strong> Call your council member.

The study, first commissioned in 2018, follows a near-fatal crash between a cyclist and a jogger. The park’s roadways, once for leisure, now see daily conflict among cyclists, pedestrians, horse carriages, and pedicabs. Council Member Gale Brewer reported, 'I get complaints from people, they're no longer using Central Park, they're afraid of getting hit.' Advocates and users cite confusion, poor signage, and unclear lane markings. Suggestions include brighter lines and reducing car space citywide. The Conservancy has not released details on the study’s scope or timeline. Collisions and injuries persist. The park remains dangerous for those outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in committee, seeks to reduce or eliminate parking minimums for new developments. The matter summary states the proposal will 'prioritize people over parking, aiming to make streets safer and reduce parking requirements to enable more housing and amenities.' Restler said, 'In urban hubs like Lower Manhattan, the heart of the South Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn or Downtown Jamaica, we need affordable housing, economic development with good jobs, and dynamic mixed use buildings, not more parking.' The bill has drawn support from advocates and developers, who argue that parking mandates drive up housing costs and disrupt pedestrian-friendly streets. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remained noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and bureaucracy.

The proposal’s summary states it will 'prioritize people over parking,' aiming to make streets safer and housing more affordable. Council Member Lincoln Restler supports the move, saying, 'we need affordable housing, economic development... not more parking.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman calls parking spaces a poor use of land amid a housing crisis. Advocates like Sara Lind urge full elimination, citing pollution and congestion. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remains noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and open to review. The proposal is in early stages, with state legislation also in play.

Brewer vows investigation.</p><p class=mb3>On October 5, 2022, Council Member Gale Brewer, chair of the Council's oversight committee, announced plans to investigate the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) street safety claims. Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress. Road deaths remain high, and the city lags on legal mandates for bus and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
