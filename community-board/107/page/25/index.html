The resolution, led by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, is a required step before state passage. Brooks-Powers had withheld support until the bill included street redesigns for safety, especially in low-income communities of color. She said, 'Lowering speed limits works best when paired with traffic calming and street safety infrastructure.' The resolution now has 23 co-sponsors, three short of a majority. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver. Last year, the Council failed to pass a home rule message under Speaker Adams.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not yet a formal bill, launches with a pilot in Manhattan’s Community Board 9, supported by Council Member Shaun Abreu, who declared, “We’re going to start containerizing our trash.” The DSNY report claims containerization could work in 89% of the city but demands a major overhaul: 150,000 curbside parking spots repurposed, hundreds of millions spent on new trucks and bins. The matter summary notes, 'New York City can containerize its sidewalk garbage, but doing so will require a major overhaul of the sanitation system.' Advocates like Christine Berthet call it transformative; others, like car owners, bristle at lost parking. The plan faces political headwinds, but if realized, it could mark a historic shift for city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, starting fall 2023 in West Harlem, covers up to 10 residential blocks and 14 public schools. The DSNY report, with McKinsey input, finds containerization viable for most neighborhoods. The matter aims to 'remove garbage bags from sidewalks' and address public health.

Advocates like CHEKPEDS founder Christine Berthet support repurposing parking for trash containers, citing sidewalk access.

The deal follows a $1.3 million settlement over unnecessary work, including extra electrical poles and poor training. The contract was approved under Mayor Adams and Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, while Verra was under Department of Investigation monitorship. Manhattan Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer questioned the decision, stating, 'It is bewildering how you end up with a $1.3 million settlement... and then you get a new contract for more than $300 million.' The city comptroller’s office reviewed the settlement before approval.
