The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, a 57-year-old man, and a 74-year-old cyclist. The oldest victim was 79. The youngest was a child. No one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just this spring, a 74-year-old man was killed on his bike at West End Avenue and 70th Street.</strong> A bus and a bike. The man wore a helmet. It did not matter. Days later, a pedestrian was crushed by an SUV at Broadway and 86th. The city records the cause as &ldquo;crossing against signal.&rdquo; The body is still dead. The driver keeps driving.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost-stories-behind-the-numbers>The Human Cost: Stories Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The pain does not end with the crash. In Central Park, a 72-year-old woman was struck twice by cyclists on the sidewalk. She suffered kidney damage. The police never filed a report. &ldquo;Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/she-was-hit-twice-by-bikes-in-central-park-and-says-nypd-never-followed-up-IH4810802>she told the press</a>. The city counts the dead. It loses track of the wounded.</p><p>A DOT worker, fixing a street sign downtown, was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near miss. The agency called it &ldquo;an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said a DOT spokesperson</a>. The worker survived. The fear lingers.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Local leaders have moved. Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal backed <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/albany-lawmakers-sammys-law-allow-nyc-lower-speed-limit-20-mph/>Sammy’s Law</a>, giving the city power to lower speed limits. Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal voted to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>require speed limiters for repeat speeders</a>. Both supported extending <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">speed cameras in school zones</a>. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-change>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Change</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to drop the speed limit to 20 mph. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders.</strong> Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' in the crosswalk when a Ford SUV, making a left turn, struck her with its left front bumper. She suffered fatal injuries to her lower leg and died at the scene. The police report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors on the part of the driver. The victim’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted, but the crash was precipitated by the driver’s failure to yield and inattention.

The SUV, driven by a licensed female driver, impacted the bicyclist with its left front bumper. The bicyclist, a 14-year-old male passenger on the bike, sustained abrasions to his elbow and lower arm but was conscious and not ejected. The report identifies the SUV driver's use of headphones as a contributing factor, indicating distraction. No driver errors such as failure to yield were explicitly cited, but the distraction from listening to headphones likely impaired the driver's attention. The bicyclist was not wearing any safety equipment. The bike sustained no damage, and the driver of the bike was unlicensed. The collision highlights the dangers posed by driver distraction in urban traffic environments.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

New laws target shops selling illegal lithium-ion batteries. Enforcement ramps up. Fires drop, but uncertified batteries still threaten. Online sales remain unchecked. City pushes inspections, but incentives lag.</p><p class=mb3>On September 21, 2024, the City Council enacted Local Law 49 and Local Law 50, empowering officials to padlock businesses that repeatedly violate lithium-ion battery safety rules. The Committee on Consumer Affairs advanced the bills, with Council Member Gale Brewer introducing both. The laws allow FDNY to close retailers who breach Local Law 39 three times in three years. The official matter summary states: 'The city can now forcibly close repeat offender shops that sell illegal lithium-ion batteries and micromobility devices.' Department of Consumer and Worker Protection Commissioner Vera Mayuga called the issue urgent. Baruch Herzfeld, CEO of Pop Wheels, backed the law but urged more incentives for certified batteries and safe charging. While fires have dropped since last year, uncertified batteries still pose danger. The city has inspected over 650 shops and issued 275 violations, but online sales remain a loophole.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
