A 61-year-old male motorcycle driver, wearing a helmet, was traveling westbound when a 2024 Ford SUV, also heading west, made a U-turn. The SUV’s left front bumper struck the motorcycle’s right side doors. The motorcycle driver sustained a fractured, distorted, and dislocated injury to his knee, lower leg, and foot and was conscious at the scene. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, highlighting the SUV driver's failure to maintain proper attention during the U-turn maneuver. No contributing factors related to the motorcycle driver were noted.

Council grilled DSNY for picking low bids over safety. Victims’ lives lost in the math. Oversight weak. Dangerous firms keep rolling. Streets stay risky for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 4, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on commercial waste zone implementation and contractor selection. The hearing spotlighted the Commercial Waste Zones law, which aims to cut crashes by limiting private trash haulers in each zone. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, author of the 2019 reform, and Council Member Shaun Abreu led the charge, questioning why companies like Cogent Waste Solutions—with poor safety records—were awarded contracts. Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial. Lawmakers condemned the city for putting cost before safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council members question why a company with such a record still hauls trash in city zones. The city’s new waste program promises stricter oversight, but danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2024, the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) appointed an independent monitor for Cogent Waste Solutions, a private carting firm with a deadly safety record. The move comes before the city’s new Commercial Waste Zone program launches this fall. Council Members Shaun Abreu and Sandy Nurse raised alarms, asking, 'how the city awarded a contract to a company with a history of endangering workers to begin with.' Cogent’s trucks have killed one, injured four, and racked up hundreds of violations. Despite this, DSNY allowed Cogent to win contracts in four waste zones. DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.' The oversight hearing exposes a system that lets reckless firms operate, even as new rules loom.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It doubles fines for unauthorized moped dealers from $1,000 to $2,000 and requires registration at the point of sale. The bill is expected to pass the Assembly, where Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas co-sponsors. The matter summary states: 'Fines against unauthorized moped dealers would be doubled.' Kruger said, 'My bill makes sure we know who is selling mopeds.' González-Rojas added, 'The bill will help alleviate some of the challenges we see around mopeds.' Advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project support enforcement at the point of sale, noting many dealers are unlicensed. The bill targets vendors, not riders, aiming to protect vulnerable delivery workers and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
