Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On March 30, 2022, a survey commissioned by Selective Insurance and Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety revealed that 70 percent of licensed drivers used a mobile device while driving in the past three months. The survey, which polled 2,073 U.S. adults, found that 86 percent of those driving for work used a device, and nearly a third joined video calls while driving. The matter summary states: 'A whopping 70 percent of drivers used their cellphones while driving in the last three months, according to a new survey—a startling statistic amid a nationwide spike in traffic crashes and fatalities.' Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, called for advanced safety technologies in all new vehicles. Brenda Hall of Selective Insurance urged employers to enforce distracted driving policies. The survey highlights broad public support for stricter distracted driving enforcement, advanced vehicle safety tech, and higher penalties. No council bill or committee action is attached, but the findings fuel calls for urgent policy change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2022, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) held a public hearing on a proposed rule change to New York City's vehicle idling law. The change would broaden the definition of 'processing device,' letting more vehicles idle legally. Manhattan Community Board 4 voted unanimously to reject the change, warning, 'These exemptions... would create an argument that just about any activity that requires power in a vehicle is an idling defense.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman testified, 'Drivers most often idle in front of highly trafficked pedestrian areas... those that live near large roadways face serious health repercussions.' Advocates, residents, and Dr. Patrick Schnell all opposed the proposal, citing health and environmental harm. Spectrum requested a variance, but all testimony opposed it. The DEP claims the change clarifies the law, but enforcement is already weak and large companies are frequent violators.

They say speed promises push riders to risk lives. Brewer slams dark stores for skirting zoning. Gorillas drops its 10-minute pledge, adds store pickup. Riders and pedestrians remain in danger.</p><p class=mb3>On February 25, 2022, Council Member Gale A. Brewer (District 6) joined calls to rein in grocery delivery apps. The bill, still in early stages, aims to ban advertising of rapid delivery times. The matter summary reads: 'ban apps from advertising quick delivery times, arguing they encourage delivery workers to break traffic laws and endanger themselves and pedestrians.' Brewer also pressed for enforcement against 'dark stores' operating in retail zones. She criticized Gorillas' changes as cosmetic, saying, 'They're doing this just to conform [to zoning rules] but it's not really their model.' Councilman Christopher Marte is leading the bill. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the council’s focus is clear: speed kills, and zoning violations breed chaos.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
