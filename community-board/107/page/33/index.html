Eleven left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, the streets of Manhattan CB7 have not spared the old or the young. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was struck and killed by an SUV. A 13-year-old girl died crossing Manhattan Avenue. A 74-year-old cyclist, helmet on, was killed at West End and 70th. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, families left with empty chairs.</p><p><strong>In the past year alone, crashes rose 17%. Deaths jumped from one to five.</strong> Serious injuries climbed. The dead are mostly pedestrians and cyclists. The killers are cars, trucks, SUVs. The city counts the bodies. The city waits.</p><h3 id=why-didnt-he-stop>&ldquo;Why Didn&rsquo;t He Stop?&rdquo;</h3><p>A woman stood on the street, horn blaring, as a driver kept coming. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he stop?

State Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Brad Hoylman-Sigal</a> voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Both voted to extend school speed zones. But the default speed limit is still not 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers still roam free. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save you unless you make it.</strong> Call your council member.

The event, covered by Gothamist, highlighted the city's plan to add 20 more miles of bus lanes, part of Mayor Adams's pledge for 150 miles by 2025. Brewer declared, "Cars can't be in the bus lanes," and pushed for cameras to catch violators. Advocates like Cecilia Ellis and Jolyse Race joined, stressing that bus delays hurt low-income and older New Yorkers most. The press conference did not involve a formal bill or committee action, but spotlighted the urgent need for enforcement to protect bus riders—many of whom are vulnerable road users stranded by blocked lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers extended New York City's school-zone speed camera program for three years, allowing 24/7 operation—a win for street safety. The bill, however, was watered down. Other measures under the 'Crash Victims Rights and Safety Act' saw mixed results: some passed, like upstate towns setting 25 mph speed limits and increased complete streets funding; others, like 'Sammy's Law' for NYC speed limits and expanded safe passing for cyclists, stalled. The matter title called the session 'historic, yet deeply disappointing.' Adams was not a sponsor but was referenced in the debate. Advocates and senators voiced frustration at the lack of progress on local speed limit control and measures against repeat reckless drivers. The session left vulnerable road users without key protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers failed to pass Sammy’s Law and other vital safety bills. Advocates called the session a partial victory, but vulnerable road users remain at risk. Progress, but not enough. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>The 2022 New York State legislative session ended on June 6, 2022. Lawmakers extended and expanded New York City’s school-zone speed camera program to operate 24/7 for three more years. The bill passed, but was watered down from its original form. Other key street safety bills, including 'Sammy’s Law'—which would let NYC set its own speed limits—did not advance. Senator Andrew Gounardes called the speed camera win 'monumental,' while Senator Brad Hoylman said, 'not as much as any of us would have wanted to see, but for the first time, speed cameras are normalized.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives voiced disappointment over the failure of Sammy’s Law, calling it a top priority for Families for Safe Streets. Several other bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists stalled or died in committee. The session brought some progress, but left many dangers unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to fine drivers $50 for each infraction, targeting those who block or drive in bike lanes. The matter summary states: 'NYC pols propose traffic cameras to deter drivers from using bike lanes.' Mamdani and Hoylman argue that enforcement is critical, with Mamdani stating, 'You consistently see cars driving in the bike lane.

Brewer (District 6) joined calls to regulate app-based grocery delivery vehicles in Manhattan. The matter, described as 'Grocery delivery app Gopuff has begun using cars in addition to bicycles and scooters for deliveries in Manhattan,' highlights growing concern over congestion, double parking, and unlicensed vehicles. Councilmember Julie Menin sent a letter to Gopuff and requested legislation for industry regulation, including licensing. Brewer criticized the added congestion and pollution, stating, 'If Gopuff is using cars for deliveries, they are exacerbating congestion and pollution.' Both councilmembers demand action as residents report blocked streets and trapped cars. The push for regulation aims to protect neighborhoods and vulnerable road users from the dangers of unchecked delivery fleets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law requires weekly checks of at least 25 blocks for placard abuse and illegal parking, plus monthly reports to city officials. Brewer’s letter to Commissioner Keechant Sewell stated, "The Department has not been in compliance with this law, and I respectfully ask the Department to treat illegal parking and placard abuse with the level of urgency it deserves." Brewer dismissed NYPD’s pandemic excuses, insisting, "If it's a law, you got to follow it." She warned that placard abuse endangers road users, clogs streets, and erodes trust. The NYPD has not responded. The Department of Investigation confirmed the NYPD’s failure to meet legal requirements. Brewer’s push highlights the city’s ongoing struggle to protect streets from lawless parking and official neglect.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
