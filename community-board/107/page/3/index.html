A girl rides her bike. A mother waits for the light. In Manhattan CB7, these moments end in blood too often. In the last twelve months, five people died and nine suffered serious injuries on these streets. The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, and a 74-year-old cyclist. More than 300 people were hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old, walking or riding, careful or distracted. They only count the bodies.</p><h2 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h2><p>Miriam Reinharth was crossing Amsterdam Avenue at 96th Street. She did not make it to the other side. The ambulance driver who struck her was charged with failure to yield. &ldquo;The police officer said the accident was not Miriam&rsquo;s fault at all,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>said her husband, Steven Greenhouse</a>. A 13-year-old girl was killed by an SUV on Cathedral Parkway. Her name is not in the data. Her absence is.</p><p>Darnell Sealy-McCrorey stood with other grieving families and said, &ldquo;This epidemic is preventable. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>at a rally for safer streets</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Local leaders have tools. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council and DOT can act now. But the limit stands. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in question. The city builds more bike lanes and redesigns intersections, but the work is slow. The NYPD cracks down on e-bike riders with criminal summonses, while drivers who kill often walk away. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected crossings. Demand that speed cameras stay on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The program opened three delivery hubs at Amsterdam Avenue at 85th Street, Amsterdam at 73rd Street, and Broadway at 77th Street. According to the DOT, these hubs are part of a three-year pilot under the Curb Management Action Plan. The official matter summary states: 'The DOT unveiled three new microhubs to promote cleaner, greener, last-mile deliveries.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, applauded the initiative, saying, 'It is incredibly important to have these hubs where we can pull the trucks off the streets and get the delivery via bicycle.' The pilot aims to cut truck congestion, reduce double parking, and shift deliveries to low-emission modes. Delivery giants like Amazon and UPS will use the hubs. The city hopes to make streets safer for everyone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
