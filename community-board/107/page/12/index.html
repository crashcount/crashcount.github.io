Year to date: 5 deaths and 260 injuries. Crashes rose more than 21% over last year’s pace (city data).</p><h3 id=where-it-keeps-happening>Where it keeps happening</h3><p>Henry Hudson Parkway is the deadliest stretch in CB7: 2 people killed and 224 injured. Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue stack injury after injury. The worst hour is late afternoon: 4 p.m. alone saw 99 injuries in this period (city data).</p><p>Top contributing factors in CB7 include driver inattention/distraction, disregarding traffic control, failure to yield and unsafe speed. Private cars and SUVs cause most harm: SUVs account for 81 pedestrian injuries, including 4 deaths; sedans account for 77 pedestrian injuries (city data).</p><p>Fixes are not exotic. Make them local and fast: daylighting and leading pedestrian intervals on Broadway and Amsterdam; protected intersections and raised crosswalks near schools and senior centers; automated speed control, hardened lanes and targeted enforcement on Henry Hudson Parkway and at late-afternoon peaks.</p><h3 id=leaders-on-the-record>Leaders, on the record</h3><p>When DOT rolled out paid curb parking across 13 Upper West Side blocks overnight, the agency said, “Demand for curb space in the city is increasing, from trash collection and bike lanes to truck loading and parking” (West Side Spirit). CB7’s district manager said, “They didn’t provide a ton of notice” (West Side Spirit).</p><p>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery, the transportation commissioner said, “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection” (Gothamist). The Upper West Side needs that same urgency on Broadway and Amsterdam.</p><h3 id=whats-been-done--and-whats-missing>What’s been done — and what’s missing</h3><p>State Sen. Brad Hoylman‑Sigal voted yes in committee on S 4045, a bill to require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for repeat violators. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal co-sponsored the Assembly companion (A 2299) and backed measures to expand camera enforcement (A 7997). These moves matter. But CB7 still needs a citywide 20 mph default under Sammy’s Law and faster, physical turn‑calming on our deadly corners (policy and city data).</p><h3 id=do-not-look-away>Do not look away</h3><p>This is fixable. Push for daylighting and LPIs on Broadway and Amsterdam. Demand protected intersections and raised crossings by schools and senior centers. Insist on automated speed control and hardened lanes on Henry Hudson Parkway and targeted enforcement at the 4 p.m. peak. And press Albany and City Hall to use Sammy’s Law to set a 20 mph default citywide and to require speed limiters for habitual speeders.</p><p>Start here: /take_action/.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' in the crosswalk when a Ford SUV, making a left turn, struck her with its left front bumper. She suffered fatal injuries to her lower leg and died at the scene. The police report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors on the part of the driver. The victim’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted, but the crash was precipitated by the driver’s failure to yield and inattention. The system allowed an ordinary turn to become deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The SUV, driven by a licensed female driver, impacted the bicyclist with its left front bumper. The bicyclist, a 14-year-old male passenger on the bike, sustained abrasions to his elbow and lower arm but was conscious and not ejected. The report identifies the SUV driver's use of headphones as a contributing factor, indicating distraction. No driver errors such as failure to yield were explicitly cited, but the distraction from listening to headphones likely impaired the driver's attention. The bicyclist was not wearing any safety equipment. The bike sustained no damage, and the driver of the bike was unlicensed.
