Eleven left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, the streets of Manhattan CB7 have not spared the old or the young. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was struck and killed by an SUV. A 13-year-old girl died crossing Manhattan Avenue. A 74-year-old cyclist, helmet on, was killed at West End and 70th. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, families left with empty chairs.</p><p><strong>In the past year alone, crashes rose 17%. Deaths jumped from one to five.</strong> Serious injuries climbed. The dead are mostly pedestrians and cyclists. The killers are cars, trucks, SUVs. The city counts the bodies. The city waits.</p><h3 id=why-didnt-he-stop>&ldquo;Why Didn&rsquo;t He Stop?&rdquo;</h3><p>A woman stood on the street, horn blaring, as a driver kept coming. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he stop?

State Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Brad Hoylman-Sigal</a> voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Both voted to extend school speed zones. But the default speed limit is still not 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers still roam free. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save you unless you make it.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.

The Department of Transportation aims to allow only buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off quickly. The M34 bus, used by 28,000 daily riders, currently averages just 3 mph during rush hour. Officials cite the 2019 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24% and reduced crash injuries. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses.' The plan includes pedestrian improvements like shorter intersections and brighter crosswalks. The move follows previous controversies over similar projects but reflects a push for safer, more efficient streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer (District 6) took a public stance against the NYPD’s surge in criminal summonses for e-bike violations. In her editorial, Brewer wrote, 'Regulation, not criminal summonses, makes sense.' She condemned the 4,000% spike in summonses, highlighting the grave risks these pose to immigrant delivery workers, who face potential deportation for minor traffic infractions. Brewer argued that unsafe riding stems from unrealistic delivery deadlines set by companies like Grubhub and Uber, not from inherent recklessness. She called for regulation targeting delivery app practices and for companies to set realistic delivery times and prioritize safety. Brewer’s position: punish the companies, not the workers.

The coalition pushes for the SAFE Streets Package, including speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders and the 'Idaho stop' for cyclists. The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.' The piece highlights the urgent need for policy change to address reckless driving and systemic danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders and pedestrians caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 13, 2025, that NYPD has begun issuing criminal summonses, not just traffic tickets, to cyclists and e-bike riders for violations like running red lights or riding on sidewalks. The change means accused riders must appear in criminal court, not just pay a fine. The move follows the death of Priscilla Loke, struck by an e-bike in 2023. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives call the new policy 'a dangerous escalation.' The NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance urges lawmakers to require license plates for e-bikes and scooters. The article notes, 'Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court.' The shift highlights growing tension over enforcement and the push for stricter regulation after high-profile crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
