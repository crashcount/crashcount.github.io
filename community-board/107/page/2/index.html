A girl rides her bike. A mother waits for the light. In Manhattan CB7, these moments end in blood too often. In the last twelve months, five people died and nine suffered serious injuries on these streets. The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, and a 74-year-old cyclist. More than 300 people were hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old, walking or riding, careful or distracted. They only count the bodies.</p><h2 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h2><p>Miriam Reinharth was crossing Amsterdam Avenue at 96th Street. She did not make it to the other side. The ambulance driver who struck her was charged with failure to yield. &ldquo;The police officer said the accident was not Miriam&rsquo;s fault at all,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>said her husband, Steven Greenhouse</a>. A 13-year-old girl was killed by an SUV on Cathedral Parkway. Her name is not in the data. Her absence is.</p><p>Darnell Sealy-McCrorey stood with other grieving families and said, &ldquo;This epidemic is preventable. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>at a rally for safer streets</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Local leaders have tools. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council and DOT can act now. But the limit stands. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in question. The city builds more bike lanes and redesigns intersections, but the work is slow. The NYPD cracks down on e-bike riders with criminal summonses, while drivers who kill often walk away. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected crossings. Demand that speed cameras stay on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

Riders wait for relief.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on May 20, 2025, that New York City’s Department of Transportation proposed a dedicated busway for 34th Street between 3rd and 9th Avenues. The plan aims to boost bus speeds by 15% for tens of thousands of daily riders. Private cars and taxis could enter but must turn off at the first legal opportunity. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'After seeing tremendous success on 14th Street where buses have sped up, traffic has virtually disappeared, and far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes we are excited to propose a similar design on 34th Street.' The 14th Street busway, launched in 2019, increased bus speeds by up to 24% and reduced crashes. The 34th Street plan seeks similar safety and efficiency gains, with community input shaping the final design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She condemned the 4,000% spike in summonses, highlighting the grave risks these pose to immigrant delivery workers, who face potential deportation for minor traffic infractions. Brewer argued that unsafe riding stems from unrealistic delivery deadlines set by companies like Grubhub and Uber, not from inherent recklessness. She called for regulation targeting delivery app practices and for companies to set realistic delivery times and prioritize safety. Brewer’s position: punish the companies, not the workers.

Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclist crushed in Soho. Pedestrian killed crossing Woodhaven. Another cyclist struck by fire truck in Queens. Protected lanes grow, but streets remain perilous. City claims progress. The toll mounts. The danger persists.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on May 4, 2025, that a surge in deadly collisions has struck New York City as spring brings more cyclists and pedestrians to the streets. On May 1, a cyclist died after hitting a van's open door and being thrown under a truck at Broome and Centre Streets. On April 25, a motorcyclist struck and killed Breanna Henderson as she crossed Woodhaven Boulevard. On April 19, a fire truck responding to an emergency collided with a cyclist, who died at the scene. The article notes, 'each of which is under investigation by the NYPD.' The city’s Department of Transportation points to expanded protected bike lanes—87.5 miles added in three years—and new barriers, but the recent deaths highlight ongoing systemic risks for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
