Critics say the mayor’s plan punishes riders, not companies. Safety analysts note: 'No direct changes to infrastructure, enforcement, or policy for vulnerable road users; no clear safety impact can be determined.' The council may break up the plan and advance its own bills.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
