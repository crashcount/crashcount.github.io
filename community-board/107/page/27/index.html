The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, a 57-year-old man, and a 74-year-old cyclist. The oldest victim was 79. The youngest was a child. No one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just this spring, a 74-year-old man was killed on his bike at West End Avenue and 70th Street.</strong> A bus and a bike. The man wore a helmet. It did not matter. Days later, a pedestrian was crushed by an SUV at Broadway and 86th. The city records the cause as &ldquo;crossing against signal.&rdquo; The body is still dead. The driver keeps driving.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost-stories-behind-the-numbers>The Human Cost: Stories Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The pain does not end with the crash. In Central Park, a 72-year-old woman was struck twice by cyclists on the sidewalk. She suffered kidney damage. The police never filed a report. &ldquo;Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/she-was-hit-twice-by-bikes-in-central-park-and-says-nypd-never-followed-up-IH4810802>she told the press</a>. The city counts the dead. It loses track of the wounded.</p><p>A DOT worker, fixing a street sign downtown, was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near miss. The agency called it &ldquo;an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said a DOT spokesperson</a>. The worker survived. The fear lingers.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Local leaders have moved. Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal backed <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/albany-lawmakers-sammys-law-allow-nyc-lower-speed-limit-20-mph/>Sammy’s Law</a>, giving the city power to lower speed limits. Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal voted to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>require speed limiters for repeat speeders</a>. Both supported extending <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">speed cameras in school zones</a>. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-change>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Change</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to drop the speed limit to 20 mph. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders.</strong> Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets could get safer. The city waits.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul announced her support for a state bill—known as Sammy’s Law—that would let New York City lower its own speed limits. The bill, sponsored by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, has stalled in the legislature before. Hochul’s State of the State address declared, 'she will introduce her own version of the existing "Sammy's Law" bill.' Hoylman-Sigal called City Council members his 'partners' and urged their support. Amy Cohen, whose son was killed by a speeding driver, pressed the Council to act, saying, 'We need the Council to make it a priority to support Sammy's Law and redesign streets ... at a safe speed limit.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone added, 'DOT strongly supports Sammy’s Law.' The Adams administration and street safety advocates back the measure. If passed, the law would let the city drop speed limits below 25 mph citywide and below 15 mph near schools, giving local officials real power to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
