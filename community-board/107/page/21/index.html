The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, a 57-year-old man, and a 74-year-old cyclist. The oldest victim was 79. The youngest was a child. No one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just this spring, a 74-year-old man was killed on his bike at West End Avenue and 70th Street.</strong> A bus and a bike. The man wore a helmet. It did not matter. Days later, a pedestrian was crushed by an SUV at Broadway and 86th. The city records the cause as &ldquo;crossing against signal.&rdquo; The body is still dead. The driver keeps driving.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost-stories-behind-the-numbers>The Human Cost: Stories Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The pain does not end with the crash. In Central Park, a 72-year-old woman was struck twice by cyclists on the sidewalk. She suffered kidney damage. The police never filed a report. &ldquo;Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/she-was-hit-twice-by-bikes-in-central-park-and-says-nypd-never-followed-up-IH4810802>she told the press</a>. The city counts the dead. It loses track of the wounded.</p><p>A DOT worker, fixing a street sign downtown, was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near miss. The agency called it &ldquo;an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said a DOT spokesperson</a>. The worker survived. The fear lingers.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Local leaders have moved. Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal backed <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/albany-lawmakers-sammys-law-allow-nyc-lower-speed-limit-20-mph/>Sammy’s Law</a>, giving the city power to lower speed limits. Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal voted to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>require speed limiters for repeat speeders</a>. Both supported extending <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">speed cameras in school zones</a>. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-change>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Change</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to drop the speed limit to 20 mph. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders.</strong> Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Senator Andrew Gounardes leads, joined by Jeremy Cooney, Michael Gianaris, Kristen Gonzalez, Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Liz Krueger, Monica Martinez, and Luis R. Sepúlveda. The bill forces drivers with eleven points in eighteen months, or six speed/red light camera tickets in a year, to install speed-limiting devices. No safety analyst note yet.

They argue EVs cut smog, so drivers deserve a break. Critics warn this move keeps streets clogged. Fewer cars mean fewer crashes. The fight pits clean air against crowded roads.</p><p class=mb3>On July 31, 2023, a group of Manhattan elected officials—including Assembly Members Alex Bores, Eddie Gibbs, Deborah Glick, Harvey Epstein, Rebecca Seawright; State Senators Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Liz Krueger, Kristen Gonzalez; and Borough President Mark Levine—sent a letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. They urged a congestion pricing discount for electric vehicles, claiming EVs 'do not contribute significantly to the smog and pollution of the Central Business District.' Assembly Member Bores led the effort, stating, 'when it comes to the environmental case, an electric vehicle is just a different profile than a gas-guzzling one.' The officials oppose credits for bridge and tunnel crossings. Congestion pricing advocates and environmental groups counter that EV discounts undermine the core goal: fewer cars, less traffic, safer streets. They note other cities are ending such breaks. The proposal highlights a tension—cleaner air versus safer, less crowded roads for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The protest spotlighted the fight over who pays for safer, less crowded streets.</p><p class=mb3>On July 18, 2023, taxi drivers with the New York Taxi Workers Alliance protested outside MTA headquarters. The demonstration targeted the Manhattan congestion pricing plan, which aims to raise $15 billion for the MTA and cut traffic. Drivers argued they already pay hefty surcharges and cannot survive another fee. Council Member Gale A. Brewer (District 6) supported the cabbies, both in a letter to MTA chairman Janno Lieber and at the rally. Brewer said, 'I support the concept, but my main topic was not to charge yellow cabs, period. Not even once.' The protest called for a full exemption for yellow and green cab drivers. The MTA has proposed tolls from $9 to $23, but drivers say even a once-a-day charge would threaten their survival. The event underscored the tension between funding transit and protecting workers who keep the city moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The numbers demand it.</p><p class=mb3>""Hoylman-Sigal did say that banning privately owned e-bikes was 'going too far,' the paper reported, but he also did not focus the safety concerns on drivers and on the city's failure to widen sidewalks, create new micromobility lanes or daylight intersections."" -- Brad Hoylman-Sigal</p><p class=mb3>On June 30, 2023, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced a sweeping policy shift: the new 'Street Code.' The plan, described as giving 'absolute priority for pedestrians,' will remove 70,000 parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, widen sidewalks, and expand bike lanes. Hidalgo rejects harsh measures against e-bikes, focusing instead on reducing car dominance and discouraging SUVs through progressive parking fees. Council Member Gale A. Brewer, District 6, is mentioned in the context of New York’s contrasting approach, where enforcement often targets e-bikes rather than cars. Advocates highlight that cars and trucks cause most pedestrian injuries and deaths. They urge New York to emulate Paris—reclaiming street space from cars, not blaming micromobility. The data is clear: fewer cars mean safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2023, Council Member Lynn Schulman (District 29) published an editorial urging a public referendum to ban horse-drawn carriages in New York City. The editorial, titled "With politicians fearful of the TWU, a public referendum is the answer," criticizes the City Council’s failure to act on a bill that would replace horses with electric carriages. Schulman highlights that only 18 of 51 council members sponsor the bill, despite strong public support and past campaign promises. She names Justin Brennan, Gale Brewer, Julie Menin, and herself among those who have not advanced the legislation. Schulman blames union influence for the council’s inaction, citing 115 accidents and 27 horse deaths over decades. She calls for a citizen ballot initiative to bypass political gridlock and protect both horses and the public from ongoing street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
