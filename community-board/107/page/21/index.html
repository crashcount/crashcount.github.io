A girl rides her bike. A mother waits for the light. In Manhattan CB7, these moments end in blood too often. In the last twelve months, five people died and nine suffered serious injuries on these streets. The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, and a 74-year-old cyclist. More than 300 people were hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old, walking or riding, careful or distracted. They only count the bodies.</p><h2 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h2><p>Miriam Reinharth was crossing Amsterdam Avenue at 96th Street. She did not make it to the other side. The ambulance driver who struck her was charged with failure to yield. &ldquo;The police officer said the accident was not Miriam&rsquo;s fault at all,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>said her husband, Steven Greenhouse</a>. A 13-year-old girl was killed by an SUV on Cathedral Parkway. Her name is not in the data. Her absence is.</p><p>Darnell Sealy-McCrorey stood with other grieving families and said, &ldquo;This epidemic is preventable. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>at a rally for safer streets</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Local leaders have tools. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council and DOT can act now. But the limit stands. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in question. The city builds more bike lanes and redesigns intersections, but the work is slow. The NYPD cracks down on e-bike riders with criminal summonses, while drivers who kill often walk away. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected crossings. Demand that speed cameras stay on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, not yet a formal bill, launches with a pilot in Manhattan’s Community Board 9, supported by Council Member Shaun Abreu, who declared, “We’re going to start containerizing our trash.” The DSNY report claims containerization could work in 89% of the city but demands a major overhaul: 150,000 curbside parking spots repurposed, hundreds of millions spent on new trucks and bins. The matter summary notes, 'New York City can containerize its sidewalk garbage, but doing so will require a major overhaul of the sanitation system.' Advocates like Christine Berthet call it transformative; others, like car owners, bristle at lost parking. The plan faces political headwinds, but if realized, it could mark a historic shift for city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, starting fall 2023 in West Harlem, covers up to 10 residential blocks and 14 public schools. The DSNY report, with McKinsey input, finds containerization viable for most neighborhoods. The matter aims to 'remove garbage bags from sidewalks' and address public health. Council member Shaun Abreu supports the initiative, calling current practices 'backwards' and endorsing large-scale containerization. Advocates like CHEKPEDS founder Christine Berthet support repurposing parking for trash containers, citing sidewalk access. The city will double trash collection in the pilot area, with $5.7 million allocated. The plan faces challenges in dense areas, but signals a shift toward safer, cleaner streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It was introduced April 11, 2023, and pushed by Council Member Shahana K. Hanif as primary sponsor, with Jennifer Gutiérrez and over twenty others co-sponsoring. The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights.
