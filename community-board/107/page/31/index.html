Year to date: 5 deaths and 260 injuries. Crashes rose more than 21% over last year’s pace (city data).</p><h3 id=where-it-keeps-happening>Where it keeps happening</h3><p>Henry Hudson Parkway is the deadliest stretch in CB7: 2 people killed and 224 injured. Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue stack injury after injury. The worst hour is late afternoon: 4 p.m. alone saw 99 injuries in this period (city data).</p><p>Top contributing factors in CB7 include driver inattention/distraction, disregarding traffic control, failure to yield and unsafe speed. Private cars and SUVs cause most harm: SUVs account for 81 pedestrian injuries, including 4 deaths; sedans account for 77 pedestrian injuries (city data).</p><p>Fixes are not exotic. Make them local and fast: daylighting and leading pedestrian intervals on Broadway and Amsterdam; protected intersections and raised crosswalks near schools and senior centers; automated speed control, hardened lanes and targeted enforcement on Henry Hudson Parkway and at late-afternoon peaks.</p><h3 id=leaders-on-the-record>Leaders, on the record</h3><p>When DOT rolled out paid curb parking across 13 Upper West Side blocks overnight, the agency said, “Demand for curb space in the city is increasing, from trash collection and bike lanes to truck loading and parking” (West Side Spirit). CB7’s district manager said, “They didn’t provide a ton of notice” (West Side Spirit).</p><p>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery, the transportation commissioner said, “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection” (Gothamist). The Upper West Side needs that same urgency on Broadway and Amsterdam.</p><h3 id=whats-been-done--and-whats-missing>What’s been done — and what’s missing</h3><p>State Sen. Brad Hoylman‑Sigal voted yes in committee on S 4045, a bill to require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for repeat violators. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal co-sponsored the Assembly companion (A 2299) and backed measures to expand camera enforcement (A 7997). These moves matter. But CB7 still needs a citywide 20 mph default under Sammy’s Law and faster, physical turn‑calming on our deadly corners (policy and city data).</p><h3 id=do-not-look-away>Do not look away</h3><p>This is fixable. Push for daylighting and LPIs on Broadway and Amsterdam. Demand protected intersections and raised crossings by schools and senior centers. Insist on automated speed control and hardened lanes on Henry Hudson Parkway and targeted enforcement at the 4 p.m. peak. And press Albany and City Hall to use Sammy’s Law to set a 20 mph default citywide and to require speed limiters for habitual speeders.</p><p>Start here: /take_action/.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, discussed in committee, seeks to reduce or eliminate parking minimums for new developments. The matter summary states the proposal will 'prioritize people over parking, aiming to make streets safer and reduce parking requirements to enable more housing and amenities.' Restler said, 'In urban hubs like Lower Manhattan, the heart of the South Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn or Downtown Jamaica, we need affordable housing, economic development with good jobs, and dynamic mixed use buildings, not more parking.' The bill has drawn support from advocates and developers, who argue that parking mandates drive up housing costs and disrupt pedestrian-friendly streets. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remained noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and bureaucracy.

The measure, now under council review, seeks to eliminate or reduce parking minimums citywide. The proposal’s summary states it will 'prioritize people over parking,' aiming to make streets safer and housing more affordable. Council Member Lincoln Restler supports the move, saying, 'we need affordable housing, economic development... not more parking.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman calls parking spaces a poor use of land amid a housing crisis. Advocates like Sara Lind urge full elimination, citing pollution and congestion. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remains noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and open to review. The proposal is in early stages, with state legislation also in play. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users has been published.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She questions claims of 750 redesigned intersections. Public data shows far less. Most fixes are signal timing, not real protection. Advocates want proof, not promises. Road deaths remain high. Brewer vows investigation.</p><p class=mb3>On October 5, 2022, Council Member Gale Brewer, chair of the Council's oversight committee, announced plans to investigate the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) street safety claims. Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements.

The move follows a cyclist’s death on E. 85th. Advocates demanded action. The board, once resistant, now shifts toward safety for riders.</p><p class=mb3>"Andrew Rosenthal said that Mott 'was killed because of the inaction of this community board.'" -- Linda Rosenthal</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 8 (CB8) voted 38-3 to request 'fully protected crosstown bike lanes approximately every 10 blocks between 60th and 110th streets on both sides of Central Park, and a two-way protected bikeway around Central Park.' The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition. Now, the board calls for comprehensive, protected infrastructure to shield vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No comment yet.</p><p class=mb3>On September 16, 2022, Council Member Alexa Avilés challenged NYCHA’s proposed blanket ban on e-bikes across public housing. In a letter to NYCHA CEO Greg Russ, Avilés urged targeted battery safety rules instead of a broad ban, warning, 'NYCHA's all-out ban could hurt workers and residents more.' She offered eight recommendations, including federal study, safe battery storage, and clear rules for mobility devices. Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz announced plans for legislation requiring certified batteries, while Manhattan’s Gale Brewer is drafting a ban on second-hand batteries and pushing for delivery app accountability. The matter is under review after the comment period closed September 6. NYCHA declined to comment. Avilés’s stance centers on protecting delivery workers and vulnerable residents while addressing real fire risks from faulty batteries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter title calls for 'mandating the use of hi-lo, "two-tone" sirens by emergency response vehicles.' Brewer wrote, 'the city should mandate that emergency responders use hi-lo as their default siren and cap sirens at 90 decibels—as required by the proposed legislation—and scale up their use of vibrating siren technology.' The bill seeks to cut the health harms of constant siren noise, which studies link to hypertension and heart disease.

The bill would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024. It also directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to set visibility rules for vehicles over 3,000 pounds, like SUVs and pickups, to ensure drivers can see pedestrians and cyclists. The bill summary states: 'A new bill in the New York State Senate would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024.' Senator Hoylman sponsored the bill, citing the 'failure of the promise of Vision Zero.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives praised the measure, calling it 'common-sense.' The bill comes as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high. If passed, it would force automakers to include safety tech and could make some monster trucks illegal on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, discussed by the City Council and local officials, found no evidence that neighborhoods north of Manhattan’s 60th Street would be swamped by drivers seeking free parking. The MTA wrote, 'any increase in parking-seeking traffic would be short-lived.' Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, who had pushed for residential permits, said, 'I am pleasantly surprised.' Council Member Gale Brewer, who commissioned a parking study, remains cautious and plans to consult with the community. The matter’s summary states, 'reduced travel demand inside the CBD could lead to a parking surplus just south of 60th Street.' Studies from London and Stockholm back the findings. The analysis points to less driving, less danger for vulnerable road users, and a shift toward transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, not yet numbered, is in early stages. Brewer’s proposal would ban second-hand or refurbished batteries, boost Fire Department outreach, and require delivery apps like Uber and DoorDash to pay for safer batteries. The matter summary warns that a blanket ban 'would worsen the city’s homelessness crisis by forcing residents to choose between a roof over their head and a job, and still not solve the problem of lithium-ion batteries catching fire.' Council Member Alexa Avilés called for a citywide approach. Tenant leader Cynthia Tibbs and Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project also oppose the ban, urging secure charging hubs. Senator Chuck Schumer highlighted federal funding for safer infrastructure. The public can comment on the NYCHA policy until September 6. Advocates argue that bans punish workers and tenants without fixing systemic battery dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
