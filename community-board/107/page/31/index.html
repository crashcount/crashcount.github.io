Eleven left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, the streets of Manhattan CB7 have not spared the old or the young. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was struck and killed by an SUV. A 13-year-old girl died crossing Manhattan Avenue. A 74-year-old cyclist, helmet on, was killed at West End and 70th. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, families left with empty chairs.</p><p><strong>In the past year alone, crashes rose 17%. Deaths jumped from one to five.</strong> Serious injuries climbed. The dead are mostly pedestrians and cyclists. The killers are cars, trucks, SUVs. The city counts the bodies. The city waits.</p><h3 id=why-didnt-he-stop>&ldquo;Why Didn&rsquo;t He Stop?&rdquo;</h3><p>A woman stood on the street, horn blaring, as a driver kept coming. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he stop?

State Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Brad Hoylman-Sigal</a> voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Both voted to extend school speed zones. But the default speed limit is still not 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers still roam free. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save you unless you make it.</strong> Call your council member.

The aim: less noise, fewer health harms. Sirens will still clear streets, but without the shriek. The city’s nights could finally quiet down.</p><p class=mb3>On September 13, 2022, Council Member Carlina Rivera, joined by Gale Brewer and seven others, sponsored a bill to mandate hi-lo, 'two-tone' sirens for emergency vehicles. The bill, discussed in committee, would cap siren volume at 90 decibels and encourage use of vibrating, low-frequency siren technology. The matter title calls for 'mandating the use of hi-lo, "two-tone" sirens by emergency response vehicles.' Brewer wrote, 'the city should mandate that emergency responders use hi-lo as their default siren and cap sirens at 90 decibels—as required by the proposed legislation—and scale up their use of vibrating siren technology.' The bill seeks to cut the health harms of constant siren noise, which studies link to hypertension and heart disease. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was noted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024. It also directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to set visibility rules for vehicles over 3,000 pounds, like SUVs and pickups, to ensure drivers can see pedestrians and cyclists. The bill summary states: 'A new bill in the New York State Senate would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024.' Senator Hoylman sponsored the bill, citing the 'failure of the promise of Vision Zero.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives praised the measure, calling it 'common-sense.' The bill comes as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high. If passed, it would force automakers to include safety tech and could make some monster trucks illegal on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, discussed by the City Council and local officials, found no evidence that neighborhoods north of Manhattan’s 60th Street would be swamped by drivers seeking free parking. The MTA wrote, 'any increase in parking-seeking traffic would be short-lived.' Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, who had pushed for residential permits, said, 'I am pleasantly surprised.' Council Member Gale Brewer, who commissioned a parking study, remains cautious and plans to consult with the community. The matter’s summary states, 'reduced travel demand inside the CBD could lead to a parking surplus just south of 60th Street.' Studies from London and Stockholm back the findings. The analysis points to less driving, less danger for vulnerable road users, and a shift toward transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, not yet numbered, is in early stages. Brewer’s proposal would ban second-hand or refurbished batteries, boost Fire Department outreach, and require delivery apps like Uber and DoorDash to pay for safer batteries. The matter summary warns that a blanket ban 'would worsen the city’s homelessness crisis by forcing residents to choose between a roof over their head and a job, and still not solve the problem of lithium-ion batteries catching fire.' Council Member Alexa Avilés called for a citywide approach. Tenant leader Cynthia Tibbs and Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project also oppose the ban, urging secure charging hubs. Senator Chuck Schumer highlighted federal funding for safer infrastructure. The public can comment on the NYCHA policy until September 6. Advocates argue that bans punish workers and tenants without fixing systemic battery dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
