Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council and DOT can act now. But the limit stands. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in question. The city builds more bike lanes and redesigns intersections, but the work is slow. The NYPD cracks down on e-bike riders with criminal summonses, while drivers who kill often walk away. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected crossings. Demand that speed cameras stay on.

The law requires weekly checks of at least 25 blocks for placard abuse and illegal parking, plus monthly reports to city officials. Brewer’s letter to Commissioner Keechant Sewell stated, "The Department has not been in compliance with this law, and I respectfully ask the Department to treat illegal parking and placard abuse with the level of urgency it deserves." Brewer dismissed NYPD’s pandemic excuses, insisting, "If it's a law, you got to follow it." She warned that placard abuse endangers road users, clogs streets, and erodes trust. The NYPD has not responded. The Department of Investigation confirmed the NYPD’s failure to meet legal requirements.

The bill, sponsored by Kalman Yeger (primary), with Inna Vernikov, Joseph C. Borelli, Kevin C. Riley, Shaun Abreu, and Robert F. Holden as co-sponsors, was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The bill summary states: 'This bill would change the community board notification process for major transportation projects by defining the construction or removal of a bus lane, busway, or bike lane as a major transportation project, regardless of the number of consecutive blocks or consecutive feet of street that the project alters.' DOT would be required to notify and present plans to community boards, consider feedback, and post quarterly progress reports online. The bill aimed to increase transparency and community input on street changes that affect vulnerable road users, but did not become law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring curb extensions at certain dangerous intersections,' was sponsored by Council Members Hanif (primary), Menin, Hudson, Stevens, Ayala, Abreu, Krishnan, Nurse, and Riley. The bill required the Department of Transportation to identify intersections with high pedestrian crash rates and install curb extensions—prohibiting parking within 15 feet of crosswalks—at a minimum of five such intersections in each borough per year. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Curb extensions are designed to increase pedestrian visibility and reduce deadly conflicts at crossings, directly targeting systemic dangers faced by people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
