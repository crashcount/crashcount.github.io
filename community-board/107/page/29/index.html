Eleven left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, the streets of Manhattan CB7 have not spared the old or the young. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was struck and killed by an SUV. A 13-year-old girl died crossing Manhattan Avenue. A 74-year-old cyclist, helmet on, was killed at West End and 70th. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, families left with empty chairs.</p><p><strong>In the past year alone, crashes rose 17%. Deaths jumped from one to five.</strong> Serious injuries climbed. The dead are mostly pedestrians and cyclists. The killers are cars, trucks, SUVs. The city counts the bodies. The city waits.</p><h3 id=why-didnt-he-stop>&ldquo;Why Didn&rsquo;t He Stop?&rdquo;</h3><p>A woman stood on the street, horn blaring, as a driver kept coming. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he stop?

State Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Brad Hoylman-Sigal</a> voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Both voted to extend school speed zones. But the default speed limit is still not 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers still roam free. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save you unless you make it.</strong> Call your council member.

The fight for safety continues.</p><p class=mb3>On November 23, 2022, a new city report recommended a significant pay raise for New York’s 65,000 app-based delivery workers. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection projects a 35% jump in deliveries by 2025, raising safety concerns. The report summary states, 'the number of deliveries made per hour will increase, leading to more delivery workers on city streets.' Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project and Council Member Gale Brewer both called for more protected bike lanes, higher expense rates, and better charging infrastructure. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives said, 'Workers have the right to a safe workplace: for our city's delivery workers, this means a network of safe, protected bike lanes that help prevent crashes.' Advocates insist a wage hike alone is not enough. They demand the city build out infrastructure to protect workers from traffic violence and hazardous conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'More Money for Delivery Workers Will Require More Protection for Them,' highlights a proposed minimum wage of $23.82 per hour for app-based delivery workers, up from $7.09. Council Member Gale A. Brewer (District 6) voiced support for a $5 increase to cover work expenses, stating, 'I support increasing the expense rate in the rule by $5 to address these work tools.' The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection projects a 35% jump in deliveries by 2025. Advocates and workers say higher pay must come with more protected bike lanes and charging stations. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives said, 'Workers have the right to a safe workplace: for our city's delivery workers, this means a network of safe, protected bike lanes.'
