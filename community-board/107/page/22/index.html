A girl rides her bike. A mother waits for the light. In Manhattan CB7, these moments end in blood too often. In the last twelve months, five people died and nine suffered serious injuries on these streets. The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, and a 74-year-old cyclist. More than 300 people were hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old, walking or riding, careful or distracted. They only count the bodies.</p><h2 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h2><p>Miriam Reinharth was crossing Amsterdam Avenue at 96th Street. She did not make it to the other side. The ambulance driver who struck her was charged with failure to yield. &ldquo;The police officer said the accident was not Miriam&rsquo;s fault at all,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>said her husband, Steven Greenhouse</a>. A 13-year-old girl was killed by an SUV on Cathedral Parkway. Her name is not in the data. Her absence is.</p><p>Darnell Sealy-McCrorey stood with other grieving families and said, &ldquo;This epidemic is preventable. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>at a rally for safer streets</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Local leaders have tools. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council and DOT can act now. But the limit stands. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in question. The city builds more bike lanes and redesigns intersections, but the work is slow. The NYPD cracks down on e-bike riders with criminal summonses, while drivers who kill often walk away. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected crossings. Demand that speed cameras stay on. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The deal follows a $1.3 million settlement over unnecessary work, including extra electrical poles and poor training. The contract was approved under Mayor Adams and Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, while Verra was under Department of Investigation monitorship. Manhattan Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer questioned the decision, stating, 'It is bewildering how you end up with a $1.3 million settlement... and then you get a new contract for more than $300 million.' The city comptroller’s office reviewed the settlement before approval.

Over $1 billion owed. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams slams budget cuts. She demands the city collect what drivers owe. Unpaid tickets mean reckless drivers dodge consequences. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On April 5, 2023, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (District 28) responded to a report showing New York City is owed more than $1 billion in unpaid parking and speeding fines. The Independent Budget Office found $1.02 billion in unpaid traffic fines from 2017 to 2022, including camera tickets for speeding and red lights. The matter, titled 'Ticket to slide: NYC owed more than $1 billion in unpaid parking, speeding fines, report finds,' highlights growing debt as enforcement lags. Adams, along with Comptroller Brad Lander, criticized further city agency budget cuts, urging the city to collect owed fines instead. The report notes that while 24/7 school-zone speed cameras have reduced speeding, the city has failed to stop drivers from evading cameras with defaced or fake plates—letting dangerous drivers escape accountability. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer stated, 'We don’t do a good job of collecting this money. We have to do a better job.' The Independent Budget Office found over $1 billion in uncollected parking and red light camera fines, with the backlog rising as the city increases automated enforcement.

Councilmember Stevens called it a major problem. Advocates and public blasted the excuse. The mayor’s promises ring hollow as placard abuse and blocked sidewalks persist.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2023, the City Council held a hearing on NYPD illegal parking practices. The session focused on the widespread use of sidewalks for police parking. Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey defended the practice, saying, 'There’s not enough parking spots.' Councilmember Althea Stevens, representing District 16, highlighted the issue’s impact on her district: 'It becomes very difficult. And not just for me, but even to drive down.' Councilmember Gale Brewer also pressed the NYPD, calling for fewer police and private cars parked illegally. Transit advocates and the public questioned why officers do not use public transit. The Adams administration claims it will crack down on illegal parking, but past actions suggest otherwise. The hearing exposed the city’s failure to protect sidewalks for pedestrians, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'Legislators in Albany have proposed a budget to fill the MTA's fiscal hole, avert a fare hike, and fund a small pilot of free buses across New York City.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Andrew Gounardes pledged to keep fighting for better frequency. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber praised stable funding. Advocates like Betsy Plum criticized the omission: 'The legislature's budget ignores millions of riders stranded 12, 15, 20 minutes or more on subway platforms and at bus stops.'

Delivery workers’ safety and livelihoods hung in the balance. Lawmakers targeted sellers, not riders. The bills aimed to stop deadly fires without punishing those who rely on e-bikes to survive.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, the New York City Council advanced a package of lithium-ion battery safety bills. Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
