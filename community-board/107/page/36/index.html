Vulnerable riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On June 16, 2022, Council Member Gale A. Brewer of District 6 led a press conference urging stronger enforcement of bus lanes. The event, covered by Gothamist, highlighted the city's plan to add 20 more miles of bus lanes, part of Mayor Adams's pledge for 150 miles by 2025. Brewer declared, "Cars can't be in the bus lanes," and pushed for cameras to catch violators. Advocates like Cecilia Ellis and Jolyse Race joined, stressing that bus delays hurt low-income and older New Yorkers most. The press conference did not involve a formal bill or committee action, but spotlighted the urgent need for enforcement to protect bus riders—many of whom are vulnerable road users stranded by blocked lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
