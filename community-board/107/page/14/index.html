Eleven left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, the streets of Manhattan CB7 have not spared the old or the young. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was struck and killed by an SUV. A 13-year-old girl died crossing Manhattan Avenue. A 74-year-old cyclist, helmet on, was killed at West End and 70th. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, families left with empty chairs.</p><p><strong>In the past year alone, crashes rose 17%. Deaths jumped from one to five.</strong> Serious injuries climbed. The dead are mostly pedestrians and cyclists. The killers are cars, trucks, SUVs. The city counts the bodies. The city waits.</p><h3 id=why-didnt-he-stop>&ldquo;Why Didn&rsquo;t He Stop?&rdquo;</h3><p>A woman stood on the street, horn blaring, as a driver kept coming. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he stop?

State Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Brad Hoylman-Sigal</a> voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Both voted to extend school speed zones. But the default speed limit is still not 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers still roam free. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save you unless you make it.</strong> Call your council member.

The project, a $300 million overhaul, is part of ongoing MTA accessibility efforts. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents District 47, praised the work: "There is a fundamental right to access mass transit. And today we are taking an important step forward in making that right real to all New Yorkers." The upgrades will make the complex fully accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Still, 23 other stations remain on hold after congestion pricing was paused, freezing $15 billion in planned improvements. Only 30% of stations are accessible.

Brad Hoylman-Sigal (District 47) joined the debate over New York’s congestion pricing plan. The original $15 toll was paused by Governor Hochul in June. Now, officials consider a lower toll or alternatives to fund the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'we need congestion pricing.' The matter, titled 'MTA boss ‘thrilled’ Kathy Hochul eyeing lower congestion toll after NY gov indefinitely paused controversial scheme,' highlights the urgency of MTA financing. Assemblywoman Deborah Glick noted Hochul’s commitment to a replacement plan. The bill’s status remains in flux, with no committee or vote recorded. The safety impact for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—was not assessed. The city’s most at-risk remain exposed as leaders argue over dollars and cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pedestrians and residents gain cleaner, safer space.</p><p class=mb3>On August 8, 2024, Councilmember Shaun Abreu, chair of the City Council's sanitation committee, announced the expansion of a sanitation pilot in District 7. The Department of Sanitation will install up to 1,500 large, Madrid-made bins in West Harlem parking spaces, targeting buildings with more than 31 units. The pilot, launched last year, replaces sidewalk trash bags with secure, stationary bins. Abreu said, 'I couldn’t be more thrilled that Barcelona is making its way to New York City – but unfortunately for the rats, that means no tapas for them.' The bins, emptied by new trucks, have already reduced rat complaints and cleaned up streets. Some residents worry about lost parking, but others, like Esther Yoon, praise the cleaner, safer sidewalks. The city will spend up to $700,000 annually on the program, aiming to expand across all boroughs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council delays action as streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On July 19, 2024, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams addressed the Council’s authority under Sammy’s Law, which lets New York City lower its speed limit. The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority. The Council’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets see more mopeds, more injuries, more tension.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2024, Governor Hochul signed a package of eight bills into law, including new moped and e-bike safety regulations. The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.
