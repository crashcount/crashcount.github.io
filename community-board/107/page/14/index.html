No clear resolution.</p><p class=mb3>On September 5, 2024, Council Member Shaun Abreu of District 7 joined Upper West Side residents in questioning the Department of Transportation's plan for a 24/7 offset bus lane on 96th Street. The DOT proposal, intended to speed up the M96 bus for 15,000 daily riders, would repurpose a travel lane in each direction while preserving curb parking. Abreu stated, "I wouldn’t say I’m opposed or in favor at this point," but called for more clarity and adjustments from DOT. The matter, described as a push to 'torpedo planned bus lane on 96th Street,' has drawn support from East Side's Community Board 8 and opposition from West Side locals and Council Member Gale Brewer, who suggested alternatives like bus signal priority. The debate centers on balancing transit improvements with residential curb access. No formal committee action or safety analysis has been reported.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, a $300 million overhaul, is part of ongoing MTA accessibility efforts. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents District 47, praised the work: "There is a fundamental right to access mass transit. And today we are taking an important step forward in making that right real to all New Yorkers." The upgrades will make the complex fully accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Still, 23 other stations remain on hold after congestion pricing was paused, freezing $15 billion in planned improvements. Only 30% of stations are accessible.

The matter, titled 'MTA boss ‘thrilled’ Kathy Hochul eyeing lower congestion toll after NY gov indefinitely paused controversial scheme,' highlights the urgency of MTA financing. Assemblywoman Deborah Glick noted Hochul’s commitment to a replacement plan. The bill’s status remains in flux, with no committee or vote recorded. The safety impact for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—was not assessed.

The law orders the Department of Transportation to post current bicycle and micromobility ridership data online, updated monthly or at least yearly. The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Restler, Hudson, Schulman, and others. The law demands transparency on where riders travel and what DOT does to keep them safe. This opens the books on bike movement and exposes gaps in protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pedestrians and residents gain cleaner, safer space.</p><p class=mb3>On August 8, 2024, Councilmember Shaun Abreu, chair of the City Council's sanitation committee, announced the expansion of a sanitation pilot in District 7. The Department of Sanitation will install up to 1,500 large, Madrid-made bins in West Harlem parking spaces, targeting buildings with more than 31 units. The pilot, launched last year, replaces sidewalk trash bags with secure, stationary bins. Abreu said, 'I couldn’t be more thrilled that Barcelona is making its way to New York City – but unfortunately for the rats, that means no tapas for them.' The bins, emptied by new trucks, have already reduced rat complaints and cleaned up streets. Some residents worry about lost parking, but others, like Esther Yoon, praise the cleaner, safer sidewalks. The city will spend up to $700,000 annually on the program, aiming to expand across all boroughs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She calls for district input. Advocates warn: patchwork rules endanger lives. Uniform 20 mph limit saves people. Council delays action as streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On July 19, 2024, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams addressed the Council’s authority under Sammy’s Law, which lets New York City lower its speed limit. The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority. The Council’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers say this closes loopholes, shifts blame from workers, and aims to cut rising crashes. Streets see more mopeds, more injuries, more tension.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2024, Governor Hochul signed a package of eight bills into law, including new moped and e-bike safety regulations. The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.
