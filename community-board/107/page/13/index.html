The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, a 57-year-old man, and a 74-year-old cyclist. The oldest victim was 79. The youngest was a child. No one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just this spring, a 74-year-old man was killed on his bike at West End Avenue and 70th Street.</strong> A bus and a bike. The man wore a helmet. It did not matter. Days later, a pedestrian was crushed by an SUV at Broadway and 86th. The city records the cause as &ldquo;crossing against signal.&rdquo; The body is still dead. The driver keeps driving.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost-stories-behind-the-numbers>The Human Cost: Stories Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The pain does not end with the crash. In Central Park, a 72-year-old woman was struck twice by cyclists on the sidewalk. She suffered kidney damage. The police never filed a report. &ldquo;Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/she-was-hit-twice-by-bikes-in-central-park-and-says-nypd-never-followed-up-IH4810802>she told the press</a>. The city counts the dead. It loses track of the wounded.</p><p>A DOT worker, fixing a street sign downtown, was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near miss. The agency called it &ldquo;an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said a DOT spokesperson</a>. The worker survived. The fear lingers.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Local leaders have moved. Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal backed <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/albany-lawmakers-sammys-law-allow-nyc-lower-speed-limit-20-mph/>Sammy’s Law</a>, giving the city power to lower speed limits. Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal voted to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>require speed limiters for repeat speeders</a>. Both supported extending <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">speed cameras in school zones</a>. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-change>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Change</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to drop the speed limit to 20 mph. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders.</strong> Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, described as a 'City Council member public statement/rally regarding bus lane project,' saw Brewer call on DOT to remove two blocks from the crosstown bus lane plan, citing the area's 'residential character' and questioning the need due to 'current bus speeds.' Brewer, who once backed bus lanes on 14th, 34th, and 181st Streets, now argued for alternatives and said, 'I'm a bus rider who takes this bus every day. It's not slow.' DOT countered that parking would be preserved and loading zones added. Transit advocates criticized Brewer for ignoring data on slow westbound buses and the needs of 15,000 daily riders. Council Member Shaun Abreu, who represents the district, did not attend and stated he does not oppose the bus lane.

Brewer (District 6) joined Upper West Side residents to oppose the Department of Transportation’s plan for dedicated bus lanes on 96th Street. The proposal, announced in May, would convert a traffic lane in each direction to bus-only use between First and West End avenues, aiming to speed up the M96 and M106 routes. Brewer, who previously supported bus lanes elsewhere, told the crowd, 'There are concerns that we have. I think that you have to look at alternatives to making the bus go faster.' The matter, titled by Gothamist as 'Yet another NYC bus lane plan faces big fight, this time from angry Upper West Siders,' highlights tension between transit improvements and local access.

The matter, described as a push to 'torpedo planned bus lane on 96th Street,' has drawn support from East Side's Community Board 8 and opposition from West Side locals and Council Member Gale Brewer, who suggested alternatives like bus signal priority.

Riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On August 22, 2024, construction finished on three new elevators at the 14th Street subway complex, serving the F, M, and L lines, with connections to the 1, 2, and 3. The project, a $300 million overhaul, is part of ongoing MTA accessibility efforts. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents District 47, praised the work: "There is a fundamental right to access mass transit. And today we are taking an important step forward in making that right real to all New Yorkers." The upgrades will make the complex fully accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Still, 23 other stations remain on hold after congestion pricing was paused, freezing $15 billion in planned improvements. Only 30% of stations are accessible. The future for vulnerable riders is uncertain without new funding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users wait for action. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On August 22, 2024, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (District 47) joined the debate over New York’s congestion pricing plan. The original $15 toll was paused by Governor Hochul in June. Now, officials consider a lower toll or alternatives to fund the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'we need congestion pricing.' The matter, titled 'MTA boss ‘thrilled’ Kathy Hochul eyeing lower congestion toll after NY gov indefinitely paused controversial scheme,' highlights the urgency of MTA financing. Assemblywoman Deborah Glick noted Hochul’s commitment to a replacement plan. The bill’s status remains in flux, with no committee or vote recorded. The safety impact for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—was not assessed. The city’s most at-risk remain exposed as leaders argue over dollars and cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation will install up to 1,500 large, Madrid-made bins in West Harlem parking spaces, targeting buildings with more than 31 units. The pilot, launched last year, replaces sidewalk trash bags with secure, stationary bins. Abreu said, 'I couldn’t be more thrilled that Barcelona is making its way to New York City – but unfortunately for the rats, that means no tapas for them.' The bins, emptied by new trucks, have already reduced rat complaints and cleaned up streets. Some residents worry about lost parking, but others, like Esther Yoon, praise the cleaner, safer sidewalks. The city will spend up to $700,000 annually on the program, aiming to expand across all boroughs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority. The Council’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
