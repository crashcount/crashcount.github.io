Eleven left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, the streets of Manhattan CB7 have not spared the old or the young. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was struck and killed by an SUV. A 13-year-old girl died crossing Manhattan Avenue. A 74-year-old cyclist, helmet on, was killed at West End and 70th. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, families left with empty chairs.</p><p><strong>In the past year alone, crashes rose 17%. Deaths jumped from one to five.</strong> Serious injuries climbed. The dead are mostly pedestrians and cyclists. The killers are cars, trucks, SUVs. The city counts the bodies. The city waits.</p><h3 id=why-didnt-he-stop>&ldquo;Why Didn&rsquo;t He Stop?&rdquo;</h3><p>A woman stood on the street, horn blaring, as a driver kept coming. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he stop?

State Senator <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Brad Hoylman-Sigal</a> voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Both voted to extend school speed zones. But the default speed limit is still not 20 mph. The most dangerous drivers still roam free. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save you unless you make it.</strong> Call your council member.

The article, titled 'Opinion: Worried About E-Bike Safety? Make the Roads Safer First,' highlights the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians due to poor infrastructure. It supports Council Member Lincoln Restler’s bill to enforce bike and bus lane obstruction rules and backs state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal’s proposal for employer-based delivery worker licensing. The piece states: 'Such proposals are heavy-handed and will deter and discourage e-bike ridership without effectively ensuring their safe operations on the street.' The author urges protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and moving Citi Bike docks off sidewalks. The message is clear: systemic fixes, not punitive measures, protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The detour, implemented with scant notice, lacks protected bike lanes and clear signage. Cyclists must share space with cars, cross highway ramps, and navigate steep slopes. The matter, described as 'shortsighted' by Council Member Shaun Abreu, repeats failures from a similar closure four years ago. Abreu urged the city to create a 'sustainable, workable detour' for vulnerable riders. Cyclists voiced frustration and fear, with some riding on pedestrian paths or even the highway to avoid danger. The city’s reliance on 'Share the Road' signs and sharrows leaves riders exposed. The detour has led to nearly one injury per week, highlighting the city’s disregard for cyclist safety during infrastructure work.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT warns, 'motorists should expect the slowest traffic of the year in Midtown,' with average speeds dipping below 4 mph and key streets closed. Hoylman-Sigal, co-author of a new traffic report, highlights that Midtown speeds are the slowest since records began—20% slower than a decade ago. The report notes emergency response times have suffered. DOT continues a temporary bike lane for cyclists and micro-mobility users, with plans for a permanent design. Hoylman-Sigal supports congestion pricing and safer streets, but Governor Hochul has paused the plan. The city expects more gridlock days through December.

The project, a $300 million overhaul, is part of ongoing MTA accessibility efforts. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents District 47, praised the work: "There is a fundamental right to access mass transit. And today we are taking an important step forward in making that right real to all New Yorkers." The upgrades will make the complex fully accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Still, 23 other stations remain on hold after congestion pricing was paused, freezing $15 billion in planned improvements. Only 30% of stations are accessible.

The law orders the Department of Transportation to post current bicycle and micromobility ridership data online, updated monthly or at least yearly. The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Restler, Hudson, Schulman, and others. The law demands transparency on where riders travel and what DOT does to keep them safe. This opens the books on bike movement and exposes gaps in protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian was crossing against the signal when the collision occurred. The pedestrian sustained abrasions over her entire body and was conscious at the scene. The report identifies the moped driver's unsafe speed and driver inattention or distraction as contributing factors in the crash. The point of impact was the center front end of the moped, which was going straight ahead at the time. The pedestrian's crossing against the signal is noted but the primary causes cited are the driver's unsafe speed and inattention, emphasizing the systemic danger posed by driver errors in this incident.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Councilmember Shaun Abreu hails the pilot’s success. The bins cut sidewalk trash and rats. Streets change. Cars lose ground. Pedestrians and residents gain cleaner, safer space.</p><p class=mb3>On August 8, 2024, Councilmember Shaun Abreu, chair of the City Council's sanitation committee, announced the expansion of a sanitation pilot in District 7. The Department of Sanitation will install up to 1,500 large, Madrid-made bins in West Harlem parking spaces, targeting buildings with more than 31 units. The pilot, launched last year, replaces sidewalk trash bags with secure, stationary bins. Abreu said, 'I couldn’t be more thrilled that Barcelona is making its way to New York City – but unfortunately for the rats, that means no tapas for them.' The bins, emptied by new trucks, have already reduced rat complaints and cleaned up streets. Some residents worry about lost parking, but others, like Esther Yoon, praise the cleaner, safer sidewalks. The city will spend up to $700,000 annually on the program, aiming to expand across all boroughs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
