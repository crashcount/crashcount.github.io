Year to date: 5 deaths and 260 injuries. Crashes rose more than 21% over last year’s pace (city data).</p><h3 id=where-it-keeps-happening>Where it keeps happening</h3><p>Henry Hudson Parkway is the deadliest stretch in CB7: 2 people killed and 224 injured. Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue stack injury after injury. The worst hour is late afternoon: 4 p.m. alone saw 99 injuries in this period (city data).</p><p>Top contributing factors in CB7 include driver inattention/distraction, disregarding traffic control, failure to yield and unsafe speed. Private cars and SUVs cause most harm: SUVs account for 81 pedestrian injuries, including 4 deaths; sedans account for 77 pedestrian injuries (city data).</p><p>Fixes are not exotic. Make them local and fast: daylighting and leading pedestrian intervals on Broadway and Amsterdam; protected intersections and raised crosswalks near schools and senior centers; automated speed control, hardened lanes and targeted enforcement on Henry Hudson Parkway and at late-afternoon peaks.</p><h3 id=leaders-on-the-record>Leaders, on the record</h3><p>When DOT rolled out paid curb parking across 13 Upper West Side blocks overnight, the agency said, “Demand for curb space in the city is increasing, from trash collection and bike lanes to truck loading and parking” (West Side Spirit). CB7’s district manager said, “They didn’t provide a ton of notice” (West Side Spirit).</p><p>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery, the transportation commissioner said, “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection” (Gothamist). The Upper West Side needs that same urgency on Broadway and Amsterdam.</p><h3 id=whats-been-done--and-whats-missing>What’s been done — and what’s missing</h3><p>State Sen. Brad Hoylman‑Sigal voted yes in committee on S 4045, a bill to require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for repeat violators. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal co-sponsored the Assembly companion (A 2299) and backed measures to expand camera enforcement (A 7997). These moves matter. But CB7 still needs a citywide 20 mph default under Sammy’s Law and faster, physical turn‑calming on our deadly corners (policy and city data).</p><h3 id=do-not-look-away>Do not look away</h3><p>This is fixable. Push for daylighting and LPIs on Broadway and Amsterdam. Demand protected intersections and raised crossings by schools and senior centers. Insist on automated speed control and hardened lanes on Henry Hudson Parkway and targeted enforcement at the 4 p.m. peak. And press Albany and City Hall to use Sammy’s Law to set a 20 mph default citywide and to require speed limiters for habitual speeders.</p><p>Start here: /take_action/.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

City lawmakers oppose a payroll tax hike limited to New York City. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie offers only vague assurances. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warns the capital plan is as vital as Medicare. Federal officials, including U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, criticize subway neglect and demand improvements before aid. Gov. Hochul’s office claims progress and urges fair federal funding. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The system’s decay puts riders at risk. The clock ticks.

The collision occurred at 2:54 a.m. Both the Jeep SUV and the e-bike were traveling north. The report states the cyclist was 'crushed in the face,' her blood spreading on the asphalt, while the Jeep showed 'no damage.' Police cited 'Following Too Closely' as a contributing factor on the part of the SUV driver. The report also lists 'Other Vehicular' as a contributing factor. The cyclist was not ejected.
