Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council and DOT can act now. But the limit stands. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but their future is always in question. The city builds more bike lanes and redesigns intersections, but the work is slow. The NYPD cracks down on e-bike riders with criminal summonses, while drivers who kill often walk away. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The officers chased a stolen car from Manhattan to the Bronx. The vehicle crashed into a lamppost at the Dyckman Street exit, overturned, and caught fire. Firefighters later found an unidentified man dead in the driver’s seat. According to the article, the officers "allegedly returned to their command but did not report the crash." NYPD stated the pursuit violated department regulations. The Force Investigation Division and the New York Attorney General’s office are investigating.

The matter, described as a 'lack of a concrete plan from New York State leaders,' sits unresolved. Assembly Member Micah Lasher calls for regional funding, arguing suburbs benefit most. City lawmakers oppose a payroll tax hike limited to New York City. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie offers only vague assurances. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warns the capital plan is as vital as Medicare. Federal officials, including U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, criticize subway neglect and demand improvements before aid. Gov. Hochul’s office claims progress and urges fair federal funding. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The system’s decay puts riders at risk. The clock ticks.

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) will launch the program by June 1, 2025, with nearly 80% of apartments participating. The pilot, which follows earlier bin tests, repurposes parking spots for stationary bins. Abreu, co-sponsoring a bill with Council Member Crystal Hudson, called the shift 'a necessary public good' despite the loss of parking. The bill would require on-street containers for buildings with 10 or more units citywide by 2032. Advocates and DSNY officials highlight the benefit for pedestrians: 'People don’t want garbage on the sidewalk, and it makes perfect sense to put it in the roadway.' The pilot will run for a year, aiming to clear sidewalks and improve safety for those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, introduced on February 18, 2025, sits before the Senate. Its summary reads: 'Establishes in the city of New York a bicycle lane safety program to enforce certain restrictions on the use of bicycle lanes and/or protected bicycle lanes by means of bicycle lane photo devices.' Brad Hoylman-Sigal leads as primary sponsor, joined by Jabari Brisport, Kristen Gonzalez, Liz Krueger, Jessica Ramos, and Julia Salazar as co-sponsors. These lawmakers seek to use automated cameras to enforce bike lane rules, targeting drivers who endanger cyclists by blocking protected lanes. The bill does not blame victims.
