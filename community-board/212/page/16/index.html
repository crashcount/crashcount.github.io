She was 78. An SUV hit her. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.</a></p><p>A coach stood outside his home on Givan Avenue. A BMW and a pickup collided. The BMW spun, hit parked cars, hit the coach. He died. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last year, five people died on these streets. Seven hundred were hurt. Nine were left with injuries that change a life.</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Older New Yorkers and the young take the brunt.</strong> In the past 12 months, three people over 55 died. Sixty-one children were hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are mothers, fathers, neighbors, children. The street does not care. The cars do not stop.</p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. <strong>SUVs killed three. Cars and SUVs together left hundreds bleeding.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll, but the weight of steel is what crushes bones and ends breath.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Kevin Riley has co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks, scramble crosswalks, and better lighting. He voted to end jaywalking tickets and back solar crosswalks. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>No law has slowed the cars on White Plains Road. No new design has stopped the chain-reaction crashes on Givan Avenue.</strong></p><p>Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie helped <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>expand red light cameras</a>, but blocked the city from lowering speed limits for years. Only after years of delay did Albany <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>pass Sammy’s Law</a>. The streets waited. People died.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand street redesigns that protect people, not just cars. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

On May 15, 2024, more than a dozen local officials sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, urging passage before session’s end in June. The letter, organized by Local Progress, states: 'This means projects that expanded cycling infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, and public transit were prioritized over outdated highway expansions and lane widening.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill. Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.' The bill would force planners to consider car miles in every project, shifting focus from car movement to safer, people-first streets. The policy could help undo decades of harm from highways that split communities and reinforce segregation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On May 15, 2024, a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins called for swift passage before the session ends in June. The letter states, 'The state Legislature should pass the law before the end of this session in June, which could pivot transportation funding toward more beneficial uses like mass transit and biking and walking infrastructure.' Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key recipient. The bill would force agencies to prioritize projects for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders over highway expansion.
