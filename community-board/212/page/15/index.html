The MTA faces a $15 billion hole. Lawmakers argue over reviving congestion pricing with a lower toll. Transit hangs in the balance. Streets stay clogged. Riders and walkers wait for answers. No fix. No funding. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On July 2, 2024, state lawmakers, including Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (District 47), debated the future of congestion pricing and MTA funding. The matter, reported as 'MTA in dark over Gov. Hochul’s talks to revive congestion pricing with lower tolls,' highlights confusion and division. Hoylman-Sigal supports lowering the toll, saying, 'The goal should be mend it don’t end it.' He urges keeping the program alive to save mass transit. Sen. Liz Krueger is open to tweaks if goals are met. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow opposes any revival. The MTA faces a $15 billion shortfall after the program’s pause. Policy experts warn that lowering the toll could weaken congestion relief and transit funding. No clear plan exists. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as gridlock and uncertainty persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Comptroller DiNapoli warns of stalled upgrades, crumbling service, and years of pain for riders. Transit faces deep cuts. Streets stay clogged. Safety and air suffer.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2024, State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli issued a report blasting Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause on congestion pricing. The program, set to charge drivers $15 to enter Manhattan’s core, was expected to raise $15 billion for the MTA’s $55-billion capital plan. DiNapoli’s report, titled 'Loss of Congestion Pricing Revenue Leaves MTA With No Good Options,' warns that the MTA 'will be forced to put off badly needed investment in expansion and improvements to the system.' He stressed, 'Those choices will directly affect riders ... for years to come.' NYC Comptroller Brad Lander echoed support for congestion pricing, urging the governor to reconsider price points if it means moving forward. Activists plan to pressure the MTA board to resist the governor’s decision, citing the need to avoid transit cuts and deliver 'major traffic safety, air quality, and cost of living improvements for all New Yorkers.' The loss of funding threatens basic maintenance, reliability, and frequency, with no clear replacement in sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2024, Senator Chuck Schumer and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie made public statements regarding Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of New York’s congestion pricing program. The matter, described as 'Power Outage: Schumer, Heastie Won’t Fight Hochul’s Congestion Pricing ‘Pause’,' highlights both leaders’ support for congestion pricing and MTA funding, but neither will challenge the Governor’s decision. Heastie said, 'If you want me to attack the Governor for making a call, I’m sorry I’m not going to do that. I want to get the MTA funded.' Schumer, pressed by a constituent, affirmed his support but refused to publicly pressure Hochul, claiming she 'doesn’t react well to public pressure.' With the MTA board’s plan stalled and federal action pending, the program’s future is uncertain. No safety analyst has assessed the impact, but the continued delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed to the daily threat of traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
