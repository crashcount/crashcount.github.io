She was 78. An SUV hit her. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.</a></p><p>A coach stood outside his home on Givan Avenue. A BMW and a pickup collided. The BMW spun, hit parked cars, hit the coach. He died. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last year, five people died on these streets. Seven hundred were hurt. Nine were left with injuries that change a life.</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Older New Yorkers and the young take the brunt.</strong> In the past 12 months, three people over 55 died. Sixty-one children were hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are mothers, fathers, neighbors, children. The street does not care. The cars do not stop.</p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. <strong>SUVs killed three. Cars and SUVs together left hundreds bleeding.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll, but the weight of steel is what crushes bones and ends breath.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Kevin Riley has co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks, scramble crosswalks, and better lighting. He voted to end jaywalking tickets and back solar crosswalks. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>No law has slowed the cars on White Plains Road. No new design has stopped the chain-reaction crashes on Givan Avenue.</strong></p><p>Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie helped <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>expand red light cameras</a>, but blocked the city from lowering speed limits for years. Only after years of delay did Albany <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>pass Sammy’s Law</a>. The streets waited. People died.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand street redesigns that protect people, not just cars. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The impact occurred between a 2018 Dodge SUV traveling east and a 2016 Ford SUV traveling south. The driver of the Dodge SUV, a 39-year-old male occupant, was injured with an abrasion to his elbow and lower arm but remained conscious and was wearing a lap belt and harness. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'View Obstructed/Limited' as contributing factors to the crash. The Dodge driver’s limited view likely played a role in the collision, which involved impact to the right front bumper and right front quarter panel of the vehicles. No pedestrian or cyclist was involved, and no victim behaviors were noted as contributing factors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Hochul may slash the $68.4-billion MTA capital plan. Transit advocates rage. Riders face crumbling subways, broken promises. The governor holds the knife. The future of safe, reliable transit hangs in the balance. The buck stops with her.</p><p class=mb3>On September 30, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul announced she might not fill a $33-billion gap in the proposed 2025-2029 MTA capital plan, threatening to shrink the $68.4-billion package approved by the MTA Board. The plan now awaits review by the Capital Plan Review Board, which has 90 days to approve or reject it. The matter centers on whether the governor will force cuts to desperately needed repairs and upgrades. Advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance demand Hochul fund 'the reliable, accessible, resilient service we've long been denied but that we need and deserve.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls out Hochul’s record, urging her to cut her own Interborough Express project first if reductions come. The MTA declined comment. The fate of New York’s transit—and the safety of millions who rely on it—rests on this decision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

His body crushed beneath steel.' The pedestrian was crossing with the signal at the intersection, as explicitly noted in the police data.

The sedan was traveling west and was making a left turn when it struck the moped, which was traveling east straight ahead. The point of impact was the sedan’s right rear quarter panel and the moped’s left front bumper. The moped driver, a 55-year-old male, was ejected from his vehicle and sustained injuries to his entire body, including whiplash, with an injury severity rated at level 3. The sedan’s driver was licensed and male, but the report lists the moped driver’s contributing factors as unspecified. No explicit driver errors such as failure to yield were cited, but the collision during a left turn suggests a critical driver action led to the impact. Both vehicles suffered significant damage to their right side doors and front ends respectively.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
