Hochul and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie in demanding increased federal funding for the MTA. Their letter to President Trump and congressional leaders argued, 'Mass transit must be federally funded at a level commensurate to its importance to our nation and New York must receive its fair share.' The officials seek $14 billion for the MTA’s 2025-2029 capital plan, citing a $30 billion gap and the system’s outsized national role. The request comes as federal transit money from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law nears expiration. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis opposed the request, citing MTA mismanagement. Federal Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy threatened to withhold funds over safety data and congestion pricing disputes. The bill is not a council measure but a coordinated state push, with Stewart-Cousins mentioned as a leading voice. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the lawmakers’ action highlights the stakes for millions of vulnerable transit riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Citizens Budget Commission urges deep cuts, fare hikes, and more city and state cash. Expansion projects like the Interborough Express may die. Riders risk worse service if lawmakers stall. The clock ticks.</p><p class=mb3>On March 21, 2025, the Citizens Budget Commission (CBC) released a warning about the MTA’s $33.4-billion capital budget gap for 2025–2029. The CBC recommends slashing $17 billion, scrapping expansion plans like the Interborough Express, and boosting city and state contributions by $9 billion. The CBC calls for a 6 percent hike in fares, tolls, and vehicle fees—higher than the planned 4 percent. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said tax hikes are on the table. Governor Hochul’s office backs a payroll tax hike, but the CBC wants it regionalized. The CBC’s Andrew Rein said, “We have to prioritize state-of-good-repair, basic modernization, and delay some of the system expansions.” The report warns that failing to fund maintenance will gut service, repeating past crises. No direct safety analysis was provided, but cuts threaten transit reliability for millions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Steve Chan slams the move as a blow to city businesses. Closed-door talks continue. Transit riders wait. Streets stay dangerous. No clear safety gains for walkers or cyclists.</p><p class=mb3>State budget negotiations on March 20, 2025, centered on funding for the MTA. Lawmakers discussed raising the payroll mobility tax on large New York City employers. The measure aims to close a $35 billion hole in the MTA’s five-year capital plan, which covers subway and bus upgrades. The bill has no number yet and remains under negotiation. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, 'The discussion on revenue raisers is definitely going to have to be a part of the MTA.' Senator Steve Chan, District 17, criticized the tax hike, calling it 'a slap on the Brooklyn businesses struggling for survival in my district.' The talks also floated surcharges on for-hire vehicles and online deliveries. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The budget deadline looms. Riders and pedestrians see no promised relief.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets choke with blocked bike lanes and chaos. Manual enforcement fails. DOT backs automation. Some lawmakers resist, call for cops. Vulnerable road users left dodging danger as debate drags.</p><p class=mb3>On March 3, 2025, a legislative proposal surfaced to deploy automated parking enforcement cameras across New York City. Assemblymember Steven Raga leads the push for a $35 million pilot, aiming to install 150 cameras targeting double parking and illegal stops. The bill, not yet assigned a committee or number, seeks to automate enforcement where manual efforts fall short. Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead. The Department of Transportation supports the expansion, stating, 'Automated enforcement has proven to change driver behavior and make our streets safer for everyone.' The debate centers on whether automation or police presence best protects pedestrians and cyclists from blocked lanes and traffic hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
