The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a 30 percent drop in violations on enforced corridors. The matter summary states, 'Success: Drivers are Slowing Down on Streets with 24/7 Speed Cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the expanded enforcement 'a highly effective tool to keep New Yorkers safe.' Key corridors saw dramatic reductions: 96 percent on Houston Street, 74 percent on North Conduit Boulevard, 68 percent on Bruckner Boulevard. Injuries fell at high-crash sites—45 percent on Tremont Avenue, 33 percent on Kings Highway, 16 percent on Queens Boulevard, 19 percent on Hylan Boulevard. Automated cameras issued over 3.7 million tickets, dwarfing police efforts. Despite progress, cyclist injuries are on pace for a record high, and advocates now push for city control over speed limits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'Success: Drivers are Slowing Down on Streets with 24/7 Speed Cameras.' Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie is mentioned for opposing city control over speed limits, a move sought by Families for Safe Streets after continued traffic deaths and injuries. Key corridors saw sharp drops in speeding and injuries, but cyclist injuries remain high. The expanded camera program replaced limited weekday enforcement, shifting the burden from NYPD to automated systems. The data shows cameras work, but the fight for safer streets—especially for cyclists—remains unfinished.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
