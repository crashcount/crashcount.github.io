On Monday, Aug. 11, two riders went down on the Bronx River Parkway. Police say a 2019 Mercedes tried to pass a 2015 Volkswagen near East 223rd Street. The car hit. The bikes fell. Both riders were thrown and later died at the hospital, identified as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, according to <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>NYPD <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/fatal-7-car-crash-on-bronx-river-parkway/>said</a>, &ldquo;Two men on motorcycles were killed in the crash overnight near East Gun Hill Road.&rdquo;</p><p>A sister stood in the courthouse. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just walking freely?

He was drunk,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>said</a> Clari Amarante Penalo.</p><p>The toll in CB12
In the last 12 months: 11 people killed and 12 seriously injured in CB12, across 1,153 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crashes</a>. This year to date: crashes up 11% and injuries up 23% versus last year to date, per the same <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>dataset</a>.</p><p>Names change; the pattern holds. Nov. 30, 2024: a 60-year-old man <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> while walking at Eastchester Rd and Givan Ave; factors include driver inattention and unsafe speed. Dec. 1, 2024: a 24-year-old cyclist <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> at E 233rd St and Webster Ave. May 24, 2025: a 76-year-old woman <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> while walking on White Plains Rd at E 216th St; driver inattention cited.</p><p>What leaders did — and didn’t
State Sen. Jamaal Bailey voted yes in June to move <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a>, a bill to require speed-limiters for repeat dangerous drivers. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie let NYC’s speed‑limit <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>bill</a> die without a vote in 2023. He also oversaw a major <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>red-light camera</a> expansion in 2024. Lawmakers <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/new-push-for-automated-ticketing-of-drivers-who-double-park-in-nyc>floated automated double-parking cameras</a> this year to keep lanes clear.</p><p>Credit for votes that save lives. No passes for delay that costs them.</p><p>What you can do now
Call Sen. Bailey and Speaker Heastie. Demand a floor vote on S4045. Back full deployment of red‑light and parking cameras. Push NYC DOT and NYPD to protect people outside cars on the Bronx River Parkway, White Plains Rd, and Webster Ave.</p><p>Do not look away. Two young men are dead. The next call could be yours.</p><p>Street safety in Bronx CB12 is central to Vision Zero. Prevent pedestrian injuries by pressing NYC DOT, NYPD, and the district’s council member to act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.

If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action.

Committee: State legislature, with final approval by the Capital Program Review Board. The OBTA, created in 2018, collects a taxi surcharge as 'Phase I' of congestion pricing. The first $300 million funded subway repairs; the next $50 million now goes to projects chosen by state legislators and the governor. The bill summary notes, 'A special fund created in 2018 to pay for transportation 'carrots' intended to counteract the supposed stick of congestion pricing finally has a balance of tens of millions of dollars.' Assembly Member Nily Rozic (D-Queens) secured restored Q46 bus service. Lisa Daglian of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA called for a weekly City Ticket. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance demanded better bus service, saying, 'The most important thing is better bus service.' The fund will shape how New Yorkers travel as congestion pricing nears.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, which would let New York City control its own speed limits, stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refused to allow a vote, despite majority support. Brooklyn Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, a strong supporter, noted, 'Even [lawmakers] who had City Council members from their districts supporting the bill were still not interested.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.' City data shows a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit reduction.

The fight continues in Albany.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, a state bill, would let New York City control its own speed limits. The measure stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie blocked a vote, despite support from Governor Hochul, the state Senate, Mayor Adams, and the City Council. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal, who sponsors the bill, rallied outside Heastie’s office, saying, 'Last year, 257 people were killed on New York City streets by reckless and speeding drivers. Each of these deaths was preventable.' Amy Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed in 2013, called for urgent action: 'We can’t wait any longer. People like Sammy, and so many others are dying on our streets.' Advocates point to a 36-percent drop in pedestrian deaths after the city lowered speed limits in 2014. The bill would not set new limits automatically, but would give the city the power to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
