Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (District 83) led the session. The agenda included several items, among them 'Sammy’s Law,' a proposal to allow New York City to set 20 mph speed limits on some streets. The matter summary notes: 'A backlash to traffic safety initiatives—particularly in the outer boroughs—is also driving resistance against the proposed 'Sammy’s Law' to allow for a 20 m.p.h. speed limit on some New York City streets.' Amy Cohen, whose son was killed in a crash, urged lawmakers to act, asking, 'How many more families are going to have to suffer before the Assembly takes this preventable crisis seriously?' Despite claims of enough votes, resistance remained strong. Heastie did not bring the bill to a floor vote.

Heastie’s state vehicle was caught speeding 12 times in school zones. He claims staffers were driving. Transportation Chair Bill Magnarelli suggested the bill’s fate might have changed if the City Council had acted sooner, a claim the Council disputes. Heastie’s spokesman said, 'He reminded them that the reason we passed the speed-camera legislation was to ensure the safety of students and the public, and that these violations are unacceptable.'

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest. The council’s action centers the lives of pedestrians and cyclists, demanding the city act before more are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Amy Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed in 2013, and Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, whose son Bryan was killed in 2006, lead the protest. Mendieta-Cuapio says, 'We need to pass Sammy's Law today, no more excuses.' Lawmakers hide behind closed doors. The mothers refuse to let their children’s deaths be ignored.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Grief meets gridlock.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2023, State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and advocates launched a hunger strike at the State Capitol for Sammy’s Law. The bill, introduced by Hoylman-Sigal and carried in the Assembly by Linda Rosenthal, would let New York City set speed limits below 25 mph. The official summary states it 'would authorize NYC to set speed limits below 25 mph but would not automatically change them.' Amy Cohen and Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, mothers whose children were killed by drivers, lead the protest. Despite majority City Council support and a home rule message, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refuses to bring the bill to a vote. Advocates accuse lawmakers of hiding and demand transparency. The hunger strike exposes the human cost of legislative inaction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
