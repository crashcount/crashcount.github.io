Three people were injured: an 18-year-old male driver with neck injuries, a 30-year-old female driver, and a 39-year-old male front passenger, both with full-body injuries. All suffered whiplash and remained conscious. The report lists driver inattention and distraction as contributing factors for both drivers. The crash involved impacts to the center front end and left side doors. No one was ejected. No safety equipment was reported in use. The crash underscores the danger of driver distraction, as documented in the police report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The Senate passed it, but Speaker Carl Heastie did not bring it to a vote in the Assembly, despite 60 co-sponsors and strong support from city lawmakers, Governor Hochul, and Mayor Adams. The bill, named for 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a speeding driver, would have allowed the city to lower most speed limits from 25 to 20 mph. Heastie cited concerns over e-bikes and speed bumps, saying, 'I'm not a dictator.' Advocates, including Sammy's mother Amy Cohen, condemned the move as 'Albany backroom politics at its worst.' The Department of Transportation called the bill vital for targeted street safety. Vulnerable road users remain exposed as the Assembly stalls action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (District 83) led the session. The agenda included several items, among them 'Sammy’s Law,' a proposal to allow New York City to set 20 mph speed limits on some streets. The matter summary notes: 'A backlash to traffic safety initiatives—particularly in the outer boroughs—is also driving resistance against the proposed 'Sammy’s Law' to allow for a 20 m.p.h. speed limit on some New York City streets.' Amy Cohen, whose son was killed in a crash, urged lawmakers to act, asking, 'How many more families are going to have to suffer before the Assembly takes this preventable crisis seriously?' Despite claims of enough votes, resistance remained strong. Heastie did not bring the bill to a floor vote. No direct safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s matter summary: 'the years-long effort to earn New York City the power to set its own speed limits.' Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill, but Heastie’s inaction blocks a vote. Activists, including Families for Safe Streets, protested with a die-in at Heastie’s office. Gary Eckstein, father of Sammy Cohen Eckstein, spoke of the pain caused by legislative failure. The legislature’s refusal to act leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as lawmakers avoid accountability and delay a measure with broad support.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refused to bring it to a vote, despite majority support in the Assembly. Amy Cohen, co-founder of Families for Safe Streets, condemned Heastie, saying, 'There’s only one roadblock: Speaker Carl Heastie refusing to call a vote on a popular, life-saving bill.' Activists warned that more preventable deaths will follow if the Assembly does not act. The Assembly is expected to reconvene later in the month to address unfinished business, possibly including Sammy's Law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Speaker Carl Heastie (District 83) has not called a floor vote as of June 9, 2023, despite the bill passing the State Senate. The bill, championed by advocates, would let New York City set 20-mile-per-hour speed limits on some streets. The matter summary states, 'Heastie has not called a floor vote on Sammy’s Law, which would allow New York City to set a 20-mile-per-hour speed limit on some streets.' Heastie’s state vehicle was caught speeding 12 times in school zones. He claims staffers were driving. Transportation Chair Bill Magnarelli suggested the bill’s fate might have changed if the City Council had acted sooner, a claim the Council disputes. Heastie’s spokesman said, 'He reminded them that the reason we passed the speed-camera legislation was to ensure the safety of students and the public, and that these violations are unacceptable.'
