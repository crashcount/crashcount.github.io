She was 78. An SUV hit her. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.</a></p><p>A coach stood outside his home on Givan Avenue. A BMW and a pickup collided. The BMW spun, hit parked cars, hit the coach. He died. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last year, five people died on these streets. Seven hundred were hurt. Nine were left with injuries that change a life.</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Older New Yorkers and the young take the brunt.</strong> In the past 12 months, three people over 55 died. Sixty-one children were hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are mothers, fathers, neighbors, children. The street does not care. The cars do not stop.</p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. <strong>SUVs killed three. Cars and SUVs together left hundreds bleeding.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll, but the weight of steel is what crushes bones and ends breath.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Kevin Riley has co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks, scramble crosswalks, and better lighting. He voted to end jaywalking tickets and back solar crosswalks. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>No law has slowed the cars on White Plains Road. No new design has stopped the chain-reaction crashes on Givan Avenue.</strong></p><p>Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie helped <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>expand red light cameras</a>, but blocked the city from lowering speed limits for years. Only after years of delay did Albany <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>pass Sammy’s Law</a>. The streets waited. People died.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand street redesigns that protect people, not just cars. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The bill demands weather-proof shelters and storage, aiming to meet the city’s cycling surge. Lawmakers want fewer cars, more bikes, and safer streets for all.</p><p class=mb3>On February 29, 2024, Council Member Chris Marte introduced a bill in the New York City Council requiring covered bike parking in parks and city-owned buildings. The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Eric Dinowitz, is under committee review. The legislation states, 'the city would have to install between one and five weather-proof enclosures with six to eight spaces apiece, depending on the size of the park.' Parks over 2.5 acres must have at least one shelter; parks over 250 acres need five. City buildings over 10,000 square feet, including public schools, must provide bike storage for workers and visitors. Marte said, 'If we want to get off the reliance of people commuting by car, we have to offer them alternative ways to get there.' The Parks Department and city agencies must report on implementation or explain impracticality. This bill targets safer, more accessible bike infrastructure for New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They condemned the use of Outer Borough Transit Account (OBTA) funds for toll rebates instead of transit improvements. The OBTA, created in 2018 from a surcharge on Manhattan taxi and for-hire rides, was meant to boost transit service or lower fares outside Manhattan. Yet, $22.2 million has gone to toll rebates for drivers in the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. Only one transit project—the Far Rockaway City Ticket—has seen funding. Riders Alliance Director Danny Pearlstein said, “The Outer Borough Transit Account should clearly also help the millions of people outside Manhattan who don't have cars and who depend on public transit.” Lawmakers have not responded.
