She was 78. An SUV hit her. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.</a></p><p>A coach stood outside his home on Givan Avenue. A BMW and a pickup collided. The BMW spun, hit parked cars, hit the coach. He died. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child.

Nine were left with injuries that change a life.</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Older New Yorkers and the young take the brunt.</strong> In the past 12 months, three people over 55 died. Sixty-one children were hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are mothers, fathers, neighbors, children. The street does not care. The cars do not stop.</p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. <strong>SUVs killed three. Cars and SUVs together left hundreds bleeding.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll, but the weight of steel is what crushes bones and ends breath.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Kevin Riley has co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks, scramble crosswalks, and better lighting. He voted to end jaywalking tickets and back solar crosswalks. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>No law has slowed the cars on White Plains Road. No new design has stopped the chain-reaction crashes on Givan Avenue.</strong></p><p>Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie helped <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>expand red light cameras</a>, but blocked the city from lowering speed limits for years. Only after years of delay did Albany <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>pass Sammy’s Law</a>. The streets waited.

Violations dropped 30 percent in one year. Streets once deadly saw sharp falls in speeding and injuries. Cameras outpaced cops, issuing millions of tickets. Still, cyclist injuries climb. The fight for safer streets continues.</p><p class=mb3>This report details the outcome of New York City's 24/7 speed camera enforcement, launched August 1, 2022. The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a 30 percent drop in violations on enforced corridors. The matter summary states, 'Success: Drivers are Slowing Down on Streets with 24/7 Speed Cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the expanded enforcement 'a highly effective tool to keep New Yorkers safe.' Key corridors saw dramatic reductions: 96 percent on Houston Street, 74 percent on North Conduit Boulevard, 68 percent on Bruckner Boulevard. Injuries fell at high-crash sites—45 percent on Tremont Avenue, 33 percent on Kings Highway, 16 percent on Queens Boulevard, 19 percent on Hylan Boulevard. Automated cameras issued over 3.7 million tickets, dwarfing police efforts. Despite progress, cyclist injuries are on pace for a record high, and advocates now push for city control over speed limits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Violations dropped 30 percent in a year. Streets once deadly see fewer crashes. But injuries still rise for cyclists. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie stands against city control of speed limits. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>This policy outcome report, published August 28, 2023, covers the first year of 24/7 speed camera enforcement in New York City. The Department of Transportation reports a 30 percent drop in violations since cameras began operating around the clock on August 1, 2022. The report states, 'Success: Drivers are Slowing Down on Streets with 24/7 Speed Cameras.' Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie is mentioned for opposing city control over speed limits, a move sought by Families for Safe Streets after continued traffic deaths and injuries. Key corridors saw sharp drops in speeding and injuries, but cyclist injuries remain high. The expanded camera program replaced limited weekday enforcement, shifting the burden from NYPD to automated systems. The data shows cameras work, but the fight for safer streets—especially for cyclists—remains unfinished.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pedestrians keep crossing in the dark.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1151-2023, introduced August 3, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, aimed to require the Department of Transportation to install at least 100 illuminated, solar-powered traffic control devices at crosswalks each year for five years—a total of 500. The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The city’s crosswalks remain unchanged. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot starts September 24.</p><p class=mb3>On July 17, 2023, the MTA announced a fare-free bus pilot covering five routes: Bx18 (Bronx), B60 (Brooklyn), M116 (Manhattan), Q4 (Queens), and S46/96 (Staten Island). The program, part of the state budget, begins September 24 and will last six to twelve months. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, representing District 83, highlighted the benefit to thousands who rely on buses for work, school, and medical needs. The pilot waives fares to expand access and improve transit equity, as stated: 'By establishing these fare-free bus pilot routes, we are expanding access to public transportation across the city and improving transit equity to better serve all New Yorkers.' Advocates wanted all buses free, but the plan was scaled back in budget talks. The MTA will review impacts on ridership, service, and costs after six months.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
