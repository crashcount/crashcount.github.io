A 27-year-old male bicyclist, traveling north and wearing a helmet, was partially ejected from his bike and sustained a fracture and dislocation to his elbow, lower arm, and hand. The report identifies the contributing factor as 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' by the sedan driver, who was going straight ahead. The bicyclist was incoherent after the impact, highlighting the severity of the collision. The sedan, a 2022 Toyota registered in New Jersey, was also traveling straight ahead. The bicyclist was unlicensed but this was not cited as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the dangers posed by drivers failing to yield to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill demands weather-proof shelters and storage, aiming to meet the city’s cycling surge. Lawmakers want fewer cars, more bikes, and safer streets for all.</p><p class=mb3>On February 29, 2024, Council Member Chris Marte introduced a bill in the New York City Council requiring covered bike parking in parks and city-owned buildings. The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Eric Dinowitz, is under committee review. The legislation states, 'the city would have to install between one and five weather-proof enclosures with six to eight spaces apiece, depending on the size of the park.' Parks over 2.5 acres must have at least one shelter; parks over 250 acres need five. City buildings over 10,000 square feet, including public schools, must provide bike storage for workers and visitors. Marte said, 'If we want to get off the reliance of people commuting by car, we have to offer them alternative ways to get there.' The Parks Department and city agencies must report on implementation or explain impracticality. This bill targets safer, more accessible bike infrastructure for New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
