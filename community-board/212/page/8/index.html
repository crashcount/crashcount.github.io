Ten people are dead. Thirty-two are left with serious injuries. Two thousand five hundred and one are hurt. These are not numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are gone or broken, and the street keeps moving.</p><p>A 76-year-old woman was killed on White Plains Road. A 24-year-old cyclist crushed at E 233rd Street. A 64-year-old man, crossing with the signal, did not make it to the other side. The list goes on. Each death is a hole in a family. Each injury is a life changed.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In the last three years, SUVs and cars killed four people and left 98 with moderate or serious injuries. Trucks and buses hurt nine. Motorcycles and mopeds, two. One person was killed riding a bike. The street is a gauntlet, and the odds are not in your favor if you are on foot or two wheels.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They say, &ldquo;Every New Yorker deserves safe streets, and thanks to historic investments in better street designs… our streets are safer than ever&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.gov/visionzero>said DOT Commissioner Rodriguez</a>. But the blood on the pavement says otherwise.</p><p>Speed cameras now run all day and night. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done so everywhere. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are made. Action is slow.</p><h2 id=the-voices-left-behind>The Voices Left Behind</h2><p>A mother, after her son was killed in a road rage shooting, said, &ldquo;My son was like my best friend to me.

Her words are a wound that does not close.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the return of the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Demand streets that do not kill. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
