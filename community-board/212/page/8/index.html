Streets choke with blocked bike lanes and chaos. Manual enforcement fails. DOT backs automation. Some lawmakers resist, call for cops. Vulnerable road users left dodging danger as debate drags.</p><p class=mb3>On March 3, 2025, a legislative proposal surfaced to deploy automated parking enforcement cameras across New York City. Assemblymember Steven Raga leads the push for a $35 million pilot, aiming to install 150 cameras targeting double parking and illegal stops. The bill, not yet assigned a committee or number, seeks to automate enforcement where manual efforts fall short. Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead. The Department of Transportation supports the expansion, stating, 'Automated enforcement has proven to change driver behavior and make our streets safer for everyone.' The debate centers on whether automation or police presence best protects pedestrians and cyclists from blocked lanes and traffic hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The federal action canceled the $9 toll meant to fund the MTA’s capital plan, threatening $16 billion for transit upgrades. The matter drew sharp words: Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, 'The president and the Republican members of New York's congressional delegation ... just blew a $16-billion hole in the most important transit system in the nation.' Subway riders at Canal Street called the move 'insane' and accused Trump of ignoring New Yorkers. Advocates and everyday riders warned that ending congestion pricing would slow commutes, worsen traffic, and put vulnerable road users at greater risk.

The MTA’s $68-billion plan faces a $33-billion gap. State leaders stalled, leaving riders and infrastructure in limbo. Advocates demand reliable, timely funding.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2025, MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber addressed state legislators, pressing for stable, recurring state funding for the MTA’s 2025-2029 capital plan. The $68-billion plan, approved by the MTA Board, has only $35 billion secured. State leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, rejected the plan’s funding gap, insisting it be resolved in the state budget. Lieber argued, 'the MTA capital budget is totally predictable... no different than Medicaid and education.' He called for the state to treat transit infrastructure as a core, recurring expense. Advocates like Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany echoed this, demanding the state guarantee timely payments and accountability. Governor Hochul and legislative leaders voiced support but offered no concrete solutions. The debate leaves the city’s transit riders waiting for action and exposes them to the risks of delayed repairs and unreliable service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
