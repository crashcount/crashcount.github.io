The impact occurred at the SUV's left rear bumper, causing damage to that area. Two occupants in the SUV, a 34-year-old male front passenger and a 26-year-old female left rear passenger, were injured with whiplash and upper body trauma. Both were conscious and wearing lap belts. The report identifies 'Following Too Closely' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors to the crash. The pickup truck driver failed to maintain a safe distance behind the stationary SUV, leading to the collision. No victim behaviors were noted as contributing factors. The crash highlights driver errors in attention and spacing as central causes of injury to vulnerable vehicle occupants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Streets choke with blocked bike lanes and chaos. Manual enforcement fails. DOT backs automation. Some lawmakers resist, call for cops. Vulnerable road users left dodging danger as debate drags.</p><p class=mb3>On March 3, 2025, a legislative proposal surfaced to deploy automated parking enforcement cameras across New York City. Assemblymember Steven Raga leads the push for a $35 million pilot, aiming to install 150 cameras targeting double parking and illegal stops. The bill, not yet assigned a committee or number, seeks to automate enforcement where manual efforts fall short. Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead. The Department of Transportation supports the expansion, stating, 'Automated enforcement has proven to change driver behavior and make our streets safer for everyone.' The debate centers on whether automation or police presence best protects pedestrians and cyclists from blocked lanes and traffic hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Subway riders fumed. The city lost billions for transit. Streets will clog again. Danger rises for those on foot and bike. Riders called the move insane. Politicians slammed the decision. The city’s lifeline is at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, President Trump ended New York City’s congestion pricing program, just weeks after it began. The federal action canceled the $9 toll meant to fund the MTA’s capital plan, threatening $16 billion for transit upgrades. The matter drew sharp words: Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, 'The president and the Republican members of New York's congressional delegation ... just blew a $16-billion hole in the most important transit system in the nation.' Subway riders at Canal Street called the move 'insane' and accused Trump of ignoring New Yorkers. Advocates and everyday riders warned that ending congestion pricing would slow commutes, worsen traffic, and put vulnerable road users at greater risk. The city’s future now hangs in the balance, with transit funding gutted and streets set to fill with cars again.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
