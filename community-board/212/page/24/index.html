The pilot starts September 24.</p><p class=mb3>"This pilot program will help thousands of New Yorkers who rely on buses to get to work, to school, to get to medical appoints and more. It was a priority for many of my Assembly Majority colleagues, and we look forward to seeing how it impacts our communities." -- Carl Heastie</p><p class=mb3>On July 17, 2023, the MTA announced a fare-free bus pilot covering five routes: Bx18 (Bronx), B60 (Brooklyn), M116 (Manhattan), Q4 (Queens), and S46/96 (Staten Island). The program, part of the state budget, begins September 24 and will last six to twelve months. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, representing District 83, highlighted the benefit to thousands who rely on buses for work, school, and medical needs. The pilot waives fares to expand access and improve transit equity, as stated: 'By establishing these fare-free bus pilot routes, we are expanding access to public transportation across the city and improving transit equity to better serve all New Yorkers.' Advocates wanted all buses free, but the plan was scaled back in budget talks. The MTA will review impacts on ridership, service, and costs after six months.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
