The intersection stays dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on April 6, 2025, that Inza Fofana, a 52-year-old hospital cleaner and immigrant, was fatally struck after his shift at Lincoln Hospital. The crash occurred midblock at E. 149th St. and Morris Ave. Police said a 2019 Ford Transit van, turning left, hit Fofana as he crossed. The article quotes his sister-in-law: "He was going to buy socks. That's why he crossed the street." Police told the family that after the initial impact, two more vehicles struck Fofana. The driver remained at the scene and faced no immediate charges. Family members called for more safety measures at the busy intersection, noting, "There has to be a cross guard over there for the pedestrian to cross the street safely." The incident highlights ongoing risks for pedestrians at wide, high-traffic Bronx crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
