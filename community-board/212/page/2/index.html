She was 78. An SUV hit her. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.</a></p><p>A coach stood outside his home on Givan Avenue. A BMW and a pickup collided. The BMW spun, hit parked cars, hit the coach. He died. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last year, five people died on these streets. Seven hundred were hurt. Nine were left with injuries that change a life.</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Older New Yorkers and the young take the brunt.</strong> In the past 12 months, three people over 55 died. Sixty-one children were hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are mothers, fathers, neighbors, children. The street does not care. The cars do not stop.</p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. <strong>SUVs killed three. Cars and SUVs together left hundreds bleeding.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll, but the weight of steel is what crushes bones and ends breath.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Kevin Riley has co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks, scramble crosswalks, and better lighting. He voted to end jaywalking tickets and back solar crosswalks. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>No law has slowed the cars on White Plains Road. No new design has stopped the chain-reaction crashes on Givan Avenue.</strong></p><p>Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie helped <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>expand red light cameras</a>, but blocked the city from lowering speed limits for years. Only after years of delay did Albany <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>pass Sammy’s Law</a>. The streets waited. People died.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand street redesigns that protect people, not just cars. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.
