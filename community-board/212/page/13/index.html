On Monday, Aug. 11, two riders went down on the Bronx River Parkway. Police say a 2019 Mercedes tried to pass a 2015 Volkswagen near East 223rd Street. The car hit. The bikes fell. Both riders were thrown and later died at the hospital, identified as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, according to <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>NYPD <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/fatal-7-car-crash-on-bronx-river-parkway/>said</a>, &ldquo;Two men on motorcycles were killed in the crash overnight near East Gun Hill Road.&rdquo;</p><p>A sister stood in the courthouse. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just walking freely?

He was drunk,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>said</a> Clari Amarante Penalo.</p><p>The toll in CB12
In the last 12 months: 11 people killed and 12 seriously injured in CB12, across 1,153 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crashes</a>. This year to date: crashes up 11% and injuries up 23% versus last year to date, per the same <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>dataset</a>.</p><p>Names change; the pattern holds. Nov. 30, 2024: a 60-year-old man <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> while walking at Eastchester Rd and Givan Ave; factors include driver inattention and unsafe speed. Dec. 1, 2024: a 24-year-old cyclist <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> at E 233rd St and Webster Ave. May 24, 2025: a 76-year-old woman <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> while walking on White Plains Rd at E 216th St; driver inattention cited.</p><p>What leaders did — and didn’t
State Sen. Jamaal Bailey voted yes in June to move <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a>, a bill to require speed-limiters for repeat dangerous drivers. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie let NYC’s speed‑limit <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>bill</a> die without a vote in 2023. He also oversaw a major <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>red-light camera</a> expansion in 2024. Lawmakers <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/new-push-for-automated-ticketing-of-drivers-who-double-park-in-nyc>floated automated double-parking cameras</a> this year to keep lanes clear.</p><p>Credit for votes that save lives. No passes for delay that costs them.</p><p>What you can do now
Call Sen. Bailey and Speaker Heastie. Demand a floor vote on S4045. Back full deployment of red‑light and parking cameras. Push NYC DOT and NYPD to protect people outside cars on the Bronx River Parkway, White Plains Rd, and Webster Ave.</p><p>Do not look away. Two young men are dead. The next call could be yours.</p><p>Street safety in Bronx CB12 is central to Vision Zero. Prevent pedestrian injuries by pressing NYC DOT, NYPD, and the district’s council member to act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact occurred between a 2018 Dodge SUV traveling east and a 2016 Ford SUV traveling south. The driver of the Dodge SUV, a 39-year-old male occupant, was injured with an abrasion to his elbow and lower arm but remained conscious and was wearing a lap belt and harness. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'View Obstructed/Limited' as contributing factors to the crash. The Dodge driver’s limited view likely played a role in the collision, which involved impact to the right front bumper and right front quarter panel of the vehicles. No pedestrian or cyclist was involved, and no victim behaviors were noted as contributing factors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Hochul may slash the $68.4-billion MTA capital plan. Transit advocates rage. Riders face crumbling subways, broken promises. The governor holds the knife. The future of safe, reliable transit hangs in the balance. The buck stops with her.</p><p class=mb3>On September 30, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul announced she might not fill a $33-billion gap in the proposed 2025-2029 MTA capital plan, threatening to shrink the $68.4-billion package approved by the MTA Board. The plan now awaits review by the Capital Plan Review Board, which has 90 days to approve or reject it. The matter centers on whether the governor will force cuts to desperately needed repairs and upgrades. Advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance demand Hochul fund 'the reliable, accessible, resilient service we've long been denied but that we need and deserve.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls out Hochul’s record, urging her to cut her own Interborough Express project first if reductions come. The MTA declined comment. The fate of New York’s transit—and the safety of millions who rely on it—rests on this decision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
