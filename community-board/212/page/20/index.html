She was 78. An SUV hit her. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.</a></p><p>A coach stood outside his home on Givan Avenue. A BMW and a pickup collided. The BMW spun, hit parked cars, hit the coach. He died. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last year, five people died on these streets. Seven hundred were hurt. Nine were left with injuries that change a life.</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Older New Yorkers and the young take the brunt.</strong> In the past 12 months, three people over 55 died. Sixty-one children were hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are mothers, fathers, neighbors, children. The street does not care. The cars do not stop.</p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. <strong>SUVs killed three. Cars and SUVs together left hundreds bleeding.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll, but the weight of steel is what crushes bones and ends breath.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Kevin Riley has co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks, scramble crosswalks, and better lighting. He voted to end jaywalking tickets and back solar crosswalks. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>No law has slowed the cars on White Plains Road. No new design has stopped the chain-reaction crashes on Givan Avenue.</strong></p><p>Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie helped <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>expand red light cameras</a>, but blocked the city from lowering speed limits for years. Only after years of delay did Albany <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>pass Sammy’s Law</a>. The streets waited. People died.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

It was a priority for many of my Assembly Majority colleagues, and we look forward to seeing how it impacts our communities." -- Carl Heastie</p><p class=mb3>On July 17, 2023, the MTA announced a fare-free bus pilot covering five routes: Bx18 (Bronx), B60 (Brooklyn), M116 (Manhattan), Q4 (Queens), and S46/96 (Staten Island). The program, part of the state budget, begins September 24 and will last six to twelve months. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, representing District 83, highlighted the benefit to thousands who rely on buses for work, school, and medical needs. The pilot waives fares to expand access and improve transit equity, as stated: 'By establishing these fare-free bus pilot routes, we are expanding access to public transportation across the city and improving transit equity to better serve all New Yorkers.' Advocates wanted all buses free, but the plan was scaled back in budget talks. The MTA will review impacts on ridership, service, and costs after six months.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Senate passed it, but Speaker Carl Heastie did not bring it to a vote in the Assembly, despite 60 co-sponsors and strong support from city lawmakers, Governor Hochul, and Mayor Adams. The bill, named for 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a speeding driver, would have allowed the city to lower most speed limits from 25 to 20 mph. Heastie cited concerns over e-bikes and speed bumps, saying, 'I'm not a dictator.' Advocates, including Sammy's mother Amy Cohen, condemned the move as 'Albany backroom politics at its worst.' The Department of Transportation called the bill vital for targeted street safety.

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a reckless driver in 2013, had majority support but stalled in the Assembly. Heastie’s office declined interviews and blamed the city Department of Transportation, claiming some members wanted more collaboration. The official statement read, 'Every community is different, and some members have significant concerns with moving forward with Sammy's Law at this time.' DOT countered that the law would give the city tools to protect lives. Neighbors and activists criticized Heastie’s inaction, warning that lives remain at risk while the city is denied the power to lower deadly speed limits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill—named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a van at age 12—would let New York City set its own speed limits, dropping the default to 20 mph and some streets to 10 mph. The Senate passed it 55-7, but the Assembly ended its June 22, 2023 session without a vote. Assembly sponsor Linda Rosenthal said, 'We just can't be deterred.' Senate sponsor Brad Hoylman-Sigal called the failure 'heartbreaking.' Speaker Carl Heastie refused to bring it to the floor. Advocates say the city’s hands are tied while deaths and injuries mount. The Council and Mayor Adams support the bill. For the third year, Albany blocks local control. Streets stay dangerous. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
