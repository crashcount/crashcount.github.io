On Monday, Aug. 11, two riders went down on the Bronx River Parkway. Police say a 2019 Mercedes tried to pass a 2015 Volkswagen near East 223rd Street. The car hit. The bikes fell. Both riders were thrown and later died at the hospital, identified as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, according to <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>NYPD <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/fatal-7-car-crash-on-bronx-river-parkway/>said</a>, &ldquo;Two men on motorcycles were killed in the crash overnight near East Gun Hill Road.&rdquo;</p><p>A sister stood in the courthouse. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just walking freely?

He was drunk,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>said</a> Clari Amarante Penalo.</p><p>The toll in CB12
In the last 12 months: 11 people killed and 12 seriously injured in CB12, across 1,153 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crashes</a>. This year to date: crashes up 11% and injuries up 23% versus last year to date, per the same <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>dataset</a>.</p><p>Names change; the pattern holds. Nov. 30, 2024: a 60-year-old man <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> while walking at Eastchester Rd and Givan Ave; factors include driver inattention and unsafe speed. Dec. 1, 2024: a 24-year-old cyclist <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> at E 233rd St and Webster Ave. May 24, 2025: a 76-year-old woman <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> while walking on White Plains Rd at E 216th St; driver inattention cited.</p><p>What leaders did — and didn’t
State Sen. Jamaal Bailey voted yes in June to move <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a>, a bill to require speed-limiters for repeat dangerous drivers. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie let NYC’s speed‑limit <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>bill</a> die without a vote in 2023. He also oversaw a major <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>red-light camera</a> expansion in 2024. Lawmakers <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/new-push-for-automated-ticketing-of-drivers-who-double-park-in-nyc>floated automated double-parking cameras</a> this year to keep lanes clear.</p><p>Credit for votes that save lives. No passes for delay that costs them.</p><p>What you can do now
Call Sen. Bailey and Speaker Heastie. Demand a floor vote on S4045. Back full deployment of red‑light and parking cameras. Push NYC DOT and NYPD to protect people outside cars on the Bronx River Parkway, White Plains Rd, and Webster Ave.</p><p>Do not look away. Two young men are dead. The next call could be yours.</p><p>Street safety in Bronx CB12 is central to Vision Zero. Prevent pedestrian injuries by pressing NYC DOT, NYPD, and the district’s council member to act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates rage. Sixteen groups demand OBTA money fix buses and trains, not bankroll toll rebates. Lawmakers ignore pleas. Millions outside Manhattan lose. Streets stay deadly. Transit riders wait. Cars win.</p><p class=mb3>On February 23, 2024, sixteen advocacy groups sent a letter to Governor Hochul, Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. They condemned the use of Outer Borough Transit Account (OBTA) funds for toll rebates instead of transit improvements. The OBTA, created in 2018 from a surcharge on Manhattan taxi and for-hire rides, was meant to boost transit service or lower fares outside Manhattan. Yet, $22.2 million has gone to toll rebates for drivers in the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. Only one transit project—the Far Rockaway City Ticket—has seen funding. Riders Alliance Director Danny Pearlstein said, “The Outer Borough Transit Account should clearly also help the millions of people outside Manhattan who don't have cars and who depend on public transit.” Lawmakers have not responded. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, train passengers, pedestrians—remain sidelined as car subsidies persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
