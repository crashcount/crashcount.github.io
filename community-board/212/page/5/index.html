She was 78. An SUV hit her. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.</a></p><p>A coach stood outside his home on Givan Avenue. A BMW and a pickup collided. The BMW spun, hit parked cars, hit the coach. He died. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last year, five people died on these streets. Seven hundred were hurt. Nine were left with injuries that change a life.</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Older New Yorkers and the young take the brunt.</strong> In the past 12 months, three people over 55 died. Sixty-one children were hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are mothers, fathers, neighbors, children. The street does not care. The cars do not stop.</p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. <strong>SUVs killed three. Cars and SUVs together left hundreds bleeding.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll, but the weight of steel is what crushes bones and ends breath.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Kevin Riley has co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks, scramble crosswalks, and better lighting. He voted to end jaywalking tickets and back solar crosswalks. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>No law has slowed the cars on White Plains Road. No new design has stopped the chain-reaction crashes on Givan Avenue.</strong></p><p>Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie helped <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>expand red light cameras</a>, but blocked the city from lowering speed limits for years. Only after years of delay did Albany <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>pass Sammy’s Law</a>. The streets waited. People died.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand street redesigns that protect people, not just cars. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

City lawmakers oppose a payroll tax hike limited to New York City. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie offers only vague assurances. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warns the capital plan is as vital as Medicare. Federal officials, including U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, criticize subway neglect and demand improvements before aid. Gov. Hochul’s office claims progress and urges fair federal funding. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The system’s decay puts riders at risk. The clock ticks.

They called the current funding unfair. The MTA moves millions, but federal dollars lag. Without repairs, riders face danger. The fight for transit cash grows urgent as deadlines loom.</p><p class=mb3>On March 25, 2025, Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins joined Gov. Hochul and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie in demanding increased federal funding for the MTA. Their letter to President Trump and congressional leaders argued, 'Mass transit must be federally funded at a level commensurate to its importance to our nation and New York must receive its fair share.' The officials seek $14 billion for the MTA’s 2025-2029 capital plan, citing a $30 billion gap and the system’s outsized national role. The request comes as federal transit money from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law nears expiration. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis opposed the request, citing MTA mismanagement. Federal Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy threatened to withhold funds over safety data and congestion pricing disputes. The bill is not a council measure but a coordinated state push, with Stewart-Cousins mentioned as a leading voice. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the lawmakers’ action highlights the stakes for millions of vulnerable transit riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
