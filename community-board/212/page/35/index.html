On Monday, Aug. 11, two riders went down on the Bronx River Parkway. Police say a 2019 Mercedes tried to pass a 2015 Volkswagen near East 223rd Street. The car hit. The bikes fell. Both riders were thrown and later died at the hospital, identified as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, according to <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>NYPD <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/fatal-7-car-crash-on-bronx-river-parkway/>said</a>, &ldquo;Two men on motorcycles were killed in the crash overnight near East Gun Hill Road.&rdquo;</p><p>A sister stood in the courthouse. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just walking freely?

He was drunk,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>said</a> Clari Amarante Penalo.</p><p>The toll in CB12
In the last 12 months: 11 people killed and 12 seriously injured in CB12, across 1,153 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crashes</a>. This year to date: crashes up 11% and injuries up 23% versus last year to date, per the same <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>dataset</a>.</p><p>Names change; the pattern holds. Nov. 30, 2024: a 60-year-old man <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> while walking at Eastchester Rd and Givan Ave; factors include driver inattention and unsafe speed. Dec. 1, 2024: a 24-year-old cyclist <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> at E 233rd St and Webster Ave. May 24, 2025: a 76-year-old woman <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> while walking on White Plains Rd at E 216th St; driver inattention cited.</p><p>What leaders did — and didn’t
State Sen. Jamaal Bailey voted yes in June to move <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a>, a bill to require speed-limiters for repeat dangerous drivers. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie let NYC’s speed‑limit <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>bill</a> die without a vote in 2023. He also oversaw a major <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>red-light camera</a> expansion in 2024. Lawmakers <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/new-push-for-automated-ticketing-of-drivers-who-double-park-in-nyc>floated automated double-parking cameras</a> this year to keep lanes clear.</p><p>Credit for votes that save lives. No passes for delay that costs them.</p><p>What you can do now
Call Sen. Bailey and Speaker Heastie. Demand a floor vote on S4045. Back full deployment of red‑light and parking cameras. Push NYC DOT and NYPD to protect people outside cars on the Bronx River Parkway, White Plains Rd, and Webster Ave.</p><p>Do not look away. Two young men are dead. The next call could be yours.</p><p>Street safety in Bronx CB12 is central to Vision Zero. Prevent pedestrian injuries by pressing NYC DOT, NYPD, and the district’s council member to act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He called out the agency for secrecy, not substance. The Bronx stretch is deadly. Dinowitz wants more transparency, not fewer lanes. The fight leaves vulnerable road users in limbo.</p><p class=mb3>On March 25, 2022, Councilmember Eric Dinowitz of District 11 made a public statement opposing the Department of Transportation’s proposed ‘road diet’ for Riverdale Avenue. The plan, aimed at a crash-prone Bronx corridor, was criticized by Dinowitz for a lack of transparency: 'A city agency should not be run this way.' He insisted he is not against the plan itself, but objects to DOT’s process, which bypassed him and Community Board 8. Dinowitz’s stance echoes his past opposition to bus lanes that reduce parking, though he supports bike lanes that do not remove vehicle lanes. The proposal, which includes a bike lane, remains under review. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided for this action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No new transit money. No tougher penalties. Riders left waiting. Drivers keep blocking. The city’s slowest buses stay slow. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 15, 2022, the New York State Assembly and Senate released one-house budget proposals. Both left out Governor Hochul’s measures to increase fines for blocking bus lanes, raise penalties for toll evasion and defaced plates, and boost transit funding. The matter: 'State legislators used their budget proposals to prioritize drivers blocking bus lanes and evading tolls, omitting Gov. Hochul's proposals to raise fines for blocking bus lanes and increase penalties for toll evasion and defaced license plates.' Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie defended stripping policy from the budget. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein slammed the move: 'No increase in subway or bus service for millions of riders, no enhanced enforcement in the city with the slowest buses in the country.' The Senate promised to revisit bus lane enforcement later. Advocates doubted action would follow. The legislature’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed, with no relief from blocked bus lanes or reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
