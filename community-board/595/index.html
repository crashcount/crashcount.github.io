The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing.

Mayor Eric Adams and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch oversaw the event, where a Sanitation Department bulldozer crushed the vehicles. Adams said, 'New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.' The city links these vehicles to traffic violations and crimes, including robberies and reckless riding. Since Adams took office, police have removed about 62,000 illegal vehicles, aiming to reduce hazards for pedestrians. NYPD data shows a 57% drop in moped-related crime in 2025.

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031.

The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season. The incident raises questions about internal discipline and the risks posed by impaired driving, even among law enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Diana I. Ayala is the primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors including De La Rosa, Banks, Ossé, Marte, and others. The bill was laid over by committee on February 10, 2025. The measure would take effect immediately if passed. By capping required coverage, the bill may leave crash victims with less compensation after collisions involving TLC-licensed vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brad Hoylman-Sigal (District 47) joined the debate over New York’s congestion pricing plan. The original $15 toll was paused by Governor Hochul in June. Now, officials consider a lower toll or alternatives to fund the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'we need congestion pricing.' The matter, titled 'MTA boss ‘thrilled’ Kathy Hochul eyeing lower congestion toll after NY gov indefinitely paused controversial scheme,' highlights the urgency of MTA financing. Assemblywoman Deborah Glick noted Hochul’s commitment to a replacement plan. The bill’s status remains in flux, with no committee or vote recorded. The safety impact for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—was not assessed. The city’s most at-risk remain exposed as leaders argue over dollars and cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
