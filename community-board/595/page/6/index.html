The proposal, discussed in the Assembly, faces suburban resistance. Carroll’s statement, titled "When It Comes to Transit, Everyone Must Pay Their Fair Share," argues that exempting suburbs would cost the MTA $325 million and undermine regional transit. Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the statement centers on funding the transit system that protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
