The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned.

Thousands of jobs vanish. Local companies lose out. Lawmakers in affected districts stay silent or cheer. Trains and buses face deep cuts. Riders, workers, and streets pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, Governor Hochul’s official pause on congestion pricing triggered a $12 billion loss in MTA contracts, according to a Reinvent Albany report. The move slashes funding for the 2020-24 MTA capital plan, which was to be partly paid by congestion pricing. The report highlights that many companies losing contracts are in districts represented by lawmakers who either support the pause or have stayed silent. Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick called congestion pricing 'simply another tax' and demanded repeal. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow praised the pause, saying it allows time to address 'communities' concerns.' Frank Russo, president of Ozone Park Lumber, warned, 'You can't just say, 'We're not going to buy supplies and equipment.'' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany said, 'Congestion pricing is an economic booster.' The pause means less money for transit, fewer jobs, and more risk for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, reliable public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The official title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to notice requirements for certain transportation projects and the repeal of section 19-187 in relation thereto.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of colleagues. The law repeals the old, separate bike lane notice process and folds it into the broader project notice rules. Now, after a set notice period and community feedback, the Department of Transportation can move ahead without delay.

The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
