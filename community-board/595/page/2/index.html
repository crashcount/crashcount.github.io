He died at the scene. Police listed driver distraction as a factor (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>2 people killed</strong> here since 2022. Another died on the Verrazano Bridge late on Aug 25, 2025. A 21‑year‑old motorcyclist was ejected and killed. Police cited unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). In that span, <strong>65 people were hurt</strong> on these CB95 streets (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=evening-blood-again-and-again>Evening blood, again and again</h3><p>Most harm lands at night.

Year to date, crashes in this community are up <strong>75%</strong> over last year, while deaths are unchanged at one and injuries are up <strong>50%</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern holds.</p><h3 id=two-corridors-keep-taking>Two corridors keep taking</h3><p>The deadliest spots in these records are <strong>Capodanno Boulevard</strong> and the <strong>Verrazano Bridge</strong>. Each saw a death in this period, with more injured nearby (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Capodanno at Lincoln, the man on foot died. On the bridge, the young rider never made it across. On Buffalo Street, a 63‑year‑old walking with the signal was hit by a turning sedan and seriously hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=slow-turns-clear-corners-night-enforcement>Slow turns. Clear corners. Night enforcement.</h3><p>What would help here is not theory. Hardened left turns where walkers cross. Daylighting at corners where drivers look too late.
