Streets risk more cars, more chaos. Vulnerable New Yorkers face louder, deadlier roads. The city’s shield cracks.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 4705, sponsored by Andrew J. Lanza (District 24), seeks to repeal congestion pricing. The bill, introduced on February 11, 2025, is at the sponsorship stage. The measure’s title is blunt: 'Repeals congestion pricing.' Lanza’s move would scrap a system designed to cut car traffic and crashes. No safety analyst has weighed in, but repealing congestion pricing means more cars, more risk, and more danger for people on foot and bike. The bill’s progress threatens hard-won protections for New York’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Farah N. Louis (primary) and co-sponsored by Brannan, Schulman, Banks, Farías, Carr, Ariola, and others, passed on March 15, 2025. The law demands annual reporting on compliance and reasons for any delay.

We believe that under these circumstances it is very warranted."" -- Andrew Lanza</p><p class=mb3>On January 8, 2025, Republican state legislators, including Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick (District 9), held a press conference demanding the resignation of Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair Janno Lieber. The lawmakers, joined by Senators Steven Rhoads and Bill Weber, criticized Lieber for 'losing the trust of commuters' and downplaying subway crime. They condemned the new $9 congestion pricing toll for Midtown, with Weber calling it 'tone deaf' and demanding repeal. The event summary reads: 'GOP pols push MTA boss to resign after brushing off transit crime as New York braces for even more taxes, fees.' The lawmakers oppose further taxes and fees to close the MTA’s $33 billion gap. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The debate leaves the city’s most exposed—pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders—uncertain and unprotected.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season. The incident raises questions about internal discipline and the risks posed by impaired driving, even among law enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
