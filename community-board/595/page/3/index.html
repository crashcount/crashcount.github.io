Streets stayed dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (March 15, 2025) reports two separate police-involved crashes. On Staten Island, officers responding to a gun call swerved to avoid a U-turning car, lost control, and crashed into a shuttered restaurant. Both officers were hospitalized with minor injuries. Hours earlier in Manhattan, a Dodge Charger changed lanes, clipped a street sweeper, spun out, and pinned an officer against his patrol SUV. Surveillance footage showed the Charger 'spinning out of control before hitting the officer.' Witness Abi Aguirre described the chaos: 'It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car.' Both incidents highlight the risks posed by high-speed responses and sudden driver maneuvers. Storefronts and sidewalks offered little protection. No pedestrians were reported injured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
