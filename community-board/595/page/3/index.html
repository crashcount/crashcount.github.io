The proposal, discussed in the Assembly, faces suburban resistance. Carroll’s statement, titled "When It Comes to Transit, Everyone Must Pay Their Fair Share," argues that exempting suburbs would cost the MTA $325 million and undermine regional transit. Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the statement centers on funding the transit system that protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law was introduced on October 27, 2022, passed on May 29, 2023, and returned unsigned by the mayor. The bill amends the administrative code to require the Department of Transportation to conduct a comprehensive study of all pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries every three years, instead of every five. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian safety reporting.' Sponsors include Alexa Avilés (primary), Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Crystal Hudson, Amanda Farías, Tiffany Cabán, Lynn C. Schulman, Kalman Yeger, Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, Darlene Mealy, Eric Dinowitz, Linda Lee, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Carlina Rivera, Mercedes Narcisse, and Rita C. Joseph. The law mandates that crash reports and recommendations be sent to council members, community boards, and made public. This change increases transparency and keeps the focus on the deadly toll of cars in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
