Another died on the Verrazano Bridge late on Aug 25, 2025. A 21‑year‑old motorcyclist was ejected and killed. Police cited unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

On Capodanno at Lincoln, the man on foot died. On the bridge, the young rider never made it across. On Buffalo Street, a 63‑year‑old walking with the signal was hit by a turning sedan and seriously hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=slow-turns-clear-corners-night-enforcement>Slow turns.

The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2024, Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (District 49) stood with Staten Island officials at a press conference to oppose New York’s congestion pricing plan. The event, covered by nypost.com, highlighted concerns that the $15 toll for driving south of 60th Street in Manhattan would, as Hanks said, 'have a negative impact in neighborhoods of color in the outer boroughs.' Hanks and others argued the plan would burden working residents and increase pollution in Staten Island’s minority communities. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s environmental assessment confirmed air quality could worsen in Staten Island, the Bronx, and New Jersey, even as it improves in Manhattan. The MTA pledged $130 million for clean-up, but local leaders remain unconvinced. Hanks’s opposition underscores the ongoing debate over who pays—and who suffers—when the city tries to curb car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They claim the toll shifts pollution, burdens drivers, and fails communities with poor transit. The MTA defends the plan, saying it funds safer, less crowded streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 4, 2024, Council Member Joseph C. Borelli (District 51) joined seventeen other lawmakers in a federal lawsuit to block New York City’s $15 congestion pricing toll for Midtown Manhattan. The suit, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, argues the toll 'is a detriment to those that will be affected by this toll, environmentally and financially,' and claims it will shift traffic and pollution to other neighborhoods. Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin. The MTA, backed by Governor Hochul, says the toll will raise $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades, promising safer, less congested streets and better transit for the majority who rely on public transportation.

Lanza of District 24, seeks to repeal congestion pricing. Introduced on January 9, 2024, the bill is at the sponsorship stage. The measure's title is blunt: 'Repeals congestion pricing.' Lanza stands as the primary sponsor. If passed, this repeal would remove a policy designed to limit car traffic in crowded city streets. No safety analyst has yet weighed in, but the move threatens to flood roads with more vehicles, putting pedestrians and cyclists in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the man stepped into the street where there was 'no light, no crosswalk.' A northbound Mercedes SUV struck him head-on. The pedestrian suffered head trauma and internal bleeding and died at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor in the crash. The SUV's point of impact was the center front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report notes the pedestrian was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' but lists driver inattention as the primary cause. The deadly outcome unfolded on a street lacking basic pedestrian infrastructure, with driver error at its core.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The study, led by HDR, will look at expanding the bridge’s narrow lanes to meet federal standards and possibly adding more lanes. The matter summary states the goal is to 'relieve congestion and improve traffic flow.' State Senator Andrew Lanza pushed for the study, calling the bridge 'very narrow therefore very dangerous.' Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton acknowledged induced demand and said the study will consider all options, including a shared-use path for cyclists and pedestrians. Former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz opposed widening, urging investment in public transit instead. The study’s outcome could shape the future safety of vulnerable road users crossing between Staten Island and New Jersey.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
