Metal hits metal. The cause is always the same: someone too close, someone not looking, someone in a hurry. The road is a machine that does not care.</p><p>No pedestrians killed. No cyclists killed.

The state passes laws. Speed cameras, lower limits, new rules. But here, the grind goes on. <strong>No bold local action. No public stand. No new protections for the most vulnerable.</strong></p><p>The silence is loud. The numbers do not lie. The road is not safe, only lucky. Luck runs out.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits.

The group wrote to MTA chairman Janno Lieber, stating, "Express buses play a vital role in Queens’ public transit network and only stand to become even more pivotal in the near and distant future." They criticized the MTA for boosting express bus service in Brooklyn and Staten Island but not Queens, calling the exclusion "unacceptable." The lawmakers stressed that many southeast and northeast Queens residents lack subway access and rely on express buses to reach Midtown. They argued the 10 percent LIRR discount is no substitute for robust bus service.
