Council Member Lincoln Restler is the primary sponsor, joined by Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, and Francisco P. Moya. Their action: sponsorship and referral to committee.

The bill required agencies to notify council members, community boards, and business districts before removing a traffic lane or parking for 500 feet or three blocks for at least a week. The matter summary reads: 'providing notice and an opportunity for comment before implementing a major traffic change.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor), Francisco P. Moya, Sandra Ung, and Pierina Ana Sanchez backed the bill. It was filed at the end of session, never enacted. The bill would have given local officials ten days to respond to proposed changes, but exempted urgent safety actions. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s fate leaves the status quo: agencies can still act without local input.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to amend the city code to 'establish a reward for individuals who provide information leading to the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person who seriously injures or kills another individual in a hit-and-run accident.' Council Member Rita C. Joseph sponsored the bill, joined by sixteen co-sponsors including Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, and others. The bill would have authorized up to $1,000 for information leading to the capture of hit-and-run drivers, but excluded law enforcement and city employees from eligibility. The measure was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. With the bill's failure, the city offers no extra incentive to help catch drivers who leave victims bleeding in the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would have shifted some sidewalk responsibility away from private owners, but left gaps in accountability. The city retains liability for areas beyond the thirty-foot limit, but the fractured system remains. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, wheelchair users—still face hazards from uneven, neglected sidewalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The session followed Governor Hochul’s cancellation of the Willets Point AirTrain. The event, covered by the media and led by a panel including Janette Sadik-Khan, drew strong opinions. The matter summary: 'In Astoria, Queens, 14 possible transit options for connecting to LaGuardia Airport were presented at a public comment session.' Council Member Larinda Hooks (District 35) voiced support for the original AirTrain, ferry service, and other mass transit options, but opposed removing parking or traffic lanes. Hooks said, 'The original plan is still the best plan... It doesn’t go near anybody’s house.' The process continues. No final plan.
