Metal hits metal. The cause is always the same: someone too close, someone not looking, someone in a hurry. The road is a machine that does not care.</p><p>No pedestrians killed. No cyclists killed.

The state passes laws. Speed cameras, lower limits, new rules. But here, the grind goes on. <strong>No bold local action. No public stand. No new protections for the most vulnerable.</strong></p><p>The silence is loud. The numbers do not lie. The road is not safe, only lucky. Luck runs out.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits.
