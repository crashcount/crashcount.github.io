Violators face civil penalties up to $50. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Council Members Holden, Vernikov, Narcisse, Moya, Schulman, Louis, Hanks, Brannan, and Zhuang.

The article states, "the routes to ride a Citi Bike to Citi Field remain too full of question marks... too full of holes to say the job is complete." Council Member Francisco Moya attended the unveiling, praising Mets owner Steve Cohen for the new bike share stations. Yet, Moya has a record of opposing local bike and bus lanes, including efforts to block a bike lane on 111th Street and a bus lane on Northern Boulevard. Advocates and community members, including Jim Burke, welcomed the bike share but warned that dangerous gaps persist. Cyclists must still brave hazardous crossings, especially at highway ramps without signals. With new development planned, the city faces mounting pressure to fix these deadly connections and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
