Kids in backseats, elders by the curb, all paying for City Hall’s delays. Demand 20 mph limits now, before one more life is lost. Speak up or watch the toll rise.</p><h3 id=the-toll-injuries-stack-up-no-one-spared>The Toll: Injuries Stack Up, No One Spared</h3><p>In Queens CB80, the numbers do not lie. No one has died in a crash here since 2022. But seventy people have been injured. Children, elders, workers—no one is immune. In the last year alone, twenty-four more were hurt. The pain is spread across ages: a 6-year-old with whiplash, a 55-year-old woman in the front seat, a 4-year-old in the back, all in the same crash on the Grand Central Parkway. The cause: &ldquo;Following Too Closely&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to city data</a>.</p><p>On May 13, a 44-year-old man was injured when two sedans collided on Marine Terminal Road. The record says &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction.&rdquo; The result: whiplash, another life changed. The pattern repeats. The road does not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-cast-but-is-it-enough>Leadership: Votes Cast, But Is It Enough?</h3><p>Local leaders have not been silent. Senator Toby Stavisky <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to curb repeat dangerous drivers. Assembly Member Larinda Hooks voted to extend school speed zones—a move to protect children where they are most exposed. Council Member Francisco Moya has backed bills for street safety transparency and better pavement markings. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost-no-accident-just-neglect>The Human Cost: No Accident, Just Neglect</h3><p>&ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said Jacqueline Cox</a> after a Q20 bus jumped the curb in Flushing, injuring seven. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb,&rdquo; but video showed he <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>&ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel&rdquo;</a>. Eight people hurt. A pole down. A ticket machine smashed. The MTA pulled the driver from service. The investigation drags on.</p><p>These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by city hall, by Albany.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>Contact your council member, your senator, your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear.</p><p>The numbers are bodies. The policies are choices. The time for patience is over.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
