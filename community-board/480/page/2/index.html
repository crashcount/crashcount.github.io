Pena was arrested at the scene and charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusing a breath test. The FDNY suspended Pena without pay. Two Mercedes passengers were hospitalized. The article quotes a local shop owner: "It was terrible." The crash highlights the lethal risk of red-light running and impaired driving at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
