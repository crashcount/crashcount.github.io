The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s promise, still unkept.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 22, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams has failed to deliver on his promise to install hundreds of secure bike parking lockers across New York City. The Department of Transportation has not selected a vendor, despite plans to add 500 secure spots by next month. Councilmembers urged action, calling the program potentially 'as transformative and impactful as our (Citi Bike) share program.' Jon Orcutt of Bike New York said, 'The Adams administration seems to be flubbing it, or failing it, or just letting it sort of slide through the cracks.' The delay leaves cyclists, especially delivery workers, exposed to theft and lacking safe storage. The city’s inaction stands in contrast to London, where secure bike parking has boosted cycling rates. Policy inertia and slow procurement keep New Yorkers vulnerable and city streets less safe for those on two wheels.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

TLC Commissioner David Do said, “We made that today. It is the most accessible fleet in the entire country.” This achievement follows a decade-long push by disability advocates and a 2013 settlement requiring half the medallion fleet to be accessible. The transition faced delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic and medallion owner financial struggles. Policy changes, such as alternating accessible vehicles and funding support, drove the shift.

The plan, discussed at a community board meeting, would have barred cyclists from Beach 108th to Beach 73rd Street during summer months. Council Member Joann Ariola, representing District 32, expressed relief at the reversal, stating, 'I’m glad that the Parks Department is going to continue allowing Rockaway residents to enjoy their bikes on the boardwalk this summer, but now we need real enforcement.' Instead of a ban, the Parks Department will increase signage and enforcement, especially near concessions. The community board voted 30-1 for new signs and called for marked bike lanes, an 8 mph speed limit, and clearer right-of-way rules.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On May 6, 2025, the NYPD’s new policy of issuing criminal court summonses to cyclists and e-bike riders for low-level traffic offenses drew sharp criticism. The policy, backed by Mayor Adams and Police Commissioner Tisch, claims to target 'quality of life' offenses. Cyclists report tickets for minor or fabricated infractions, including headphone use and stopping ahead of painted lines. Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander called the crackdown 'performative,' urging alternatives like the Idaho Stop and stricter delivery app regulation. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the need for criminal court involvement and signaled interest in a hearing. The article notes e-bike riders cause few pedestrian injuries. The City Council previously limited criminal summonses for minor infractions over racial profiling concerns. Critics say the crackdown punishes vulnerable road users while failing to improve street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, supported by Mayor Adams and Police Commissioner Tisch, escalates minor cycling infractions to criminal court summonses. The article, titled 'As NYPD’s Criminal Crackdown on Cyclists Expands, It Grows More Absurd: Victims,' details complaints of overzealous, inconsistent enforcement and alleged entrapment. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the need for criminal court involvement, while Comptroller Brad Lander called the crackdown 'performative' and dangerous. The safety analyst notes: 'Policies that empower discretionary or punitive enforcement against cyclists can deter active transportation, increase fear and mistrust, and shift responsibility away from systemic safety improvements, ultimately undermining population-level safety for vulnerable road users.' The crackdown draws widespread criticism for endangering those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street remembers the impact.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on May 2, 2025, that Michael Peña, a former FDNY probationary firefighter, was released on $75,000 bail after a deadly Queens crash. Police allege Peña was 'drunk and high on cocaine and marijuana' and speeding at 83 mph when he 'ran a red light and T-boned a car driven by 24-year-old Justin Diaz.' The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions. Peña faces manslaughter and other charges, with a possible 15-year sentence if convicted. The case highlights the lethal risk of impaired, reckless driving and the limits of pretrial detention policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
