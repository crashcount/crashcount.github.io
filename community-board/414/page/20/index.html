Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, children, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at night. They are the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last week, two NYPD cruisers collided in Edgemere while racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital. The news called it a crash, but it could have been worse. No bystanders died this time. Two police cruisers <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>collided while responding to a call in the Rockaways</a>.

Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. But the injuries add up. Cars and trucks caused <strong>244 injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Bikes, four. Each number is a broken body, a life changed.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, <strong>42 people under 18 were hurt</strong>. One was killed. The old are not spared either. Eleven people over 75 were injured. One sharp turn, one missed stop, and a life is gone.</p><h2 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h2><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some do not.</strong> State Senator James Sanders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children.

The silence is loud.</p><p>Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>called for more daylight at intersections</a>, co-sponsoring a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. She said, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.

Officials dodged questions. Council grilled DOT. Advocates tracked the shortfall. Political meddling blocks safer streets. Vulnerable New Yorkers wait. Progress stalls. Danger stays.</p><p class=mb3>On September 13, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on the Department of Transportation’s progress toward mandated bus and bike lane construction. The hearing, led by Transportation Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for answers. The law requires 150 miles of protected bus lanes and 250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026. In 2022, the city built only 4.4 miles of bus lanes and 26.3 miles of bike lanes, far short of the legal benchmarks. Councilmember Lincoln Restler criticized political interference, saying, 'We're at a point where it's all politics all the time, and we're failing to execute.' Advocacy groups confirmed the city lags behind. The administration’s refusal to track or disclose progress leaves vulnerable road users exposed. The city’s failure to act keeps streets dangerous.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT leaders dodged numbers, citing delays and staff shortages. The hearing exposed deep rifts over accountability. Vulnerable road users wait as city agencies stall and argue.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2023, the City Council Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, held an oversight hearing on the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) compliance with the Streets Master Plan under Local Law 195. Brooks-Powers demanded specifics: 'DOT has struggled to meet its legal mandate. In 2021, DOT installed just 4.4 miles of bus lane—well below 20-mile requirement.' DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton and Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, refused to provide current figures, promising data next year. Brooks-Powers called this 'unacceptable.' She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency. Staffing shortages and council opposition to projects were cited as obstacles. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler demands swift action: real protected bike lanes, not empty promises.</p><p class=mb3>On September 11, 2023, Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) issued a statement on street safety and protected bike lanes. The data, compiled by Transportation Alternatives, showed his Brooklyn district suffered the most traffic injuries citywide in the first half of 2023: 36 pedestrians, 24 cyclists, and 41 motorists. The matter summary reads, 'New York City is on pace for one of the deadliest years for bike riders in recent history, but it doesn't have to be this way.' Restler called on the Adams administration to 'prioritize and expedite proven solutions that will save lives, especially the swift implementation of a truly protected network of bike lanes.' The statement underscores the urgent need for systemic change as vulnerable road users bear the brunt of failed policy and dangerous streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They demanded new rail and park space for Queens. Elected officials and advocates pressed the MTA to act. The agency stalled, citing costs. Supporters want transit, green space, and bike paths. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On September 7, 2023, QueensLink supporters rallied at City Hall, pushing for the reactivation of an old rail line between southeast and central Queens. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted the proposal's promise: 'both new train service and park land.' State Sen. James Sanders led the call, declaring, 'Yes, we want a park and yes we want a light rail. We can have both.' Mike Scala, another advocate, stressed public support for a combined approach. The QueensLink faces competition from the QueensWay, a park-only plan with $35 million in city funding. The MTA has not committed, citing high costs and ongoing needs assessment. No formal council bill or committee action is recorded yet. Supporters remain determined to see transit, park space, and bike paths included in future city plans.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city weighs safety against fairness in street crossings.</p><p class=mb3>On July 22, 2023, Councilwoman Mercedes Narcisse introduced a bill to legalize jaywalking in New York City. The measure, supported by Council Members Tiffany Caban and Shahana Hanif, aims to 'greenlight pedestrians to freely cross streets outside the crosswalk or without obeying traffic signals.' The bill responds to claims of biased enforcement against Black and Latino New Yorkers. Council Majority Leader Joseph Borelli and Councilwoman Joann Ariola oppose the bill, warning it could endanger pedestrians. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or received a hearing. The NYPD and Mayor's office are reviewing the legislation. The debate highlights the tension between enforcement fairness and the ongoing risk to vulnerable road users.

Limited view contributed to the crash.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a motor scooter changing lanes collided with a southbound SUV traveling straight on Central Avenue. The scooter driver, a 36-year-old male wearing a helmet, sustained contusions and injuries to his knee and lower leg. The report lists 'View Obstructed/Limited' as a contributing factor twice, indicating poor visibility played a key role. The SUV was impacted on its right front quarter panel, while the scooter struck with its left front bumper. The scooter driver was conscious and not ejected. No other driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding were noted. The crash highlights the dangers posed by limited sight lines during lane changes in mixed traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
