The goal is simple: safer steps.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0875-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced May 16, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to install pedestrian lighting on at least 25 step streets each year. The bill’s matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends. The measure targets a clear hazard: darkness on city stairs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They say MTA left Queens behind. Riders in transit deserts face long, costly trips. Lawmakers call the exclusion unacceptable. They want fair service before new fees begin.</p><p class=mb3>On May 16, 2024, ten Queens lawmakers, including Julia Salazar (District 18), urged the MTA to expand express bus service to Queens before the $15 Manhattan congestion toll starts. The group wrote to MTA chairman Janno Lieber, stating, "Express buses play a vital role in Queens’ public transit network and only stand to become even more pivotal in the near and distant future." They criticized the MTA for boosting express bus service in Brooklyn and Staten Island but not Queens, calling the exclusion "unacceptable." The lawmakers stressed that many southeast and northeast Queens residents lack subway access and rely on express buses to reach Midtown. They argued the 10 percent LIRR discount is no substitute for robust bus service. Salazar and her colleagues support congestion pricing but insist its success depends on expanded, equitable transit for all vulnerable riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Beaton testified, 'Half of our vehicles are stored on the street overnight.' The Adams administration aims to install up to 10,000 curbside chargers over the next decade. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized DOT for failing to meet bus and bike lane expansion mandates. Sara Lind of Open Plans countered, 'DOT and the administration are fully capable of changing the status quo and rethinking curb parking.' Advocates warned that more EV chargers could block future sidewalk, bike lane, or outdoor dining expansions.

The Council and DOT hold the power. Advocates say language matters. Streets remain deadly. Action lags. Lives hang in balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 8, 2024, Mayor Eric Adams publicly supported lowering speed limits after the passage of 'Sammy’s Law,' which allows New York City to reduce limits to 20 mph on most roads. The law, passed in the state budget, excludes wide, multi-lane roads in the outer boroughs. Adams said, 'I do believe as New Yorkers we need to slow down,' but repeatedly referred to preventable crashes as 'accidents,' a term advocates reject for removing driver responsibility. The City Council must legislate any citywide speed limit change, while the Department of Transportation (DOT) can adjust limits on specific streets after community input. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Speaker Adrienne Adams pledged to 'collaborate and negotiate' with City Hall. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi stressed the need for street redesign and legal reform, noting, 'This is not a problem that goes away on its own.' Despite new authority, the Adams administration has lagged on safe street infrastructure. The city faces its deadliest start to a year in the Vision Zero era, with 60 killed in the first quarter.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, long blocked by Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, finally moved forward under Governor Kathy Hochul’s push. The measure, described as 'a significant legislative achievement,' excludes roads outside Manhattan with three or more travel lanes in one direction—a concession to car-centric lawmakers. The law requires community board notification and comment, but their input is only advisory. Families of road violence victims and street safety advocates celebrated the win. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, Transportation Chair, conditioned her support on street redesigns in underserved neighborhoods. The law’s carve-out leaves many of the city’s deadliest roads unchanged, withholding proven safety benefits from major thoroughfares.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger drops for those on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 0857-2024, now laid over in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced April 18, 2024. The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to towing vehicles that are an encumbrance on the street.' It requires the Department of Sanitation to remove vehicles blocking the street within 72 hours of notice. The NYPD must tow cars with missing, obscured, or improper plates and stickers. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Salamanca, Brannan, Feliz, Ayala, Louis, Brewer, Avilés, Mealy, Ung, Restler, Farías, Hudson, Riley, and Schulman. The bill targets vehicles that endanger pedestrians and cyclists by blocking sightlines and crossings. It aims to clear hazards fast, making streets safer for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents and officials voice anger and frustration.</p><p class=mb3>""In our effort to reduce congestion in the central business district, we’re going to allow increased congestion in our neighborhoods, in our communities?"" -- Khaleel Anderson</p><p class=mb3>On April 6, 2024, Councilman Robert F. Holden (District 30) criticized New York City’s congestion pricing plan, which will charge drivers $15 to enter below 60th Street. The matter, titled 'NYC’s Upper West Side already becoming commuter parking lot for congestion-pricing evaders,' highlights growing concern that the plan will shift traffic and pollution to neighborhoods like the Upper West Side, Kew Gardens, Staten Island, and Brooklyn. Holden said, 'You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out: if you are going to charge people $15 to go below 60th, those people will look for alternatives.' Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, a supporter, admitted, 'It’s going to get worse once there’s a charge at 60th Street—no doubt about it.' Councilwoman Lynn Shulman backs a residential permit parking pilot to address spillover. Community leaders say residents were not consulted.

They claimed community harm, ignoring hard data. Bike lanes and safer streets faced political fire. DOT stood firm, citing lives saved and broad support. Vulnerable road users caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on DOT street safety projects and Streets Plan implementation. The hearing, led by Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), Christopher Banks (D-Brooklyn), and Rafael Salamanca Jr. (D-Bronx), focused on the DOT's progress under the Streets Plan, which mandates annual targets for protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns. DOT officials defended their process, emphasizing community engagement and prioritizing high-need areas. The council's opposition stands in stark contrast to the projects' proven safety benefits for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
