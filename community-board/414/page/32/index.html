Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, children, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at night. They are the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last week, two NYPD cruisers collided in Edgemere while racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital. The news called it a crash, but it could have been worse. No bystanders died this time. Two police cruisers <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>collided while responding to a call in the Rockaways</a>.

Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. But the injuries add up. Cars and trucks caused <strong>244 injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Bikes, four. Each number is a broken body, a life changed.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, <strong>42 people under 18 were hurt</strong>. One was killed. The old are not spared either. Eleven people over 75 were injured. One sharp turn, one missed stop, and a life is gone.</p><h2 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h2><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some do not.</strong> State Senator James Sanders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children.

The silence is loud.</p><p>Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>called for more daylight at intersections</a>, co-sponsoring a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. She said, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.

The violations occurred between May 2020 and April 2022. Brooks-Powers represents Southeast Queens, an area plagued by pedestrian and motorist fatalities. The matter surfaced in April 2022, with Brooks-Powers admitting responsibility for most tickets. She stated, 'public safety is very important to me,' and pledged to improve. Under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, she must complete a safety course or risk car impoundment. Her tickets have been paid, so her car was not towed. Camera tickets do not affect her license. Brooks-Powers says she is working with advocates to address traffic violence and congestion, but her record highlights the ongoing danger for vulnerable road users in her district.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, passed in 2019, aims for 250 protected bike lanes and 150 bus lanes. The Council wants to double these targets: 500 miles each of protected bike and bus lanes, plus 38 million square feet of new pedestrian plazas. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said the goal is 'to make our thoroughfares safer and more accessible, while increasing New York's pedestrian plazas footprint.' The Council’s proposal comes as the mayor’s $98.5-billion budget lacks dedicated funding for these safety upgrades. Advocates for bus and bike infrastructure support the Council’s push. The mayor says he is reviewing the proposal and remains committed to street safety and transit improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Of course, there's a lot more community input, but there's no such thing as a perfect plan and we should not let perfect be the enemy of good as well."" -- Donovan J. Richards</p><p class=mb3>On March 30, 2022, the MTA released a second draft of its Queens bus network redesign. The plan, not tied to a bill number, is a policy proposal under review. It follows backlash to the 2019 draft and pandemic delays. The redesign boosts routes from 77 to 85, adds 20 new lines, and drops the revenue-neutral rule. Hundreds of stops will be cut to speed service. The MTA and NYC DOT picked 49 corridors for upgrades like bus lanes. The official summary states the plan 'incorporates feedback from over 11,000 customer comments and aims to address previous criticisms.' MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'We know we need to get it right this time.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and advocates like Riders Alliance back the effort but call for more equity and engagement.

The matter summary: 'In Astoria, Queens, 14 possible transit options for connecting to LaGuardia Airport were presented at a public comment session.' Council Member Larinda Hooks (District 35) voiced support for the original AirTrain, ferry service, and other mass transit options, but opposed removing parking or traffic lanes.

The law aims to bypass restrictive federal guidelines that block safety fixes. Council members and residents blasted DOT for slow, arbitrary action and years of denied requests, sometimes only reversed after tragedy.

The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the Bus Turnaround coalition's renewed push for dedicated busways, more bus lanes, and increased funding. Restler said, 'We need a real busway on Jay Street,' citing rampant illegal driving and slow service. The rally criticized City Hall for ambitious targets but no concrete plans. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez promised 150 new miles of bus lanes, but advocates noted delays and lack of enforcement. The recommendations aim to speed up buses for vulnerable riders—working-class, immigrant, and communities of color—who rely on slow, unreliable service. The rally underscored the urgent need for action to protect and prioritize those most at risk on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Adams administration had promised to harden 20 miles of bike lanes within its first 100 days. Now, DOT says the work will finish by the end of 2023. The first phase covers just 5.5 miles in Manhattan and Queens. DOT Commissioner Rodriguez said, “We have an actionable, concrete plan to protect cyclists and we are going to deliver on this work to keep our lanes clear.” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the upgrades, calling for safe biking citywide. Community Board 3’s Michelle Kuppersmith highlighted the need for political will. Still, the delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as the city also postponed pedestrian space on the Queensboro Bridge. The slow rollout means danger lingers for cyclists and walkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, not tied to a specific bill, reviewed automated enforcement and street design. It found speed cameras are evenly distributed and reduce crashes, but dangerous road design still puts lives at risk. Adams and other leaders called for more cameras and urgent street redesigns, echoing the article’s summary: 'Cameras have led to fewer crashes, injuries, and fatalities, but high numbers of tickets in some neighborhoods are attributed to unsafe road design, not camera placement.' Community voices stressed that automated enforcement helps, but cannot replace permanent fixes to deadly streets. The Department of Transportation’s lack of transparency on camera locations remains a concern.
