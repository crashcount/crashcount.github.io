Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, children, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at night. They are the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last week, two NYPD cruisers collided in Edgemere while racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital. The news called it a crash, but it could have been worse. No bystanders died this time. Two police cruisers <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>collided while responding to a call in the Rockaways</a>.

Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. But the injuries add up. Cars and trucks caused <strong>244 injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Bikes, four. Each number is a broken body, a life changed.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, <strong>42 people under 18 were hurt</strong>. One was killed. The old are not spared either. Eleven people over 75 were injured. One sharp turn, one missed stop, and a life is gone.</p><h2 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h2><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some do not.</strong> State Senator James Sanders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children.

The silence is loud.</p><p>Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>called for more daylight at intersections</a>, co-sponsoring a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. She said, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.

The first phase includes $5 million for environmental review and $30 million for the Metropolitan Hub. The matter summary states: 'converting a defunct LIRR branch into a Highline-style park in Queens.' Council Member Lynn Schulman supports the park, calling it 'shovel-ready.' Borough President Donovan Richards and Assembly Members Jenifer Rajkumar and David Weprin back both the park and the QueensLink transit proposal. Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation. The debate continues over whether the right-of-way should serve parks, transit, or both.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary: 'expanding New York's speed camera program.' Council Member Joann Ariola, representing southern Queens and the Rockaways, voted no. Ariola argued, 'these cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,' and claimed repeat offenders with fake plates escape punishment. Ariola’s SUV has 48 violations since 2017, including 27 for speeding in school zones and two for running red lights. She insists her record did not influence her vote. Critics, like StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure, highlight the contradiction between her opposition to speed cameras and her stated concern for school safety. The vote denied a proven measure to slow traffic and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT will add a parking-protected bike lane and more space for people on foot. The redesign aims to slow drivers and shield those outside cars from harm.</p><p class=mb3>On September 6, 2022, the Department of Transportation announced a major safety redesign for Seagirt Boulevard, a notorious crash corridor in Far Rockaway. The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.' The redesign targets a stretch with 222 crashes and 87 injuries since 2019, aiming to end the long-standing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
