A child rides home from school. In Queens CB14, these simple acts can end in blood. <strong>Since 2022, 11 people have died and 1,127 have been injured in crashes here</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>). The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. <strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, motorcycles, and even bikes add to the toll.

A baby, killed on the North Channel Bridge. A 52-year-old woman, gone on Beach Channel Drive. <strong>In the last 12 months alone, 352 people were hurt and one killed.</strong> Children are not spared. Forty-one under 18 were injured.

Assembly Member <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">Stacey Pheffer Amato co-sponsored bills</a> for safer roads. But these are words on paper. The street waits for action, not promises.</p><p><strong>Some leaders have worked against progress.</strong> Pheffer Amato <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/16/watchdog-group-no-toll-exemptions-for-cops>backed a bill</a> to give NYPD officers a break from congestion pricing. That means less money for transit, more cars, and more danger for those on foot or bike. <strong>When leaders delay or dodge, people die.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Residents must demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to fund street redesigns, enforce speed limits, and protect the most vulnerable. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Restler vows to push hard for passage, saying, 'This bill would make a tremendous difference in making our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.' The bill’s fate is uncertain after Restler’s removal from the Transportation Committee, but the intent is clear: shift enforcement from NYPD to the people, and clear the way for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, titled "NYC streets have gotten safer under Vision Zero – especially if you live in a white neighborhood," found that while traffic fatalities dropped citywide, majority-Black communities saw a 13% increase and Latino areas a 30% rise. Brooks-Powers said, "It is deeply concerning that communities of color are experiencing fatalities at higher rates." The report states, "It's clear the program has not been fully or effectively implemented in neighborhoods of color and with lower incomes." DOT spokesperson Anna Correa responded that recent plans focus more resources on high-poverty, non-white neighborhoods, but the safety gap persists.

A 42-year-old female driver of a 2020 Nissan SUV traveling east collided with a 2015 Mitsubishi sedan making a right turn northbound. The point of impact was the center front end of the SUV and the left front bumper of the sedan. The SUV driver was injured with fractures, dislocations, and abdomen-pelvis trauma, trapped inside her vehicle despite wearing a lap belt and harness. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors for the SUV driver. Both vehicles sustained front-end damage. The sedan had three occupants, and its male driver was licensed in New York.

Clarkston, Georgia, with high traffic-fatality rates, won $1 million from the Safe Streets and Roads for All grant to craft a safety plan. The Local Infrastructure Hub, co-led by Bloomberg Philanthropies, provides technical help, boosting applications. Mayor Beverley Burks of Clarkston said, "You have to be willing to invest in yourself as a city... Having someone who had the skillset to be able to help write the narrative – that’s very crucial for the reviewers to understand the needs in your community." James Anderson, also quoted, highlighted how technical assistance turns ambition into real safety. Other small cities, like Globe, Arizona, and Gladewater, Texas, have also won grants for pedestrian safety. These wins show federal money can reach vulnerable road users in overlooked places.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On January 12, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported on the failure of new concrete barriers meant to protect bike lanes on Park Avenue in the Bronx. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This was the second year of missed targets since the law’s 2019 passage. The plan, created by then-Council Speaker Corey Johnson, aimed to make streets safer and more equitable. Key projects—like McGuinness Boulevard bike lanes and Fordham Road bus lanes—were delayed or canceled. The Department of Transportation blamed staff shortages and budget cuts. Transportation Committee Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' She also criticized the DOT’s lack of transparency. Speaker Adrienne Adams joined calls for compliance but admitted the Council’s enforcement tools are limited.
