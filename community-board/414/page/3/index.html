A 1972 Pontiac sedan behind it, also traveling west, collided with the Nissan's center back end. The Pontiac driver was stopped in traffic. The Nissan driver, a 19-year-old male with a permit license, was cited for driver inattention/distraction and following too closely. Both drivers were conscious and wearing lap belts and harnesses. The 53-year-old Pontiac driver suffered neck injuries and whiplash, while the Nissan driver sustained hip and upper leg injuries and whiplash. Neither occupant was ejected.
