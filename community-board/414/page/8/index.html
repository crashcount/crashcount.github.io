A child rides home from school. In Queens CB14, these simple acts can end in blood. <strong>Since 2022, 11 people have died and 1,127 have been injured in crashes here</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>). The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. <strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, motorcycles, and even bikes add to the toll.

A baby, killed on the North Channel Bridge. A 52-year-old woman, gone on Beach Channel Drive. <strong>In the last 12 months alone, 352 people were hurt and one killed.</strong> Children are not spared. Forty-one under 18 were injured.

Assembly Member <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">Stacey Pheffer Amato co-sponsored bills</a> for safer roads. But these are words on paper. The street waits for action, not promises.</p><p><strong>Some leaders have worked against progress.</strong> Pheffer Amato <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/16/watchdog-group-no-toll-exemptions-for-cops>backed a bill</a> to give NYPD officers a break from congestion pricing. That means less money for transit, more cars, and more danger for those on foot or bike. <strong>When leaders delay or dodge, people die.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Residents must demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to fund street redesigns, enforce speed limits, and protect the most vulnerable. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas.

Announced September 11, 2024, the $24.8 million project includes protected bike lanes, expanded sidewalks, and safer crossings. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards pledged $500,000, saying, "We're not waiting until someone loses their life to take action." Since 2019, 112 crashes have injured 54 people here—five of them pedestrians. The intersection currently favors cars, forcing pedestrians on long detours. The redesign will dead-end Beach 35th Street, add raised bike lanes, and expand pedestrian space. Final design is due next year, with construction set for 2027 and completion by 2029.

Richards opposes lifting mandates in Queens, citing poor transit. Marmorato lobbied to restore mandates in a Bronx rezoning near new Metro North stations, arguing, 'We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities.' The editorial rebukes this logic, stating, 'We should not cling to parking mandates when we know they encourage car ownership, make streets less vibrant, increase rents, and pollute our air.' The piece urges officials to break the cycle of car-first policy, invest in transit, and end mandates that block affordable housing and safer streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the editorial centers the harm parking mandates inflict on vulnerable road users and the city’s livability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He wants parking mandates gone in dense, transit-rich hubs but kept in car-dependent outer Queens. The split stance leaves vulnerable road users exposed in sprawling, car-heavy neighborhoods.</p><p class=mb3>On August 27, 2024, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards issued a statement on Mayor Adams’s ‘City of Yes’ zoning proposal. Richards supports removing parking mandates in high-density, transit-rich areas—like downtown Jamaica, Flushing, and Long Island City—saying, “Parking mandates in major transit hubs... should be eliminated, in order to increase housing opportunities there.” But he opposes ending parking mandates citywide, insisting they remain in low-density, outer transit-oriented development areas (OTODAs) due to infrequent Long Island Rail Road service and car dependence. Richards claims, “This is the reality of living in a transit desert.” The move splits the city, keeping car-centric policies in place for much of Queens. Housing advocates and the mayor’s office argue that citywide parking reform is needed to spur housing and reduce car reliance, but Richards’s stance preserves systemic danger for vulnerable road users in sprawling neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cabán’s platform promised safer streets and fewer cars. Ariola and others say the tickets show a gap between words and actions.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2024, Councilwoman Joann Ariola (District 32) publicly criticized Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán after media reports revealed Cabán received four school-zone speeding tickets and three other violations since November 2022. The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He backs lifting mandates in dense, transit-rich zones but blocks changes in car-dependent areas. Civic leaders echo him. The move keeps cars central, leaving pedestrians and cyclists exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On August 9, 2024, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards issued a public statement opposing the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity rezoning as it relates to eliminating mandatory parking requirements citywide. Richards said, "You can't use the one-size-fits-all approach here. There are really parts of Queens that are transit deserts." He supports removing parking mandates only in high-density, transit-rich areas, not in low-density, car-dependent neighborhoods. Community board leaders and civic groups in Queens joined him, arguing the reform threatens their way of life. Richards's stance contrasts with Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Bronx officials, who support ending parking minimums. The decision preserves car dominance in Queens, leaving vulnerable road users at risk and blocking safer, people-first streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
