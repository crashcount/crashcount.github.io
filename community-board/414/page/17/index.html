Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, children, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at night. They are the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last week, two NYPD cruisers collided in Edgemere while racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital. The news called it a crash, but it could have been worse. No bystanders died this time. Two police cruisers <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>collided while responding to a call in the Rockaways</a>. The street was left littered with glass and twisted metal.</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed seven. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. But the injuries add up. Cars and trucks caused <strong>244 injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Bikes, four. Each number is a broken body, a life changed.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, <strong>42 people under 18 were hurt</strong>. One was killed. The old are not spared either. Eleven people over 75 were injured. One sharp turn, one missed stop, and a life is gone.</p><h2 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h2><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some do not.</strong> State Senator James Sanders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children.

The pedestrian sustained a fractured and dislocated injury to her knee, lower leg, and foot, classified as injury severity 3. The report cites the driver's failure to yield right-of-way and driver inattention or distraction as contributing factors. The vehicle impacted the pedestrian at the center front end, yet the vehicle sustained no damage. The driver’s unlicensed status and distracted left turn created a hazardous condition that led to serious injury, highlighting systemic risks posed by driver errors at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, announced on February 8, 2024, removes prior compromises—no phased rollout, no mandatory training, no ID hurdles. The measure, previously stripped down in committee, now returns to its original form. The matter title: 'Prophet Motive: Restler Bill Would Restore 25% Bounty for Blocked Bike and Bus Lane Tickets.' Restler vows to push hard for passage, saying, 'This bill would make a tremendous difference in making our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.' The bill’s fate is uncertain after Restler’s removal from the Transportation Committee, but the intent is clear: shift enforcement from NYPD to the people, and clear the way for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers (District 31), chair of the Transportation Committee, criticized Vision Zero’s uneven impact. The report, titled "NYC streets have gotten safer under Vision Zero – especially if you live in a white neighborhood," found that while traffic fatalities dropped citywide, majority-Black communities saw a 13% increase and Latino areas a 30% rise. Brooks-Powers said, "It is deeply concerning that communities of color are experiencing fatalities at higher rates." The report states, "It's clear the program has not been fully or effectively implemented in neighborhoods of color and with lower incomes." DOT spokesperson Anna Correa responded that recent plans focus more resources on high-poverty, non-white neighborhoods, but the safety gap persists.

With help from Bloomberg-backed advisors, they outpace larger rivals. Grants target pedestrian danger. Local leaders credit technical aid and strong stories. More small towns now chase life-saving funds.</p><p class=mb3>""The Cities signing up are smaller and often less well-resourced, and they’re drawing down bigger-than-average grants as a result of the technical assistance they’re getting. We’re really proud to be converting ambitions and dreams into winning applications and real safety on the ground."" -- Khaleel Anderson</p><p class=mb3>On January 22, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported that small cities are securing major federal grants for street safety. Clarkston, Georgia, with high traffic-fatality rates, won $1 million from the Safe Streets and Roads for All grant to craft a safety plan. The Local Infrastructure Hub, co-led by Bloomberg Philanthropies, provides technical help, boosting applications. Mayor Beverley Burks of Clarkston said, "You have to be willing to invest in yourself as a city... Having someone who had the skillset to be able to help write the narrative – that’s very crucial for the reviewers to understand the needs in your community." James Anderson, also quoted, highlighted how technical assistance turns ambition into real safety. Other small cities, like Globe, Arizona, and Gladewater, Texas, have also won grants for pedestrian safety. These wins show federal money can reach vulnerable road users in overlooked places.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On January 12, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported on the failure of new concrete barriers meant to protect bike lanes on Park Avenue in the Bronx. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
