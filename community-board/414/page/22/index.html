A child rides home from school. In Queens CB14, these simple acts can end in blood. <strong>Since 2022, 11 people have died and 1,127 have been injured in crashes here</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>). The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. <strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, motorcycles, and even bikes add to the toll. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. They only grow.</p><h2 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h2><p>A 19-year-old woman, struck at an intersection. A baby, killed on the North Channel Bridge. A 52-year-old woman, gone on Beach Channel Drive. <strong>In the last 12 months alone, 352 people were hurt and one killed.</strong> Children are not spared. Forty-one under 18 were injured.

Assembly Member <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">Stacey Pheffer Amato co-sponsored bills</a> for safer roads. But these are words on paper. The street waits for action, not promises.</p><p><strong>Some leaders have worked against progress.</strong> Pheffer Amato <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/16/watchdog-group-no-toll-exemptions-for-cops>backed a bill</a> to give NYPD officers a break from congestion pricing. That means less money for transit, more cars, and more danger for those on foot or bike. <strong>When leaders delay or dodge, people die.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Residents must demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to fund street redesigns, enforce speed limits, and protect the most vulnerable. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The announcement, made at One Police Plaza, highlighted the bill sponsored by Simon and Sen. John Liu. The matter summary states, 'Officials called on Albany to pass legislation to lower the BAC threshold to .05%, arguing it would reduce DWI fatalities by about 10% and align with other countries.' Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but officials cite 43 NYC DWI deaths in 2021 and say 30% of state crashes involve alcohol.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill faces opposition from Council Members David Weprin, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan, who argue it will hurt small businesses and outer-borough residents. On May 22, 2023, Ari Kagan said, 'Congestion Pricing will hurt countless New Yorkers, small businesses, residents of so-called outer-boroughs & will create huge lines of parked cars right outside of Manhattan.' Yet, the MTA’s assessment shows only 5,200 city drivers commute by car from areas far from fast transit—just 1.2% of that population. Advocates like Felicia Park-Rogers counter, 'this policy has the potential to be utterly transformational for our city.' The plan includes exemptions for disabled and low-income drivers.

The resolution, led by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, is a required step before state passage. Brooks-Powers had withheld support until the bill included street redesigns for safety, especially in low-income communities of color. She said, 'Lowering speed limits works best when paired with traffic calming and street safety infrastructure.' The resolution now has 23 co-sponsors, three short of a majority. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver. Last year, the Council failed to pass a home rule message under Speaker Adams.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s matter title: 'The Department of Transportation must study the safety benefits of 'daylighting' and implement the street safety measure that helps improve visibility at a minimum of 100 intersections each year.' Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7.
