Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, children, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at night. They are the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last week, two NYPD cruisers collided in Edgemere while racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital. The news called it a crash, but it could have been worse. No bystanders died this time. Two police cruisers <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>collided while responding to a call in the Rockaways</a>. The street was left littered with glass and twisted metal.</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed seven. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. But the injuries add up. Cars and trucks caused <strong>244 injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Bikes, four. Each number is a broken body, a life changed.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, <strong>42 people under 18 were hurt</strong>. One was killed. The old are not spared either. Eleven people over 75 were injured. One sharp turn, one missed stop, and a life is gone.</p><h2 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h2><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some do not.</strong> State Senator James Sanders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children.

Accountability missing. The numbers do not lie.</p><p class=mb3>On May 11, 2022, the City Council's Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, held an oversight hearing on NYPD traffic enforcement. NYPD Transportation Bureau Chief Kim Royster testified, stating, "So far this year, bike lane enforcement is up 148 percent." Streetsblog fact-checked this claim and found enforcement was actually down 6.4 percent from the previous year. Royster later clarified she referred only to tickets for driving in bike lanes, a small slice of total enforcement. Combined, bike lane enforcement was still down over 4 percent. Brooks-Powers questioned enforcement against illegally parked tractor-trailers. Royster cited fine amounts but gave no enforcement numbers. Data showed code 78 and code 6 violations both dropped sharply. Royster's answers were vague, lacking specifics on enforcement or safety. The hearing exposed a gap between NYPD claims and reality, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort, not tied to a council bill, was revealed as city policy. The campaign aims to cut traffic violence through billboards and media buys. The official summary states it targets driver behavior. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, acknowledged the need for infrastructure investments over media campaigns. Jessie Singer, journalist and author, called the campaign a waste, arguing the city should focus on redesigning intersections. A recent study found similar efforts in Texas increased crash risk.

Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024.

The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.'

Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said, 'Fully electrifying our bus fleet is a critical step forward to preserving our environment and protecting our families.' MTA Chairman Janno Lieber called mass transit 'the antidote to climate change.' The rollout, however, is slow. High electricity costs and limited charging infrastructure stall progress. New York State has budgeted $1.1 billion for 500 electric buses in its 2020-2024 capital plan.

Danger persists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a plan to move Q60 buses from the service road to a dedicated mainline lane along Queens Boulevard, between Roosevelt Avenue and Union Turnpike. The project, under the 'Great Streets' program, is split into four phases, with construction for later phases delayed until at least 2024. The matter summary states: 'transform the currently barren median into a linear park to create a safe and easy way of traversing neighborhoods.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards pledged $1 million to the first phase, stating, 'it really creates an unsafe scenario, especially for pedestrians and cyclists.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone said the redesign 'greatly improv[es] pedestrian safety while also drawing a huge number of new cyclists.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives called the delays 'unacceptable.'

The violations occurred between May 2020 and April 2022. Brooks-Powers represents Southeast Queens, an area plagued by pedestrian and motorist fatalities. The matter surfaced in April 2022, with Brooks-Powers admitting responsibility for most tickets. She stated, 'public safety is very important to me,' and pledged to improve. Under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, she must complete a safety course or risk car impoundment. Her tickets have been paid, so her car was not towed.

Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said the goal is 'to make our thoroughfares safer and more accessible, while increasing New York's pedestrian plazas footprint.' The Council’s proposal comes as the mayor’s $98.5-billion budget lacks dedicated funding for these safety upgrades. Advocates for bus and bike infrastructure support the Council’s push.

Richards</p><p class=mb3>On March 30, 2022, the MTA released a second draft of its Queens bus network redesign. The plan, not tied to a bill number, is a policy proposal under review. It follows backlash to the 2019 draft and pandemic delays. The redesign boosts routes from 77 to 85, adds 20 new lines, and drops the revenue-neutral rule. Hundreds of stops will be cut to speed service. The MTA and NYC DOT picked 49 corridors for upgrades like bus lanes. The official summary states the plan 'incorporates feedback from over 11,000 customer comments and aims to address previous criticisms.' MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'We know we need to get it right this time.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and advocates like Riders Alliance back the effort but call for more equity and engagement.
