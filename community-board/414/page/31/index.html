Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, children, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at night. They are the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last week, two NYPD cruisers collided in Edgemere while racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital. The news called it a crash, but it could have been worse. No bystanders died this time. Two police cruisers <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>collided while responding to a call in the Rockaways</a>.

Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. But the injuries add up. Cars and trucks caused <strong>244 injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Bikes, four. Each number is a broken body, a life changed.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, <strong>42 people under 18 were hurt</strong>. One was killed. The old are not spared either. Eleven people over 75 were injured. One sharp turn, one missed stop, and a life is gone.</p><h2 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h2><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some do not.</strong> State Senator James Sanders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children.

The silence is loud.</p><p>Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>called for more daylight at intersections</a>, co-sponsoring a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. She said, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.

Two hundred seventy-three people died on New York streets. Hit-and-runs soared. SUVs killed more. Brooklyn bled most. Leaders promise fixes. Streets remain deadly. Urgency fills the air. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>A final analysis released January 26, 2022, revealed 2021 as the deadliest year in the eight-year history of New York City's Vision Zero initiative, with 273 road deaths—a 32 percent jump from 2018. The Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, faces mounting pressure. The matter summary states: 'A final analysis of 2021 crash statistics revealed that it was the deadliest year in the eight-year history of New York City's Vision Zero initiative.' Transportation Alternatives demanded urgent action: reclaiming street space from cars, redesigning intersections, upgrading bike lanes, and more. Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez pledged intersection redesigns and stronger bike lanes, but no changes have rolled out. Brooks-Powers called every death 'an avoidable tragedy' and vowed to push for safer streets. The city stands at a crossroads. Vulnerable road users pay the price for delay.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hochul announced the Interborough Express (IBX) project, a new train line connecting Bay Ridge in Brooklyn to Jackson Heights in Queens. The project is in early stages, with environmental review and public input ahead. The MTA’s feasibility study considered light rail, commuter rail, and bus rapid transit, aiming for a 45-minute end-to-end trip. The matter summary states: 'New York City is getting a new train line, the Interborough Express (IBX), thanks to Gov. Hochul's support for passenger service on the rail right of way connecting Queens and Brooklyn.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso voiced support at the announcement. The project uses existing right-of-way, avoiding eminent domain, but faces challenges with freight integration, track upgrades, and uncertain costs. Modular station designs aim to keep expenses down.

She represents District 31 in southeast Queens, an area with limited transit and high car use. The committee oversees key street safety and mobility issues. Brooks-Powers said, 'Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.' She supports expanding protected bike lanes, bus lanes, open streets, and ferry access, but has mixed views on dedicated bus lanes due to local bottlenecks. Brooks-Powers plans to consult with colleagues, advocates, and experts in her first 100 days to address traffic violence and congestion.
