Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, children, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at night. They are the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last week, two NYPD cruisers collided in Edgemere while racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital. The news called it a crash, but it could have been worse. No bystanders died this time. Two police cruisers <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>collided while responding to a call in the Rockaways</a>.

Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. But the injuries add up. Cars and trucks caused <strong>244 injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Bikes, four. Each number is a broken body, a life changed.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, <strong>42 people under 18 were hurt</strong>. One was killed. The old are not spared either. Eleven people over 75 were injured. One sharp turn, one missed stop, and a life is gone.</p><h2 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h2><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some do not.</strong> State Senator James Sanders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children.

The silence is loud.</p><p>Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>called for more daylight at intersections</a>, co-sponsoring a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. She said, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.

He backs lifting mandates in dense, transit-rich zones but blocks changes in car-dependent areas. Civic leaders echo him. The move keeps cars central, leaving pedestrians and cyclists exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On August 9, 2024, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards issued a public statement opposing the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity rezoning as it relates to eliminating mandatory parking requirements citywide. Richards said, "You can't use the one-size-fits-all approach here. There are really parts of Queens that are transit deserts." He supports removing parking mandates only in high-density, transit-rich areas, not in low-density, car-dependent neighborhoods. Community board leaders and civic groups in Queens joined him, arguing the reform threatens their way of life. Richards's stance contrasts with Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Bronx officials, who support ending parking minimums. The decision preserves car dominance in Queens, leaving vulnerable road users at risk and blocking safer, people-first streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders, workers, and streets pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, Governor Hochul’s official pause on congestion pricing triggered a $12 billion loss in MTA contracts, according to a Reinvent Albany report. The move slashes funding for the 2020-24 MTA capital plan, which was to be partly paid by congestion pricing. The report highlights that many companies losing contracts are in districts represented by lawmakers who either support the pause or have stayed silent. Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick called congestion pricing 'simply another tax' and demanded repeal. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow praised the pause, saying it allows time to address 'communities' concerns.' Frank Russo, president of Ozone Park Lumber, warned, 'You can't just say, 'We're not going to buy supplies and equipment.'' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany said, 'Congestion pricing is an economic booster.' The pause means less money for transit, fewer jobs, and more risk for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, reliable public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brannan, along with Council Member Shekar Krishnan and Borough Presidents Donovan Richards and Antonio Reynoso, urged the city to extend the beach season, increase lifeguard shifts, and offer universal swimming lessons. The city has only 870 lifeguards, far short of the 1,500 needed. Vulnerable swimmers remain at risk while officials debate.
