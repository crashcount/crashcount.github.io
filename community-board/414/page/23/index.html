A child rides home from school. In Queens CB14, these simple acts can end in blood. <strong>Since 2022, 11 people have died and 1,127 have been injured in crashes here</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>). The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. <strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, motorcycles, and even bikes add to the toll.

A baby, killed on the North Channel Bridge. A 52-year-old woman, gone on Beach Channel Drive. <strong>In the last 12 months alone, 352 people were hurt and one killed.</strong> Children are not spared. Forty-one under 18 were injured.

Assembly Member <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">Stacey Pheffer Amato co-sponsored bills</a> for safer roads. But these are words on paper. The street waits for action, not promises.</p><p><strong>Some leaders have worked against progress.</strong> Pheffer Amato <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/16/watchdog-group-no-toll-exemptions-for-cops>backed a bill</a> to give NYPD officers a break from congestion pricing. That means less money for transit, more cars, and more danger for those on foot or bike. <strong>When leaders delay or dodge, people die.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Residents must demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to fund street redesigns, enforce speed limits, and protect the most vulnerable. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They dodge cameras. They dodge tolls. The city loses millions. Council cracks down. Brooks-Powers calls it a safety threat. New laws ban cover sales. DOT must now report evaders. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On November 26, 2022, the New York City Council took legislative action to combat license plate obscuring, a tactic used by drivers to evade tolls and traffic cameras. The matter, described as 'banning the sale of toll-beating covers and requiring DOT to report cars evading red lights and speed cameras with unreadable license plates,' passed through the transportation and infrastructure committee. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, chair of the committee and sponsor, stated, 'It’s a safety issue, it’s an issue in terms of [city] revenue, it’s an issue in terms of ensuring we have safe streets and holding people accountable.' The city has lost $19 million this year due to unreadable plates. The new laws aim to close loopholes and restore accountability, but the risk to pedestrians and cyclists from untraceable drivers remains high.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
