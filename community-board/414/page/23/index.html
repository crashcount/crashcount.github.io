Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, children, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at night. They are the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last week, two NYPD cruisers collided in Edgemere while racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital. The news called it a crash, but it could have been worse. No bystanders died this time. Two police cruisers <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>collided while responding to a call in the Rockaways</a>.

Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. But the injuries add up. Cars and trucks caused <strong>244 injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Bikes, four. Each number is a broken body, a life changed.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, <strong>42 people under 18 were hurt</strong>. One was killed. The old are not spared either. Eleven people over 75 were injured. One sharp turn, one missed stop, and a life is gone.</p><h2 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h2><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some do not.</strong> State Senator James Sanders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children.

The silence is loud.</p><p>Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>called for more daylight at intersections</a>, co-sponsoring a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. She said, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.

The bill faces opposition from Council Members David Weprin, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan, who argue it will hurt small businesses and outer-borough residents. On May 22, 2023, Ari Kagan said, 'Congestion Pricing will hurt countless New Yorkers, small businesses, residents of so-called outer-boroughs & will create huge lines of parked cars right outside of Manhattan.' Yet, the MTA’s assessment shows only 5,200 city drivers commute by car from areas far from fast transit—just 1.2% of that population. Advocates like Felicia Park-Rogers counter, 'this policy has the potential to be utterly transformational for our city.' The plan includes exemptions for disabled and low-income drivers. Most New Yorkers stand to gain safer, better-funded transit and less congestion.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She argued, "DOT has a responsibility to also ensure that there also is parking, even municipal lots or garages available, as we look to share the street." Brooks-Powers claimed more parking would clear cars from bus and bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Executive Deputy Commissioner Paul Ochoa disagreed, stressing the need to share streets among all users. Brooks-Powers has opposed bus lane projects and a safety redesign in her own district, despite high traffic fatality rates. Her stance favors drivers, not vulnerable road users. No safety analyst has assessed the impact, but her opposition to proven safety measures puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, led by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, is a required step before state passage. Brooks-Powers had withheld support until the bill included street redesigns for safety, especially in low-income communities of color. She said, 'Lowering speed limits works best when paired with traffic calming and street safety infrastructure.' The resolution now has 23 co-sponsors, three short of a majority. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver.

Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers must hold a hearing before a vote. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Brooks-Powers have not signed on, citing negotiations. The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.' Data show slower speeds save lives. Advocates and victims’ families keep pushing.

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), committee chair, sponsored the bill. The measure requires the Department of Transportation to study daylighting—removing parking near corners to improve visibility—and then install it at 100 intersections each year starting in 2025. The bill’s matter title: 'The Department of Transportation must study the safety benefits of 'daylighting' and implement the street safety measure that helps improve visibility at a minimum of 100 intersections each year.' Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez initially objected, citing concerns about driver speed, but supported the amended bill requiring physical barriers. The law comes after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a non-daylighted intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter title reads: 'NYC Council tackles bills on policing, homeless rights and charity gambling.' Narcisse is listed as a sponsor. These actions aim to cut risk for pedestrians and seniors, especially at dangerous crossings. The council’s stance is clear: support for pedestrian safety zones, traffic calming, more crash studies, and daylighting.

Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On April 12, 2023, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams declined to support Sammy’s Law, a state bill allowing New York City to control its speed limits. The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a reckless driver in 2013, has stalled in Albany despite mounting pressure. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, co-sponsored by Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler. Adams, however, said, 'We’re going to let the state do what the state does in response to Sammy’s Law,' and focused on other budget priorities. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk. The law would not lower limits automatically, but grant the city authority to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crackdown aims to stop the chaos.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 988, introduced on April 11, 2023, targets the sale of fake license plates in New York City. The bill, sponsored by Oswald Feliz, Marjorie Velázquez, and Lincoln Restler, amends laws to ban selling counterfeit tags, with fines starting at $1,000 for first offenses and $2,000 for repeat violations. The measure was brought before the City Council and discussed at a City Hall press conference. The matter summary states the bill 'goes after the unscrupulous used car dealers profiting considerably off a huge black market for phony tags.' Restler, as a sponsor, joins efforts to curb the spread of ghost cars, which evade speed cameras and tolls, making streets more dangerous for everyone. Lawmakers stress that the goal is deterrence, not revenue, and call for further action from online marketplaces and federal agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
