Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, children, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at night. They are the silence that follows.</p><p>Just last week, two NYPD cruisers collided in Edgemere while racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital. The news called it a crash, but it could have been worse. No bystanders died this time. Two police cruisers <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>collided while responding to a call in the Rockaways</a>. The street was left littered with glass and twisted metal.</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed seven. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. But the injuries add up. Cars and trucks caused <strong>244 injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Bikes, four. Each number is a broken body, a life changed.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, <strong>42 people under 18 were hurt</strong>. One was killed. The old are not spared either. Eleven people over 75 were injured. One sharp turn, one missed stop, and a life is gone.</p><h2 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h2><p><strong>Some leaders act. Some do not.</strong> State Senator James Sanders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children.

Subway, bus, light rail, and ferry all on the table. Council Member Larinda Hooks backed the AirTrain and ferry. No decision. The city waits. Danger and delay remain.</p><p class=mb3>"The only one that makes sense is the train from 30th street straight from LaGuardia. You want to get to LaGuardia fast. We wouldn’t be here if the buses worked. Chicago has it, why can’t we have it?" -- Khaleel Anderson</p><p class=mb3>On March 27, 2022, a public consultation in Queens reviewed 14 alternatives for LaGuardia Airport transit access. The session followed Governor Hochul’s cancellation of the Willets Point AirTrain. The event, covered by the media and led by a panel including Janette Sadik-Khan, drew strong opinions. The matter summary: 'In Astoria, Queens, 14 possible transit options for connecting to LaGuardia Airport were presented at a public comment session.' Council Member Larinda Hooks (District 35) voiced support for the original AirTrain, ferry service, and other mass transit options, but opposed removing parking or traffic lanes. Hooks said, 'The original plan is still the best plan... It doesn’t go near anybody’s house.' The process continues. No final plan. Vulnerable road users still face risk as traffic and confusion persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler said, 'We need a real busway on Jay Street,' citing rampant illegal driving and slow service. The rally criticized City Hall for ambitious targets but no concrete plans.

Community Board 3’s Michelle Kuppersmith highlighted the need for political will.

Wilfredo Florentino, Brooklyn Community Board 5, says, “Just placing cameras ain't gonna cut it.” The analysis shows that dangerous, wide arterials in communities of color drive up traffic violence.

The report, not tied to a specific bill, reviewed automated enforcement and street design. It found speed cameras are evenly distributed and reduce crashes, but dangerous road design still puts lives at risk. Adams and other leaders called for more cameras and urgent street redesigns, echoing the article’s summary: 'Cameras have led to fewer crashes, injuries, and fatalities, but high numbers of tickets in some neighborhoods are attributed to unsafe road design, not camera placement.' Community voices stressed that automated enforcement helps, but cannot replace permanent fixes to deadly streets. The Department of Transportation’s lack of transparency on camera locations remains a concern.
