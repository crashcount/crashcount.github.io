In Queens CB13, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Twenty-five people are dead. Twenty-eight more are left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 4,400 have been hurt since 2022. The crashes keep coming. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 39-year-old man was killed on Nashville Boulevard. He was ejected from his motorized scooter after an SUV turned left. The crash report lists the cause as &ldquo;driver inattention.&rdquo; The man died from crush injuries. He did not get a second chance. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On the Belt Parkway, a 27-year-old woman lost her life in February. She was driving. The car was going straight. The report says &ldquo;unsafe speed.&rdquo; She was ejected and died at the scene. Her passenger was injured. The road stayed open. The city moved on.</p><h2 id=buses-cars-and-the-human-cost>Buses, Cars, and the Human Cost</h2><p>The machines are heavy. The people are not. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm</strong>—four deaths, 397 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 27. Bikes left two with minor wounds. The numbers are cold, but the stories burn. A van crash in February killed a 78-year-old woman. She sat in the back seat. She never made it home.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The politicians talk. Some act. Senator Leroy Comrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to curb repeat speeders</a>, backing a bill to require speed-limiting devices for drivers who rack up violations. Assembly Member Clyde Vanel <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, a move to protect children on foot.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The crashes do not wait for new laws. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done enough. The streets are still wide. The cars are still fast. The bodies are still broken.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Call your assembly member.</strong> Tell them the numbers are not just numbers. They are lives. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and cycling. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.'

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), committee chair, sponsored the bill. The measure requires the Department of Transportation to study daylighting—removing parking near corners to improve visibility—and then install it at 100 intersections each year starting in 2025. The bill’s matter title: 'The Department of Transportation must study the safety benefits of 'daylighting' and implement the street safety measure that helps improve visibility at a minimum of 100 intersections each year.' Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez initially objected, citing concerns about driver speed, but supported the amended bill requiring physical barriers. The law comes after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a non-daylighted intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The session included Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, who supported the measures. The bills, as summarized, would require the Department of Transportation to create pedestrian zones for seniors, install traffic calming devices, increase the frequency of serious crash studies, and implement 'daylighting'—removing parking near intersections—at 100 sites starting January 1, 2025. The matter title reads: 'NYC Council tackles bills on policing, homeless rights and charity gambling.' Narcisse is listed as a sponsor. These actions aim to cut risk for pedestrians and seniors, especially at dangerous crossings. The council’s stance is clear: support for pedestrian safety zones, traffic calming, more crash studies, and daylighting. The vote signals a push for systemic change on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said his agency is open to talks after earlier resistance. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, committee chair, voiced concerns about public conflict. Restler insisted, 'People are dying on our streets. This will save lives.' Advocates remain divided.

Adams, however, said, 'We’re going to let the state do what the state does in response to Sammy’s Law,' and focused on other budget priorities. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.
