Four of them were over 75. One was just 26. The violence does not stop for age.</p><p><strong>Crashes come steady as rain.</strong> In the last year, there were over 2,100 crashes. Seven left people with serious injuries. Most victims were in cars, but the sidewalk is no refuge. Pedestrians and cyclists are struck by SUVs, sedans, vans, trucks, buses.

In February, a 27-year-old woman was killed on the Belt Parkway. She was ejected from her car. The cause: unsafe speed. The stories repeat. The endings do not change.

The announcement, made at One Police Plaza, highlighted the bill sponsored by Simon and Sen. John Liu. The matter summary states, 'Officials called on Albany to pass legislation to lower the BAC threshold to .05%, arguing it would reduce DWI fatalities by about 10% and align with other countries.' Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but officials cite 43 NYC DWI deaths in 2021 and say 30% of state crashes involve alcohol.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter was introduced May 25, 2023, and filed at session’s end, never reaching enactment. The resolution’s title: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation that would create a surcharge for for-hire vehicles (FHVs) that would go towards funding the expansion of wheelchair accessible and all-electric FHVs.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, and Shahana K. Hanif sponsored the measure.

The resolution, led by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, is a required step before state passage. Brooks-Powers had withheld support until the bill included street redesigns for safety, especially in low-income communities of color. She said, 'Lowering speed limits works best when paired with traffic calming and street safety infrastructure.' The resolution now has 23 co-sponsors, three short of a majority. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver. Last year, the Council failed to pass a home rule message under Speaker Adams.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
