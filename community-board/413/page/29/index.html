Twenty-nine seriously hurt.</strong> Four thousand more injured since 2022. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, July 5th, a BMW hit a divider on the Belt Parkway.</strong> It vaulted into oncoming traffic. Two young lives ended. The car burned. Police said, &ldquo;No one in the doomed BMW was wearing a seat belt&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>NY Daily News</a>). Three others survived. The road was closed for hours. The scars will last longer.</p><p>On June 26th, a man riding a motorized scooter on Nashville Boulevard was killed. The crash report lists &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction.&rdquo; He was ejected. He died there. Another number. Another family left behind (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-streets-are-not-safe>The Streets Are Not Safe</h3><p><strong>Most of the dead are not drivers.</strong> They are passengers, walkers, riders. The old and the young. Four children under 18 have died here since 2022. Four more over 75. The city calls them accidents. But the pattern is clear. Unsafe speeds. Lane changes. Distraction. The same mistakes, over and over.</p><p>A bus crash in Queens Village left four hurt. Emily McKinnon was on board. &ldquo;I was holding on for my life back there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The bus driver didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong&mldr; then the crane just hits us&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>ABC7</a>).</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders Talk.

She has voted to legalize jaywalking, to collect micromobility data, to lower speed limits on Open Streets. She co-sponsored bills for better lighting, more speed humps, and safer crossings. But the deaths keep coming. Promises do not stop cars.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign deadly roads. It can end the reign of repeat speeders. But it will not act unless you force it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking.</strong> Do not wait for the next siren. The next name. The next number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The announcement, made at One Police Plaza, highlighted the bill sponsored by Simon and Sen. John Liu. The matter summary states, 'Officials called on Albany to pass legislation to lower the BAC threshold to .05%, arguing it would reduce DWI fatalities by about 10% and align with other countries.' Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but officials cite 43 NYC DWI deaths in 2021 and say 30% of state crashes involve alcohol.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It called on the New York State Legislature and Governor to create a surcharge for for-hire vehicles (FHVs), with funds aimed at expanding wheelchair-accessible and all-electric FHVs. The matter was introduced May 25, 2023, and filed at session’s end, never reaching enactment. The resolution’s title: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation that would create a surcharge for for-hire vehicles (FHVs) that would go towards funding the expansion of wheelchair accessible and all-electric FHVs.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, and Shahana K. Hanif sponsored the measure. The bill noted that only 4,858 of 95,129 FHVs were wheelchair accessible in 2022, and just 1% were all-electric.

The resolution, led by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, is a required step before state passage. Brooks-Powers had withheld support until the bill included street redesigns for safety, especially in low-income communities of color. She said, 'Lowering speed limits works best when paired with traffic calming and street safety infrastructure.' The resolution now has 23 co-sponsors, three short of a majority. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver. Last year, the Council failed to pass a home rule message under Speaker Adams.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects.
