In Queens CB13, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Twenty-five people are dead. Twenty-eight more are left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 4,400 have been hurt since 2022. The crashes keep coming. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 39-year-old man was killed on Nashville Boulevard. He was ejected from his motorized scooter after an SUV turned left. The crash report lists the cause as &ldquo;driver inattention.&rdquo; The man died from crush injuries. He did not get a second chance. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On the Belt Parkway, a 27-year-old woman lost her life in February. She was driving. The car was going straight. The report says &ldquo;unsafe speed.&rdquo; She was ejected and died at the scene. Her passenger was injured. The road stayed open. The city moved on.</p><h2 id=buses-cars-and-the-human-cost>Buses, Cars, and the Human Cost</h2><p>The machines are heavy. The people are not. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm</strong>—four deaths, 397 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 27. Bikes left two with minor wounds. The numbers are cold, but the stories burn. A van crash in February killed a 78-year-old woman. She sat in the back seat. She never made it home.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The politicians talk. Some act. Senator Leroy Comrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to curb repeat speeders</a>, backing a bill to require speed-limiting devices for drivers who rack up violations. Assembly Member Clyde Vanel <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, a move to protect children on foot.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The crashes do not wait for new laws. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done enough. The streets are still wide. The cars are still fast. The bodies are still broken.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Call your assembly member.</strong> Tell them the numbers are not just numbers. They are lives. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and cycling. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

More routes, fewer stops. Faster trips promised. Community voices shape the draft. Officials urge more input, more funding. Advocates demand equity.

Of course, there's a lot more community input, but there's no such thing as a perfect plan and we should not let perfect be the enemy of good as well."" -- Donovan J. Richards</p><p class=mb3>On March 30, 2022, the MTA released a second draft of its Queens bus network redesign. The plan, not tied to a bill number, is a policy proposal under review. It follows backlash to the 2019 draft and pandemic delays. The redesign boosts routes from 77 to 85, adds 20 new lines, and drops the revenue-neutral rule. Hundreds of stops will be cut to speed service. The MTA and NYC DOT picked 49 corridors for upgrades like bus lanes. The official summary states the plan 'incorporates feedback from over 11,000 customer comments and aims to address previous criticisms.' MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'We know we need to get it right this time.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and advocates like Riders Alliance back the effort but call for more equity and engagement. The plan’s impact on vulnerable road users is not yet assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Richards</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2022, the City Council passed a school zone traffic safety law. The bill, introduced by Inez Barron, requires the Department of Transportation to install traffic control devices at every intersection next to a school by September 30, 2024. Council Member Justin Brannan, representing District 47, called the law a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn't be some huge colossal victory.' The law aims to bypass restrictive federal guidelines that block safety fixes. Council members and residents blasted DOT for slow, arbitrary action and years of denied requests, sometimes only reversed after tragedy. The Adams administration promises to redesign 1,000 more intersections, but families and advocates demand faster, decisive protection for children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She pledged to shift the city's focus from transit-rich areas to those left behind, stressing the need for accessible streets, protection for children, and investment in minority and women-owned businesses.
