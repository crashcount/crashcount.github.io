Eight seriously hurt.</strong> That is the count in Queens CB13 over the last year. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope. They only grow.</p><p>Just last week, a man tried to cross 155th Street at South Conduit Avenue. A car hit him. The driver did not stop. The man died at Jamaica Hospital. Police said, &ldquo;The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>A day before, two men stood at a food truck. A car jumped the curb and killed them both. The street was left with bodies and broken glass. A witness <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>said</a>, &ldquo;I have never seen anything like this,&rdquo; his head in his hands.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months:</strong></p><ul><li>2,505 crashes</li><li>1,813 injured</li><li>12 killed</li></ul><p>The dead do not get a second chance. The living get to wait for the next siren.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> Cars and SUVs are the main weapons: 4 killed, 339 minor injuries, 77 moderate, 6 serious. Trucks and buses killed 2, injured 27 more. Bikes hurt 2. Motorcycles and mopeds did not kill, but the numbers are small. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The old and the young are not spared.

State Senator Leroy Comrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Assembly Member Clyde Vanel voted to extend school speed zones. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>But the streets do not wait for committee votes. The carnage continues. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>said</a>, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.&rdquo; The barriers now are blood and broken bodies.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot call.

The department banned bikes from a major stretch of the Rockaway Boardwalk, closed parts of the Hudson River Greenway, and allowed cars back into Silver Lake Park. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, speaking for local families, condemned the boardwalk ban: "It was about the children that take advantage of biking on the boardwalk...We’re now shifting them into the street." Residents and advocates argue these moves ignore years of complaints about poor maintenance and lack of coordination with DOT. They highlight that car-free conditions in Silver Lake Park improved safety, especially for children. Advocates call for shifting road maintenance from Parks to DOT and demand structural changes. The Parks Department’s focus on recreation, not transportation, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They slam the seasonal ban as a blow to street life. Lawmakers blame high fees and red tape for empty curb lanes. The fight pits parking against people. The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, the City Council debated a new bill to bring back year-round roadway dining. The measure, still in committee, follows the 2023 law that limited outdoor dining to April through November. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) leads the charge, calling the current law a 'failure' that 'prioritized parking spots over vibrant streets.' Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Lawmakers and advocates agree: high costs, bureaucracy, and seasonality block participation and hurt street life. The bill's fate remains undecided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
