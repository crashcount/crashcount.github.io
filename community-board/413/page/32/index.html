Promises are not enough.</p><p class=mb3>On October 17, 2023, a report spotlighted a deadly surge in cyclist fatalities across New York City, with District 31—represented by Council Transportation Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers—bearing the highest toll. The matter, titled 'Crunching the Data on the Record-Setting Year For Cyclist Deaths,' details that 94 percent of victims died on streets lacking protected bike lanes. Transportation Alternatives called on Brooks-Powers and her Council colleagues to pass Intro 417, which would eliminate a three-month wait and speed up bike lane construction. Brooks-Powers, mentioned as district representative, faces mounting pressure as advocates decry delays and demand urgent action. The report states: 'Promises won’t keep bike riders safe – but completed, fully protected bike lanes will. The time to act is now.' The city’s failure to meet the NYC Streets Plan benchmarks has left vulnerable road users exposed, with advocates urging immediate follow-through on essential street redesigns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders keep dying.</p><p class=mb3>A new report from Transportation Alternatives, published October 17, 2023, slams Mayor Adams for failing to meet the City Council-mandated NYC Streets Plan. The report states, 'Traffic crashes in New York City killed more cyclists through the first nine months of 2023 than all but one other year on record.' Adams promised 75 miles of new protected bike lanes each year but delivered just 26.3 miles in 2022, missing the 30-mile benchmark and falling far short of the 50-mile requirement for 2023. Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, accused Adams of putting 'politics over people' and called on Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and colleagues to pass Intro 417, which would eliminate a three-month delay in bike lane construction. DOT spokesman Chris Browne defended the administration, citing nearly 100 street projects.

Riders wait for safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>On October 13, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced the expansion of its e-scooter share program to eastern Queens. The program, which launched in the Bronx in 2021, logged nearly 3 million trips with zero fatalities and few serious injuries in its first year. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Shared e-scooter service can play an important role in providing sustainable options to connect eastern Queens commuters to transit hubs, commercial corridors, and other neighborhood destinations." Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards both voiced support, highlighting the program's focus on underserved communities and environmental benefits. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged the city to pair the expansion with protected infrastructure, warning that safe streets must come with new mobility.

The report, reviewed by Council Transportation Chair Selvena N.

Only half completed the course, violations persisted, and just 12 vehicles were seized. Brooks-Powers stated, 'Holding reckless drivers accountable and keeping our streets safe for all New Yorkers remains a priority.'

Officials dodged questions. Council grilled DOT. Advocates tracked the shortfall. Political meddling blocks safer streets. Vulnerable New Yorkers wait. Progress stalls. Danger stays.</p><p class=mb3>On September 13, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on the Department of Transportation’s progress toward mandated bus and bike lane construction. The hearing, led by Transportation Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for answers. The law requires 150 miles of protected bus lanes and 250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026. In 2022, the city built only 4.4 miles of bus lanes and 26.3 miles of bike lanes, far short of the legal benchmarks. Councilmember Lincoln Restler criticized political interference, saying, 'We're at a point where it's all politics all the time, and we're failing to execute.' Advocacy groups confirmed the city lags behind. The administration’s refusal to track or disclose progress leaves vulnerable road users exposed. The city’s failure to act keeps streets dangerous.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
