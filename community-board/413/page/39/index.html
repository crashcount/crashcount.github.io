In the last twelve months, 12 people died and 1,392 were injured in crashes across Queens CB13. Eight suffered serious injuries. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons. In the past year, four people over 75 died. One was only 18. The violence does not stop for age.</p><p>Just last week, July 5, a 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of a sedan on Cross Island Parkway. Two days earlier, a 39-year-old man was killed, ejected from his scooter on Nashville Boulevard. The week before, a 26-year-old man died behind the wheel on Hillside Avenue. The list does not end. It only grows.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The stories are sharp. A BMW vaults the divider on Belt Parkway. The car catches fire. Passengers are thrown onto the road. &ldquo;They went airborne and into the barrier,&rdquo; a survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>said</a>. &ldquo;Jewel was already dead when she flew out the car,&rdquo; the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>survivor added</a>.</p><p>A bus turns on Springfield Boulevard. A crane slams into its side. Windows shatter. Riders cry out. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us,&rdquo; a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>told reporters</a>. &ldquo;The bus driver didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong,&rdquo; the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>passenger said</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have passed bills. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She has called out the Department of Transportation: &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>Brooks-Powers said</a>.</p><p>But the streets are not safe. The city has not met its own promises. The bodies keep coming. Most deaths are caused by cars and trucks. The old, the young, the careful, the unlucky. All are at risk.</p><h3 id=act-nowdemand-action>Act Now—Demand Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city stop blaming the dead and start protecting the living. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Queens councilwoman hasn’t stopped speeding through NYC despite pledge to do better,' details that Brooks-Powers was caught by city speed cameras on April 24, June 23, and July 22, despite a public promise to 'do better' after 17 prior tickets in 11 months. She has praised speed cameras as vital for protecting 'motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists.' Nearly all violations occurred in Queens, where 27 people died in car crashes this year as of July 31. Brooks-Powers’ record now qualifies her for the dangerous vehicle abatement program, which can mandate a safety course or impoundment. She did not respond to requests for comment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

An opinion from a Transportation Alternatives staffer urged the Council to 'transform impervious driving lanes into green climate solutions.' The piece calls for bioswales and greenspace in place of parking, citing the deadly floods after Hurricane Ida. It highlights that 72 percent of city land is impervious, worsening flash floods. The author presses city leaders, including Mayor Eric Adams, to repurpose street space for climate resilience, referencing the NYC 25x25 challenge. The message is clear: 'Our streets can become the solution to climate change and flooding.'

The bill aimed to 'establish priority for sidewalk repairs at developments operated by the New York City Housing Authority,' giving first priority to senior-only NYCHA buildings, then to other NYCHA sites. Emergencies at non-NYCHA properties could override this order, with required notification to local officials. The bill required DOT to report on completed and pending NYCHA sidewalk repairs by June 30, 2023. Council Member Alexa Avilés sponsored the bill, joined by Abreu, Brooks-Powers, Restler, Hanif, Won, Nurse, Gutiérrez, and Sanchez. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without enactment.

They want trains running where weeds grow. They reject inflated costs. They say transit equity matters. They press for action, not delay. Riders wait. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On August 5, 2022, fifteen elected officials and two community board chairs from Queens signed a letter demanding Governor Hochul and Mayor Adams fund an environmental impact study (EIS) for the QueensLink subway expansion. The proposal, discussed in the City Council’s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, seeks to restore service on the abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch, connecting Rego Park and Ozone Park. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, committee chair, emphasized, 'Transportation equity is a major issue in our city that must be confronted.' The letter criticizes the MTA’s previous cost estimates and compares QueensLink’s need to the state-backed Interborough Express. Supporters argue that if the state can spend $1 billion widening the Van Wyck Expressway, it can fund a study for transit. The EIS would include community engagement to address local concerns. The push is clear: more transit, fewer cars, safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics warn of secrecy and developer giveaways.</p><p class=mb3>On July 27, 2022, the state’s Public Authorities Control Board approved Governor Kathy Hochul’s Penn Station redevelopment plan. The project, described as a 'once-in-a-generation opportunity,' includes 18 million square feet of new office towers, 1,800 apartments, a $7 billion station upgrade, and promises of walkable streets and bike lanes. State Senator Leroy Comrie, representing District 14, voted for the initial PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) agreement but pledged not to support future deals without federal funding and approvals. The plan faces criticism from watchdogs and officials like State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli’s office, who called for a delay due to limited financial details. Reinvent Albany slammed the process for lacking transparency and questioned the reliance on developer tax breaks. The redevelopment’s impact on vulnerable road users remains unassessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter: 'Surf Avenue gets new crosswalk and four-way stop sign, creating a safer intersection for seniors.' Kagan’s office led the push, with Brooks-Powers elevating the issue. Kagan said, 'It was one of the most dangerous intersections in Coney Island, not just for pedestrians but for drivers as well.' The crossing serves the Scheuer House senior facility. Community Board 13 and local groups demanded action. Brooks-Powers praised the advocacy: 'Now, your residents will be able to cross the street safely!'
