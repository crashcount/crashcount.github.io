Twenty-eight seriously hurt.</strong> These are not numbers from a war zone. They are the toll of traffic violence in Queens CB13 since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The bodies are not nameless. A 76-year-old woman, killed in the back seat of a sedan on Cross Island Parkway (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4825309</a>).

The list goes on. The pain does not end.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-unanswered-questions>Recent Crashes, Unanswered Questions</h3><p>The carnage does not slow. <strong>Just last month, a man on a motorized scooter was killed at 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard.</strong> The cause: unsafe speed. He was ejected. He died at the scene (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4823380</a>). In February, a van crash on South Conduit Avenue killed a 78-year-old passenger and injured two others (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4792680</a>). Each crash leaves a hole in a family. Each one could have been prevented.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-miles-to-go>Leadership: Steps Forward, Miles to Go</h3><p>Local leaders have not been silent. <strong>State Senator Leroy Comrie <a href=#citations>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a> and <a href=#citations>to require speed limiters for repeat speeders</a>.</strong> These votes matter. But the streets are still deadly. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, who chairs the City Council’s transportation committee, has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>said</a>, <em>&ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.&rdquo;</em> The barriers remain. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. <strong>Contact your council member. Call your state senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.
