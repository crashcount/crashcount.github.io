Twenty-eight seriously hurt.</strong> Over 4,400 injured since 2022. Each number is a life cut short or broken.</p><p>Just days ago, a 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of a sedan on the Cross Island Parkway. She never made it home. On the Belt Parkway, a BMW went airborne. Two died. Others were thrown from the car, the road burning beneath them. “They went airborne and into the barrier,” a survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>said</a>. “Jewel was already dead when she flew out the car.”</p><p>A crane slammed into a city bus in Queens Village. Four hurt. “We didn’t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us,” a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>said</a>. The bus driver did nothing wrong. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The old, the young, the ones on foot. <strong>SUVs and cars did most of the killing.</strong> Trucks and buses followed. Bikes caused two minor injuries. No one died from a bike. The road is not equal. The strong crush the weak.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers has called for more transparency from DOT. “DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results,” she <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>said</a>. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, a step to stop blaming the dead for crossing the street. She co-sponsored bills for more daylight at corners and better data on e-bikes. But the pace is slow. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead. The road will not change itself. Only you can force their hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Joseph listed twelve locations needing speed humps; only one was approved, none installed. Eight were denied, several remain under review. Her district saw 1,173 crashes this year, injuring 87 cyclists and 141 pedestrians. Joseph, who lost students to traffic violence, calls the delay 'unacceptable.' DOT says it is reviewing her letter.

The bill’s summary: it allows residents to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or fire hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school, creating a $175 fine and a civilian complaint protocol. Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation.

Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance.

The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The crash left the man conscious but badly hurt. The street was left silent after the driver fled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plan targets neglected neighborhoods. It demands real infrastructure, not just paint. Advocates say it will open safe routes, cut danger, and connect the city.</p><p class=mb3>On October 27, 2022, the City Council passed a bill requiring a comprehensive master plan for New York City's greenways. The legislation, championed by Council Member Carlina Rivera and supported by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), mandates the city to study, map, and expand greenways—'highways for cyclists and pedestrians, separated from motor vehicle traffic.' The bill focuses on low-income and underserved neighborhoods, with a final plan due by December 2024 and updates every five years. Rivera said, 'All of us are here today because we believe in a future where New Yorkers of all backgrounds... can safely access active transportation.' Brooks-Powers called it 'a real opportunity... to make a profound impact.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York praised the move, urging the city to build 'real infrastructure for cycling.' The bill passed nearly unanimously, signaling strong council support for safer, more equitable streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law demands annual updates and public engagement. It aims to carve out safe, car-free corridors for walkers and cyclists. The mayor returned it unsigned.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0291-2022, now Local Law 115 of 2022, was enacted by the City Council on November 27, 2022. The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
