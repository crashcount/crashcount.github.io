The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.

They claimed community harm, ignoring hard data. Bike lanes and safer streets faced political fire. DOT stood firm, citing lives saved and broad support. Vulnerable road users caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on DOT street safety projects and Streets Plan implementation. The hearing, led by Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), Christopher Banks (D-Brooklyn), and Rafael Salamanca Jr. (D-Bronx), focused on the DOT's progress under the Streets Plan, which mandates annual targets for protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns. DOT officials defended their process, emphasizing community engagement and prioritizing high-need areas. The council's opposition stands in stark contrast to the projects' proven safety benefits for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This follows Mayor Adams’s earlier $35 million commitment. The matter centers on whether to build a park or restore rail service—"Its purpose is to derail the train," said Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director. City Hall, represented by spokesperson Charles Lutvak, insists, "The proposed Met Hub does not preclude an MTA project if [MTA officials] determine one is feasible." Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi echoed, "Those two don't directly conflict." State Sen. James Sanders Jr. continues to push for QueensLink funding. The city’s investments so far favor the park, leaving the rail proposal in limbo.

The bill orders DOT to create a program letting community centers, schools, arts, and religious institutions use adjacent outdoor spaces. The matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to establish a program to allow community centers, schools, arts and cultural institutions and religious institutions to use adjacent outdoor spaces.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads, joined by Stevens, Restler, Won, and others. The bill has not yet passed. If enacted, it could reclaim space from cars, giving it to people. No formal safety analysis yet, but the measure could mean safer, more vibrant streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
