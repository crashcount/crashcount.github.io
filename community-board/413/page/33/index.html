Nine seriously injured.</strong> In the last year alone, Queens CB13 saw 1,413 people hurt in 1,970 crashes. Five lives ended since January. Three were over 75. The youngest was 25. Each number is a name, a family, a hole in the world.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A 78-year-old man tried to cross Jericho Turnpike. He never made it. The driver who struck him was charged months later with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. He got a desk appearance ticket. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>&ldquo;A driver has been arrested five months after fatally striking a 78-year-old man crossing a heavily traveled Queens intersection, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A woman in her 70s rode in a minivan from a senior home. The van veered off Brookville Boulevard and hit a tree. She died in the back seat. Three others, all seniors, survived. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/14/woman-killed-3-hurt-in-senior-residence-minivan-crash/>&ldquo;A woman was killed and three other people were hospitalized when a trip from a Queens senior residential home turned deadly early Friday, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs took four lives and left six with serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed two. No cyclist killed anyone. No moped. No bike. The most vulnerable—seniors, children, people on foot—pay the price for someone else’s speed or inattention.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h2><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras run 24/7. The law allows lower speed limits. But in Queens CB13, the carnage continues. Charges come late, if at all. The streets do not forgive delay. Every day of inaction is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</strong></h2><p><strong>Contact your council member. Demand lower speed limits and more street redesigns.</strong> Ask why drivers who kill walk free. Tell them the numbers are not just numbers. They are neighbors. They are you. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They demanded daylighting, neckdowns, speed bumps, stop signs, and reflective markings at Newtown Road intersections. The lawmakers wrote, “Nothing can bring back Dolma Naadhun, but we can prevent further loss of life so that no family must experience the loss of a loved one.” DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed a Council bill mandating 100 daylighted intersections per year, arguing for flexibility and physical infrastructure in daylit spaces. Advocates and experts agree: daylighting without barriers is flawed. They call for curb extensions to slow drivers and protect people. Residents remain frustrated by the city’s slow, limited response after repeated deaths and injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s summary states: “The department shall conduct and submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council and post conspicuously on the department's website an annual study on bicycle activity.” Council Members Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, Tiffany Cabán, Crystal Hudson, Kevin C. Riley, and Lynn C. Schulman sponsored the measure. The bill would have identified the most biked streets and bridges, noted which lacked protected lanes, and demanded safety recommendations. The council filed the bill at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The bill’s failure leaves cyclists exposed, with no citywide data push to guide urgent fixes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
