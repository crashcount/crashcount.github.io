Eight seriously hurt.</strong> That is the count in Queens CB13 over the last year. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope. They only grow.</p><p>Just last week, a man tried to cross 155th Street at South Conduit Avenue. A car hit him. The driver did not stop. The man died at Jamaica Hospital. Police said, &ldquo;The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>A day before, two men stood at a food truck. A car jumped the curb and killed them both. The street was left with bodies and broken glass. A witness <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>said</a>, &ldquo;I have never seen anything like this,&rdquo; his head in his hands.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months:</strong></p><ul><li>2,505 crashes</li><li>1,813 injured</li><li>12 killed</li></ul><p>The dead do not get a second chance. The living get to wait for the next siren.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> Cars and SUVs are the main weapons: 4 killed, 339 minor injuries, 77 moderate, 6 serious. Trucks and buses killed 2, injured 27 more. Bikes hurt 2. Motorcycles and mopeds did not kill, but the numbers are small. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The old and the young are not spared.

State Senator Leroy Comrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Assembly Member Clyde Vanel voted to extend school speed zones. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>But the streets do not wait for committee votes. The carnage continues. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>said</a>, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.&rdquo; The barriers now are blood and broken bodies.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot call.

He backs lifting mandates in dense, transit-rich zones but blocks changes in car-dependent areas. Civic leaders echo him. The move keeps cars central, leaving pedestrians and cyclists exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On August 9, 2024, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards issued a public statement opposing the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity rezoning as it relates to eliminating mandatory parking requirements citywide. Richards said, "You can't use the one-size-fits-all approach here. There are really parts of Queens that are transit deserts." He supports removing parking mandates only in high-density, transit-rich areas, not in low-density, car-dependent neighborhoods. Community board leaders and civic groups in Queens joined him, arguing the reform threatens their way of life. Richards's stance contrasts with Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Bronx officials, who support ending parking minimums. The decision preserves car dominance in Queens, leaving vulnerable road users at risk and blocking safer, people-first streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Thousands of jobs vanish. Local companies lose out. Lawmakers in affected districts stay silent or cheer. Trains and buses face deep cuts. Riders, workers, and streets pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, Governor Hochul’s official pause on congestion pricing triggered a $12 billion loss in MTA contracts, according to a Reinvent Albany report. The move slashes funding for the 2020-24 MTA capital plan, which was to be partly paid by congestion pricing. The report highlights that many companies losing contracts are in districts represented by lawmakers who either support the pause or have stayed silent. Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick called congestion pricing 'simply another tax' and demanded repeal. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow praised the pause, saying it allows time to address 'communities' concerns.' Frank Russo, president of Ozone Park Lumber, warned, 'You can't just say, 'We're not going to buy supplies and equipment.'' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany said, 'Congestion pricing is an economic booster.' The pause means less money for transit, fewer jobs, and more risk for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, reliable public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group called for expanded lifeguard hours, more staff, and new public pools. The Adams administration rejected these measures, relying instead on NYPD drones and Parks Enforcement Patrols. The matter, described as 'Body found in fifth apparent drowning off NYC beach as pols call for more lifeguard hours,' highlights the deadly gap in city safety policy. Brannan, along with Council Member Shekar Krishnan and Borough Presidents Donovan Richards and Antonio Reynoso, urged the city to extend the beach season, increase lifeguard shifts, and offer universal swimming lessons. The city has only 870 lifeguards, far short of the 1,500 needed. Vulnerable swimmers remain at risk while officials debate.

Other Queens officials and residents echoed fears for single-family homeowners and suburban 'character.'
