The driver, a probationary firefighter, now faces manslaughter charges.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on March 28, 2025, that Michael Pena, a probationary FDNY firefighter, was fired after being charged with vehicular manslaughter in a Queens crash. Prosecutors said Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and struck Justin Diaz, 23, who had the right-of-way. Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly double the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The article states, 'Pena was driving nearly 60 mph above the speed limit after a night of drinking at a bar.' Surveillance footage confirmed the sequence. Two passengers in Pena's car were hospitalized. The crash highlights ongoing risks from impaired and reckless driving, even among public servants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At a community meeting, Brooks-Powers said, "We’ve been trying to get [the bike lane] removed for three years. It wasn’t supported by the community. ... In effect it’s not a bike lane quite honestly; no one uses it, they [drivers] park there. We would like to see the hard infrastructure removed." Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that building safe bike lanes requires support from local leaders. DOT spokesperson Will Livingston said the agency remains committed to safety and will explore hardening the lane and increasing enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
