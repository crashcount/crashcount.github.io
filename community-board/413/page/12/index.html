Fifteen hundred and seven injured. Seven left with wounds that will never heal. These are not numbers from a war. These are the streets of Queens CB13 since last July. The dead are not just statistics. They are neighbors. They are children, elders, workers. They are gone.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 39-year-old man was killed at 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard. He was ejected from his motorized scooter. The cause: driver inattention. His body was crushed. He died there, on the street. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On the Cross Island Parkway, a 76-year-old woman died in the back seat. The crash report lists &ldquo;unsafe lane changing.&rdquo; She did not walk away. She did not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=buses-cars-and-the-unforgiving-road>Buses, Cars, and the Unforgiving Road</h3><p>The violence is not random. Cars and SUVs did the most harm—four killed, 393 more hurt. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 25. Bikes injured two. No one was spared. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The back seat is not safe.</p><p>Last week, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb. Eight people were hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; But the video showed more. He had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said Ken Baur</a>.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-is-it-enough>Leaders Act—But Is It Enough?</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Senator Leroy Comrie voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. He co-sponsored it too. Assembly Member Clyde Vanel voted to extend school speed zones. These are good votes. They are not enough.</p><p>Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers says, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>She wants more protected bike lanes and bus lanes</a>. But the streets are still killing people.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call your state senator. Tell them: Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people walking and biking. End the carnage. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prosecutors say Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and refused a breath test. His blood-alcohol content was 0.156 percent. Surveillance footage confirmed Diaz had the right-of-way. The article notes, 'The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light, prosecutors say.' Pena was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. His license was suspended.

Pena faces charges of vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to take a breath test. Two passengers in Pena’s car were hospitalized. The FDNY suspended Pena for 28 days without pay.
