In Queens CB13, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Twenty-five people are dead. Twenty-eight more are left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 4,400 have been hurt since 2022. The crashes keep coming. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 39-year-old man was killed on Nashville Boulevard. He was ejected from his motorized scooter after an SUV turned left. The crash report lists the cause as &ldquo;driver inattention.&rdquo; The man died from crush injuries. He did not get a second chance. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On the Belt Parkway, a 27-year-old woman lost her life in February. She was driving. The car was going straight. The report says &ldquo;unsafe speed.&rdquo; She was ejected and died at the scene. Her passenger was injured. The road stayed open. The city moved on.</p><h2 id=buses-cars-and-the-human-cost>Buses, Cars, and the Human Cost</h2><p>The machines are heavy. The people are not. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm</strong>—four deaths, 397 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 27. Bikes left two with minor wounds. The numbers are cold, but the stories burn. A van crash in February killed a 78-year-old woman. She sat in the back seat. She never made it home.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The politicians talk. Some act. Senator Leroy Comrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to curb repeat speeders</a>, backing a bill to require speed-limiting devices for drivers who rack up violations. Assembly Member Clyde Vanel <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, a move to protect children on foot.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The crashes do not wait for new laws. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done enough. The streets are still wide. The cars are still fast. The bodies are still broken.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Call your assembly member.</strong> Tell them the numbers are not just numbers. They are lives. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and cycling. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

NYPD Transportation Bureau Chief Kim Royster testified, stating, "So far this year, bike lane enforcement is up 148 percent." Streetsblog fact-checked this claim and found enforcement was actually down 6.4 percent from the previous year. Royster later clarified she referred only to tickets for driving in bike lanes, a small slice of total enforcement. Combined, bike lane enforcement was still down over 4 percent. Brooks-Powers questioned enforcement against illegally parked tractor-trailers. Royster cited fine amounts but gave no enforcement numbers. Data showed code 78 and code 6 violations both dropped sharply. Royster's answers were vague, lacking specifics on enforcement or safety. The hearing exposed a gap between NYPD claims and reality, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort, not tied to a council bill, was revealed as city policy. The campaign aims to cut traffic violence through billboards and media buys. The official summary states it targets driver behavior. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, acknowledged the need for infrastructure investments over media campaigns. Jessie Singer, journalist and author, called the campaign a waste, arguing the city should focus on redesigning intersections. A recent study found similar efforts in Texas increased crash risk. The Department of Transportation could not provide evidence of effectiveness.

They need safe streets.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2022, Council Members Erik Bottcher, Rita Joseph, and Selvena Brooks-Powers introduced a resolution urging the Department of Education to teach bicycle safety in all New York City public schools. The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.' The council’s action highlights a gap between policy and real safety for children on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began.

New York State has budgeted $1.1 billion for 500 electric buses in its 2020-2024 capital plan.

New bus lanes, bike upgrades, and a linear park are coming. Officials say it will speed buses and protect walkers and cyclists. But construction lags. Riders and residents wait. Danger persists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a plan to move Q60 buses from the service road to a dedicated mainline lane along Queens Boulevard, between Roosevelt Avenue and Union Turnpike. The project, under the 'Great Streets' program, is split into four phases, with construction for later phases delayed until at least 2024. The matter summary states: 'transform the currently barren median into a linear park to create a safe and easy way of traversing neighborhoods.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards pledged $1 million to the first phase, stating, 'it really creates an unsafe scenario, especially for pedestrians and cyclists.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone said the redesign 'greatly improv[es] pedestrian safety while also drawing a huge number of new cyclists.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives called the delays 'unacceptable.' The plan includes upgraded bike lanes, bus stops, and bus-only lanes, but also adds curbside parking, which could increase congestion. Vulnerable road users remain at risk until the city acts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The violations occurred between May 2020 and April 2022. Brooks-Powers represents Southeast Queens, an area plagued by pedestrian and motorist fatalities. The matter surfaced in April 2022, with Brooks-Powers admitting responsibility for most tickets. She stated, 'public safety is very important to me,' and pledged to improve. Under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, she must complete a safety course or risk car impoundment. Her tickets have been paid, so her car was not towed. Camera tickets do not affect her license. Brooks-Powers says she is working with advocates to address traffic violence and congestion, but her record highlights the ongoing danger for vulnerable road users in her district.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, passed in 2019, aims for 250 protected bike lanes and 150 bus lanes. The Council wants to double these targets: 500 miles each of protected bike and bus lanes, plus 38 million square feet of new pedestrian plazas. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said the goal is 'to make our thoroughfares safer and more accessible, while increasing New York's pedestrian plazas footprint.' The Council’s proposal comes as the mayor’s $98.5-billion budget lacks dedicated funding for these safety upgrades. Advocates for bus and bike infrastructure support the Council’s push. The mayor says he is reviewing the proposal and remains committed to street safety and transit improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
