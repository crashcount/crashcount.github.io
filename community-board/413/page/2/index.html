Eight seriously hurt.</strong> That is the count in Queens CB13 over the last year. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope. They only grow.</p><p>Just last week, a man tried to cross 155th Street at South Conduit Avenue. A car hit him. The driver did not stop. The man died at Jamaica Hospital. Police said, &ldquo;The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>A day before, two men stood at a food truck. A car jumped the curb and killed them both. The street was left with bodies and broken glass. A witness <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>said</a>, &ldquo;I have never seen anything like this,&rdquo; his head in his hands.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months:</strong></p><ul><li>2,505 crashes</li><li>1,813 injured</li><li>12 killed</li></ul><p>The dead do not get a second chance. The living get to wait for the next siren.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> Cars and SUVs are the main weapons: 4 killed, 339 minor injuries, 77 moderate, 6 serious. Trucks and buses killed 2, injured 27 more. Bikes hurt 2. Motorcycles and mopeds did not kill, but the numbers are small. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The old and the young are not spared.

State Senator Leroy Comrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Assembly Member Clyde Vanel voted to extend school speed zones. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>But the streets do not wait for committee votes. The carnage continues. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>said</a>, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.&rdquo; The barriers now are blood and broken bodies.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot call.

The teen, unlicensed and speeding at over 100 mph in a 30-mph zone, lost control and struck a parked UPS truck. Prosecutors said he only had a learner's permit and had been previously ticketed for unlicensed driving. His parents, who gave him the BMW, were convicted of child endangerment. DA Melinda Katz called it 'a landmark case where both an unlicensed teenage driver and his parents were held responsible.' The case highlights failures in supervision and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users face tighter, riskier streets.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1339-2025, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced July 14, 2025 by Council Member Linda Lee. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to exempting ambulettes from certain bus lane restrictions and allowing them to double park to assist passengers,' lets ambulettes drive, park, and double-park in bus lanes to help passengers. Lee sponsored the bill. If passed, more vehicles will block bus lanes and sidewalks, squeezing pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s most vulnerable will face more danger at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
