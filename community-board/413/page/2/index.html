In the last twelve months, 12 people died and 1,392 were injured in crashes across Queens CB13. Eight suffered serious injuries. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons. In the past year, four people over 75 died. One was only 18. The violence does not stop for age.</p><p>Just last week, July 5, a 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of a sedan on Cross Island Parkway. Two days earlier, a 39-year-old man was killed, ejected from his scooter on Nashville Boulevard. The week before, a 26-year-old man died behind the wheel on Hillside Avenue. The list does not end. It only grows.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The stories are sharp. A BMW vaults the divider on Belt Parkway. The car catches fire. Passengers are thrown onto the road. &ldquo;They went airborne and into the barrier,&rdquo; a survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>said</a>. &ldquo;Jewel was already dead when she flew out the car,&rdquo; the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>survivor added</a>.</p><p>A bus turns on Springfield Boulevard. A crane slams into its side. Windows shatter. Riders cry out. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us,&rdquo; a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>told reporters</a>. &ldquo;The bus driver didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong,&rdquo; the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>passenger said</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have passed bills. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She has called out the Department of Transportation: &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>Brooks-Powers said</a>.</p><p>But the streets are not safe. The city has not met its own promises. The bodies keep coming. Most deaths are caused by cars and trucks. The old, the young, the careful, the unlucky. All are at risk.</p><h3 id=act-nowdemand-action>Act Now—Demand Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city stop blaming the dead and start protecting the living. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring micromobility share system operators to display rules of the road for safe operation," requires all bike and scooter share operators to show city and state road rules on their apps and at every station. Users must review these rules at least once a year before unlocking a device. Operators cannot charge for the time spent reviewing. Council Members Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (primary sponsor), Shahana K. Hanif, Gale A. Brewer, and Lincoln Restler back the measure. The bill aims to make the rules clear and visible, stripping away excuses and confusion for all riders.

Ten years of pressure forced change. The fleet stands as the most accessible in the nation. Policy, not luck, drove this. Disabled riders gain ground. Streets shift. Access grows.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on June 5, 2025, that New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) reached a milestone: 50% of active taxis are now wheelchair accessible. TLC Commissioner David Do said, “We made that today. It is the most accessible fleet in the entire country.” This achievement follows a decade-long push by disability advocates and a 2013 settlement requiring half the medallion fleet to be accessible. The transition faced delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic and medallion owner financial struggles. Policy changes, such as alternating accessible vehicles and funding support, drove the shift. The article highlights systemic progress, not individual driver actions, and underscores the impact of sustained advocacy and regulatory pressure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Federal Secretary Duffy objects. Critics say his stance ignores history and safety. The bridge once belonged to walkers. Now, the city returns space to people, not cars. Tensions flare. Vulnerable users watch.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the Adams administration's move to open a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge. The event, not a council bill but a city action, drew sharp criticism from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who opposed removing a vehicle lane for pedestrians and cyclists. The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.' Still, the move restores space to those on foot and bike, challenging car dominance and federal resistance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
