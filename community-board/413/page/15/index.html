In Queens CB13, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Twenty-five people are dead. Twenty-eight more are left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 4,400 have been hurt since 2022. The crashes keep coming. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 39-year-old man was killed on Nashville Boulevard. He was ejected from his motorized scooter after an SUV turned left. The crash report lists the cause as &ldquo;driver inattention.&rdquo; The man died from crush injuries. He did not get a second chance. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On the Belt Parkway, a 27-year-old woman lost her life in February. She was driving. The car was going straight. The report says &ldquo;unsafe speed.&rdquo; She was ejected and died at the scene. Her passenger was injured. The road stayed open. The city moved on.</p><h2 id=buses-cars-and-the-human-cost>Buses, Cars, and the Human Cost</h2><p>The machines are heavy. The people are not. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm</strong>—four deaths, 397 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 27. Bikes left two with minor wounds. The numbers are cold, but the stories burn. A van crash in February killed a 78-year-old woman. She sat in the back seat. She never made it home.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The politicians talk. Some act. Senator Leroy Comrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to curb repeat speeders</a>, backing a bill to require speed-limiting devices for drivers who rack up violations. Assembly Member Clyde Vanel <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, a move to protect children on foot.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The crashes do not wait for new laws. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done enough. The streets are still wide. The cars are still fast. The bodies are still broken.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Call your assembly member.</strong> Tell them the numbers are not just numbers. They are lives. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and cycling. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brooks-Powers</p><p class=mb3>On January 22, 2025, Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confronted the Department of Transportation at a public hearing. She cited DOT's repeated failure to meet the 2019 Streets Master Plan benchmarks—50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles of bus lanes and 25.7 miles of bike lanes. Brooks-Powers introduced Intro 1105, a bill requiring DOT to publish a tracker of its progress. She declared, "DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results." DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione objected, claiming the tracker would add paperwork and reduce community engagement. Brooks-Powers countered, "DOT needs to be more transparent about its project pipeline so we can identify bottlenecks." The committee signaled intent to advance the bill. The city’s failure leaves pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred in the dark, with no crosswalk or signal present at the location. The report states the driver was distracted, citing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The woman suffered severe bleeding from her leg but remained conscious at the scene. The driver did not stop after the collision. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing where there was no signal or crosswalk, but the police report lists driver distraction as the key factor in the crash. The focus remains on the driver's inattention and the systemic dangers faced by those crossing city streets outside of marked crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
