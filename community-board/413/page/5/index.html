Surveillance video showed Servedio "went flying off her bicycle and slammed into a parked BMW while Fiseku sped off." Police ended their pursuit to help Servedio, who died at Elmhurst Hospital. Fiseku was on supervised release for a prior federal conviction at the time. The article highlights that Fiseku had three passengers and was fleeing police, raising questions about police pursuit protocols and the risks to vulnerable road users.
