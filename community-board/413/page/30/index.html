In the last twelve months, 12 people died and 1,392 were injured in crashes across Queens CB13. Eight suffered serious injuries. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons. In the past year, four people over 75 died. One was only 18. The violence does not stop for age.</p><p>Just last week, July 5, a 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of a sedan on Cross Island Parkway. Two days earlier, a 39-year-old man was killed, ejected from his scooter on Nashville Boulevard. The week before, a 26-year-old man died behind the wheel on Hillside Avenue. The list does not end. It only grows.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The stories are sharp. A BMW vaults the divider on Belt Parkway. The car catches fire. Passengers are thrown onto the road. &ldquo;They went airborne and into the barrier,&rdquo; a survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>said</a>. &ldquo;Jewel was already dead when she flew out the car,&rdquo; the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>survivor added</a>.</p><p>A bus turns on Springfield Boulevard. A crane slams into its side. Windows shatter. Riders cry out. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us,&rdquo; a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>told reporters</a>. &ldquo;The bus driver didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong,&rdquo; the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>passenger said</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have passed bills. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She has called out the Department of Transportation: &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>Brooks-Powers said</a>.</p><p>But the streets are not safe. The city has not met its own promises. The bodies keep coming. Most deaths are caused by cars and trucks. The old, the young, the careful, the unlucky. All are at risk.</p><h3 id=act-nowdemand-action>Act Now—Demand Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city stop blaming the dead and start protecting the living. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution, led by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, is a required step before state passage. Brooks-Powers had withheld support until the bill included street redesigns for safety, especially in low-income communities of color. She said, 'Lowering speed limits works best when paired with traffic calming and street safety infrastructure.' The resolution now has 23 co-sponsors, three short of a majority. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver. Last year, the Council failed to pass a home rule message under Speaker Adams.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects. While it aims to protect emergency access, advocates warn it could delay or block street redesigns that save lives for people walking and biking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill failed to enter the 2023 state budget, shifting responsibility to the City Council. In 2021, the Council backed a home rule message 42-6, but the Assembly blocked it. Last year, the Council reversed course and failed to pass the message. This session, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, with 10 sponsors. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers must hold a hearing before a vote. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Brooks-Powers have not signed on, citing negotiations. The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.' Data show slower speeds save lives. Advocates and victims’ families keep pushing.

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), committee chair, sponsored the bill. The measure requires the Department of Transportation to study daylighting—removing parking near corners to improve visibility—and then install it at 100 intersections each year starting in 2025. The bill’s matter title: 'The Department of Transportation must study the safety benefits of 'daylighting' and implement the street safety measure that helps improve visibility at a minimum of 100 intersections each year.' Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez initially objected, citing concerns about driver speed, but supported the amended bill requiring physical barriers. The law comes after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a non-daylighted intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The session included Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, who supported the measures. The bills, as summarized, would require the Department of Transportation to create pedestrian zones for seniors, install traffic calming devices, increase the frequency of serious crash studies, and implement 'daylighting'—removing parking near intersections—at 100 sites starting January 1, 2025. The matter title reads: 'NYC Council tackles bills on policing, homeless rights and charity gambling.' Narcisse is listed as a sponsor. These actions aim to cut risk for pedestrians and seniors, especially at dangerous crossings. The council’s stance is clear: support for pedestrian safety zones, traffic calming, more crash studies, and daylighting. The vote signals a push for systemic change on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
