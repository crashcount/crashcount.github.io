Nine seriously injured.</strong> In the last year alone, Queens CB13 saw 1,413 people hurt in 1,970 crashes. Five lives ended since January. Three were over 75. The youngest was 25. Each number is a name, a family, a hole in the world.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A 78-year-old man tried to cross Jericho Turnpike. He never made it. The driver who struck him was charged months later with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. He got a desk appearance ticket. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>&ldquo;A driver has been arrested five months after fatally striking a 78-year-old man crossing a heavily traveled Queens intersection, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A woman in her 70s rode in a minivan from a senior home. The van veered off Brookville Boulevard and hit a tree. She died in the back seat. Three others, all seniors, survived. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/14/woman-killed-3-hurt-in-senior-residence-minivan-crash/>&ldquo;A woman was killed and three other people were hospitalized when a trip from a Queens senior residential home turned deadly early Friday, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs took four lives and left six with serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed two. No cyclist killed anyone. No moped. No bike. The most vulnerable—seniors, children, people on foot—pay the price for someone else’s speed or inattention.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h2><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras run 24/7. The law allows lower speed limits. But in Queens CB13, the carnage continues. Charges come late, if at all. The streets do not forgive delay. Every day of inaction is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</strong></h2><p><strong>Contact your council member. Demand lower speed limits and more street redesigns.</strong> Ask why drivers who kill walk free. Tell them the numbers are not just numbers. They are neighbors. They are you. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The sedan driver, a 26-year-old male occupant, sustained neck injuries described as whiplash but remained conscious and restrained by a lap belt and harness. Contributing factors listed include "Other Vehicular" and "Passenger Distraction." The report notes no ejection and no unspecified additional driver errors. The crash resulted in injury to the sedan driver, with damage focused on the point of impact on both vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.'

The measure requires the Department of Transportation to study daylighting—removing parking near corners to improve visibility—and then install it at 100 intersections each year starting in 2025. The bill’s matter title: 'The Department of Transportation must study the safety benefits of 'daylighting' and implement the street safety measure that helps improve visibility at a minimum of 100 intersections each year.' Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez initially objected, citing concerns about driver speed, but supported the amended bill requiring physical barriers. The law comes after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a non-daylighted intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Measures target deadly corners, reckless speed, and senior danger. Daylighting, crash studies, and pedestrian zones all on the table. Narcisse backed the push. Streets remain hostile. Lawmakers act. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 27, 2023, the City Council committee voted on several transportation safety bills. The session included Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, who supported the measures. The bills, as summarized, would require the Department of Transportation to create pedestrian zones for seniors, install traffic calming devices, increase the frequency of serious crash studies, and implement 'daylighting'—removing parking near intersections—at 100 sites starting January 1, 2025. The matter title reads: 'NYC Council tackles bills on policing, homeless rights and charity gambling.' Narcisse is listed as a sponsor. These actions aim to cut risk for pedestrians and seniors, especially at dangerous crossings. The council’s stance is clear: support for pedestrian safety zones, traffic calming, more crash studies, and daylighting. The vote signals a push for systemic change on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
