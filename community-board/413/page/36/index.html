Since 2022, 25 people have died in crashes. 4,440 have been injured. 28 suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers do not tell you about the silence after the sirens. They do not show the blood on the curb, or the shoes left behind.</p><p>Just last month, a man on a motorized scooter was killed at the corner of 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard. He was ejected and crushed. The cause: unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). In February, a 27-year-old woman was killed on the Belt Parkway. She was ejected from her car. The cause: unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. They killed 4, injured 387, and left 6 with serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed 2 and injured 25. Bikes caused 2 minor injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds did not kill or seriously injure anyone in this period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Leroy Comrie voted yes to the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the law (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>). Others have backed the extension of school speed zones (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>school speed zones</a>). But the carnage continues. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>said</a>, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.&rdquo; The barriers remain. The deaths remain.</p><h2 id=the-call-no-one-wants-to-make>The Call No One Wants to Make</h2><p>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The state has the power to rein in repeat offenders. The people have the power to demand more. Call your council member. Call your senator. Call the mayor. Tell them: Enough. Lower the speed.

The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.'

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), committee chair, sponsored the bill. The measure requires the Department of Transportation to study daylighting—removing parking near corners to improve visibility—and then install it at 100 intersections each year starting in 2025. The bill’s matter title: 'The Department of Transportation must study the safety benefits of 'daylighting' and implement the street safety measure that helps improve visibility at a minimum of 100 intersections each year.' Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez initially objected, citing concerns about driver speed, but supported the amended bill requiring physical barriers. The law comes after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a non-daylighted intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She opposes Intro. 501, a bill that would let citizens report blocked bike lanes, preferring more NYPD and automated camera enforcement. Brooks-Powers said, "communities want to have input on where these assets are going," and criticized DOT’s community engagement.

The session included Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, who supported the measures. The bills, as summarized, would require the Department of Transportation to create pedestrian zones for seniors, install traffic calming devices, increase the frequency of serious crash studies, and implement 'daylighting'—removing parking near intersections—at 100 sites starting January 1, 2025. The matter title reads: 'NYC Council tackles bills on policing, homeless rights and charity gambling.' Narcisse is listed as a sponsor. These actions aim to cut risk for pedestrians and seniors, especially at dangerous crossings. The council’s stance is clear: support for pedestrian safety zones, traffic calming, more crash studies, and daylighting. The vote signals a push for systemic change on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said his agency is open to talks after earlier resistance. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, committee chair, voiced concerns about public conflict. Restler insisted, 'People are dying on our streets. This will save lives.' Advocates remain divided.
