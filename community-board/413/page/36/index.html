In the last twelve months, 12 people died and 1,392 were injured in crashes across Queens CB13. Eight suffered serious injuries. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons. In the past year, four people over 75 died. One was only 18. The violence does not stop for age.</p><p>Just last week, July 5, a 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of a sedan on Cross Island Parkway. Two days earlier, a 39-year-old man was killed, ejected from his scooter on Nashville Boulevard. The week before, a 26-year-old man died behind the wheel on Hillside Avenue. The list does not end. It only grows.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The stories are sharp. A BMW vaults the divider on Belt Parkway. The car catches fire. Passengers are thrown onto the road. &ldquo;They went airborne and into the barrier,&rdquo; a survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>said</a>. &ldquo;Jewel was already dead when she flew out the car,&rdquo; the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>survivor added</a>.</p><p>A bus turns on Springfield Boulevard. A crane slams into its side. Windows shatter. Riders cry out. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us,&rdquo; a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>told reporters</a>. &ldquo;The bus driver didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong,&rdquo; the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>passenger said</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have passed bills. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She has called out the Department of Transportation: &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>Brooks-Powers said</a>.</p><p>But the streets are not safe. The city has not met its own promises. The bodies keep coming. Most deaths are caused by cars and trucks. The old, the young, the careful, the unlucky. All are at risk.</p><h3 id=act-nowdemand-action>Act Now—Demand Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city stop blaming the dead and start protecting the living. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT offers no timeline.</p><p class=mb3>On November 11, 2022, Councilmember Rita Joseph (District 40) issued a public letter to the Department of Transportation, demanding answers for the slow pace of speed hump installations. The matter, titled "#StuckAtDOT: It Takes Years (and Years) to Get a Speed Hump in this City," details Joseph’s frustration: 'In response to a speed hump request, my office was informed by the DOT that...studies are finalized after two years.' Joseph listed twelve locations needing speed humps; only one was approved, none installed. Eight were denied, several remain under review. Her district saw 1,173 crashes this year, injuring 87 cyclists and 141 pedestrians. Joseph, who lost students to traffic violence, calls the delay 'unacceptable.' DOT says it is reviewing her letter. Advocates demand faster action, saying, 'It should never take two years to implement these straight-forward safety measures.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The editorial, titled 'Hey, Donovan Richards: It’s actually way more racist to FAVOR congestion pricing,' criticized Queens Borough President Donovan Richards for labeling Holden’s opposition as racist. The piece argued, 'congestion pricing would be a disaster,' claiming it would harm diverse outer-borough residents and worsen air quality in The Bronx by diverting diesel trucks. The editorial cited MTA studies predicting only a 3.1% reduction in Manhattan traffic and framed the plan as an unfair tax on commerce. Holden’s stance reflects ongoing resistance to congestion pricing in the council, with equity and environmental impacts at the center of the debate.

Sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, the bill is advancing in the City Council with 24 out of 51 members signed on as of November 7, 2022. It sits with the Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, who is working with Restler to streamline the complaint process. The bill’s summary: it allows residents to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or fire hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school, creating a $175 fine and a civilian complaint protocol. Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation. The NYPD and DOT oppose the bill, citing concerns about neighbor conflict. Advocates support it, highlighting NYPD’s failure to protect vulnerable road users. The bill is seen as a major improvement over the ineffective 311 system.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible.
