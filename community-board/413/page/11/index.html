They only grow.</p><p>Just last week, a man tried to cross 155th Street at South Conduit Avenue. A car hit him. The driver did not stop. The man died at Jamaica Hospital.

The incident began with a minor collision and escalated as both vehicles ran a red light. Helmet cam footage showed Rosen rear-ending the motorcycle, causing it to catch fire and kill McField instantly. Queens DA Melinda Katz stated, "As alleged, this defendant plowed his BMW SUV into a motorcyclist shortly after the two had a minor collision." The BMW also struck another car before stopping. Rosen had prior traffic summonses for speeding and driving the wrong way. The case highlights the lethal risk of aggressive driving and the deadly power imbalance between cars and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates demand better maintenance and real transportation focus.</p><p class=mb3>On April 24, 2025, the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation faced backlash for policies affecting key bike infrastructure. The department banned bikes from a major stretch of the Rockaway Boardwalk, closed parts of the Hudson River Greenway, and allowed cars back into Silver Lake Park. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, speaking for local families, condemned the boardwalk ban: "It was about the children that take advantage of biking on the boardwalk...We’re now shifting them into the street." Residents and advocates argue these moves ignore years of complaints about poor maintenance and lack of coordination with DOT. They highlight that car-free conditions in Silver Lake Park improved safety, especially for children. Advocates call for shifting road maintenance from Parks to DOT and demand structural changes. The Parks Department’s focus on recreation, not transportation, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, the City Council debated a new bill to bring back year-round roadway dining. The measure, still in committee, follows the 2023 law that limited outdoor dining to April through November. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) leads the charge, calling the current law a 'failure' that 'prioritized parking spots over vibrant streets.' Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Lawmakers and advocates agree: high costs, bureaucracy, and seasonality block participation and hurt street life. The bill's fate remains undecided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors revealed Pena had '25 tickets for speeding in school zones' in recent years. Surveillance showed both cars spinning out after the crash; Diaz died at Elmhurst Hospital. Pena tested positive for cocaine, marijuana, and had a blood-alcohol content of 0.156%. He faces 14 charges, including manslaughter and DWI. Diaz’s family called for stronger laws, with his mother stating, 'They need to look at the laws and see that people need to be charged accordingly.' Pena’s license was suspended and he was remanded to Rikers.

Both bills require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create public trackers for capital projects tied to the Streets Master Plan. Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.
