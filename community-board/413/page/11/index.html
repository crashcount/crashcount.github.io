Since 2022, 25 people have died in crashes. 4,440 have been injured. 28 suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers do not tell you about the silence after the sirens. They do not show the blood on the curb, or the shoes left behind.</p><p>Just last month, a man on a motorized scooter was killed at the corner of 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard. He was ejected and crushed. The cause: unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). In February, a 27-year-old woman was killed on the Belt Parkway. She was ejected from her car. The cause: unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. They killed 4, injured 387, and left 6 with serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed 2 and injured 25. Bikes caused 2 minor injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds did not kill or seriously injure anyone in this period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Leroy Comrie voted yes to the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the law (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>). Others have backed the extension of school speed zones (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>school speed zones</a>). But the carnage continues. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>said</a>, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.&rdquo; The barriers remain. The deaths remain.</p><h2 id=the-call-no-one-wants-to-make>The Call No One Wants to Make</h2><p>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The state has the power to rein in repeat offenders. The people have the power to demand more. Call your council member. Call your senator. Call the mayor. Tell them: Enough. Lower the speed.

They warned, 'The limited funding and decreases in funding that have occurred over the years jeopardize the continuity and future of the program—funding pressure is already leading to downsizing and the disappearance of Open Streets programs.' The groups seek $48 million over three years, separate from the city’s $30 million contract with the Horticultural Society. Current grants max out at $20,000 per year, forcing cutbacks. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams are starting budget talks. Council spokesperson Julia Agos called Open Streets 'critical components of our city's public realm.' The Department of Transportation said suggestions will be reviewed.
