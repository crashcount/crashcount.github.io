In Queens CB13, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Twenty-five people are dead. Twenty-eight more are left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 4,400 have been hurt since 2022. The crashes keep coming. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 39-year-old man was killed on Nashville Boulevard. He was ejected from his motorized scooter after an SUV turned left. The crash report lists the cause as &ldquo;driver inattention.&rdquo; The man died from crush injuries. He did not get a second chance. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On the Belt Parkway, a 27-year-old woman lost her life in February. She was driving. The car was going straight. The report says &ldquo;unsafe speed.&rdquo; She was ejected and died at the scene. Her passenger was injured. The road stayed open. The city moved on.</p><h2 id=buses-cars-and-the-human-cost>Buses, Cars, and the Human Cost</h2><p>The machines are heavy. The people are not. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm</strong>—four deaths, 397 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two, injured 27. Bikes left two with minor wounds. The numbers are cold, but the stories burn. A van crash in February killed a 78-year-old woman. She sat in the back seat. She never made it home.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The politicians talk. Some act. Senator Leroy Comrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to curb repeat speeders</a>, backing a bill to require speed-limiting devices for drivers who rack up violations. Assembly Member Clyde Vanel <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, a move to protect children on foot.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The crashes do not wait for new laws. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done enough. The streets are still wide. The cars are still fast. The bodies are still broken.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Call your assembly member.</strong> Tell them the numbers are not just numbers. They are lives. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and cycling. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

At a community meeting, Brooks-Powers said, "We’ve been trying to get [the bike lane] removed for three years. It wasn’t supported by the community. ... In effect it’s not a bike lane quite honestly; no one uses it, they [drivers] park there. We would like to see the hard infrastructure removed." Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that building safe bike lanes requires support from local leaders. DOT spokesperson Will Livingston said the agency remains committed to safety and will explore hardening the lane and increasing enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
