Nine seriously injured.</strong> In the last year alone, Queens CB13 saw 1,413 people hurt in 1,970 crashes. Five lives ended since January. Three were over 75. The youngest was 25. Each number is a name, a family, a hole in the world.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A 78-year-old man tried to cross Jericho Turnpike. He never made it. The driver who struck him was charged months later with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. He got a desk appearance ticket. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>&ldquo;A driver has been arrested five months after fatally striking a 78-year-old man crossing a heavily traveled Queens intersection, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A woman in her 70s rode in a minivan from a senior home. The van veered off Brookville Boulevard and hit a tree. She died in the back seat. Three others, all seniors, survived. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/14/woman-killed-3-hurt-in-senior-residence-minivan-crash/>&ldquo;A woman was killed and three other people were hospitalized when a trip from a Queens senior residential home turned deadly early Friday, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs took four lives and left six with serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed two. No cyclist killed anyone. No moped. No bike. The most vulnerable—seniors, children, people on foot—pay the price for someone else’s speed or inattention.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h2><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras run 24/7. The law allows lower speed limits. But in Queens CB13, the carnage continues. Charges come late, if at all. The streets do not forgive delay. Every day of inaction is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</strong></h2><p><strong>Contact your council member. Demand lower speed limits and more street redesigns.</strong> Ask why drivers who kill walk free. Tell them the numbers are not just numbers. They are neighbors. They are you. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, the City Council debated a new bill to bring back year-round roadway dining. The measure, still in committee, follows the 2023 law that limited outdoor dining to April through November. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) leads the charge, calling the current law a 'failure' that 'prioritized parking spots over vibrant streets.' Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Lawmakers and advocates agree: high costs, bureaucracy, and seasonality block participation and hurt street life. The bill's fate remains undecided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield.

Both bills require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create public trackers for capital projects tied to the Streets Master Plan. Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.
