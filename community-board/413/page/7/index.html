Twenty-nine seriously hurt.</strong> Four thousand more injured since 2022. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, July 5th, a BMW hit a divider on the Belt Parkway.</strong> It vaulted into oncoming traffic. Two young lives ended. The car burned. Police said, &ldquo;No one in the doomed BMW was wearing a seat belt&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>NY Daily News</a>). Three others survived. The road was closed for hours. The scars will last longer.</p><p>On June 26th, a man riding a motorized scooter on Nashville Boulevard was killed. The crash report lists &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction.&rdquo; He was ejected. He died there. Another number. Another family left behind (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-streets-are-not-safe>The Streets Are Not Safe</h3><p><strong>Most of the dead are not drivers.</strong> They are passengers, walkers, riders. The old and the young. Four children under 18 have died here since 2022. Four more over 75. The city calls them accidents. But the pattern is clear. Unsafe speeds. Lane changes. Distraction. The same mistakes, over and over.</p><p>A bus crash in Queens Village left four hurt. Emily McKinnon was on board. &ldquo;I was holding on for my life back there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The bus driver didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong&mldr; then the crane just hits us&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>ABC7</a>).</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders Talk.

She has voted to legalize jaywalking, to collect micromobility data, to lower speed limits on Open Streets. She co-sponsored bills for better lighting, more speed humps, and safer crossings. But the deaths keep coming. Promises do not stop cars.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign deadly roads. It can end the reign of repeat speeders. But it will not act unless you force it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking.</strong> Do not wait for the next siren. The next name. The next number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license. The case highlights the lethal risk of unlicensed driving and the dangers of stopped vehicles on high-speed roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
