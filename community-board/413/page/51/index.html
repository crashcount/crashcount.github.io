Eight seriously hurt.</strong> That is the count in Queens CB13 over the last year. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope. They only grow.</p><p>Just last week, a man tried to cross 155th Street at South Conduit Avenue. A car hit him. The driver did not stop. The man died at Jamaica Hospital. Police said, &ldquo;The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>A day before, two men stood at a food truck. A car jumped the curb and killed them both. The street was left with bodies and broken glass. A witness <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>said</a>, &ldquo;I have never seen anything like this,&rdquo; his head in his hands.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months:</strong></p><ul><li>2,505 crashes</li><li>1,813 injured</li><li>12 killed</li></ul><p>The dead do not get a second chance.

Trucks and buses killed 2, injured 27 more. Bikes hurt 2. Motorcycles and mopeds did not kill, but the numbers are small. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The old and the young are not spared.

State Senator Leroy Comrie <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. Assembly Member Clyde Vanel voted to extend school speed zones. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>But the streets do not wait for committee votes. The carnage continues. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>said</a>, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.&rdquo; The barriers now are blood and broken bodies.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot call.

Calls for urgent change rose.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2022, a driver in an SUV killed a 10-year-old girl and injured a woman on a Queens sidewalk after speeding out of a grocery store parking lot. The incident, described as 'another child on a sidewalk in Far Rockaway,' drew swift condemnation. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards called the crash a wake-up call, saying, 'There is nothing more imperative than street safety.' Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called the deaths 'senseless' and blamed years of underinvestment and neglect. She pledged to work with Mayor Adams to address transportation inequities and ensure safer streets. The crash highlighted the danger of parking lot exits that funnel cars onto sidewalks and the rise in pedestrian deaths involving SUVs. Advocates demanded proven solutions to slow drivers and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>A final analysis released January 26, 2022, revealed 2021 as the deadliest year in the eight-year history of New York City's Vision Zero initiative, with 273 road deaths—a 32 percent jump from 2018. The Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, faces mounting pressure. The matter summary states: 'A final analysis of 2021 crash statistics revealed that it was the deadliest year in the eight-year history of New York City's Vision Zero initiative.' Transportation Alternatives demanded urgent action: reclaiming street space from cars, redesigning intersections, upgrading bike lanes, and more. Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez pledged intersection redesigns and stronger bike lanes, but no changes have rolled out. Brooks-Powers called every death 'an avoidable tragedy' and vowed to push for safer streets. The city stands at a crossroads.

Leroy Comrie slammed calls for more congestion pricing exemptions. He warned that carving out special breaks guts the plan’s purpose. Comrie said every exemption means less money for transit. He wants the city to hold the line. No more carve-outs.</p><p class=mb3>On January 19, 2022, State Sen. Leroy Comrie, chair of the MTA committee, spoke at a legislative hearing on congestion pricing exemptions. The hearing addressed whether to grant more carve-outs to Manhattan’s congestion tolls. Comrie declared, 'I don't think there should be any exemptions, and I'm going to continue to say that there should be no exemptions.' He pushed back against senators seeking discounts for suburban drivers and city workers. Comrie warned that opening the door to more exemptions would undermine the law’s intent and threaten revenue for transit. He said, 'Once you open up that can of worms, you create major problems, because everybody wants to be exempted for something.' Comrie’s stance: keep the plan strict, protect transit funding, and don’t weaken congestion pricing with special favors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
