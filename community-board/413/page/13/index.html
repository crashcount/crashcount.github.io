The city’s inaction puts public space and safety at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2025, a coalition of 16 volunteer open street groups sent a letter to City Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers. They warned, 'The limited funding and decreases in funding that have occurred over the years jeopardize the continuity and future of the program—funding pressure is already leading to downsizing and the disappearance of Open Streets programs.' The groups seek $48 million over three years, separate from the city’s $30 million contract with the Horticultural Society. Current grants max out at $20,000 per year, forcing cutbacks. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams are starting budget talks. Council spokesperson Julia Agos called Open Streets 'critical components of our city's public realm.' The Department of Transportation said suggestions will be reviewed. Volunteer groups handle most operations, but stalled redesigns and lack of resources threaten the program’s survival.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
