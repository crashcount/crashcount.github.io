Nine seriously injured.</strong> In the last year alone, Queens CB13 saw 1,413 people hurt in 1,970 crashes. Five lives ended since January. Three were over 75. The youngest was 25. Each number is a name, a family, a hole in the world.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A 78-year-old man tried to cross Jericho Turnpike. He never made it. The driver who struck him was charged months later with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. He got a desk appearance ticket. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>&ldquo;A driver has been arrested five months after fatally striking a 78-year-old man crossing a heavily traveled Queens intersection, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A woman in her 70s rode in a minivan from a senior home.

Trucks and buses killed two. No cyclist killed anyone. No moped. No bike. The most vulnerable—seniors, children, people on foot—pay the price for someone else’s speed or inattention.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h2><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras run 24/7. The law allows lower speed limits. But in Queens CB13, the carnage continues. Charges come late, if at all. The streets do not forgive delay. Every day of inaction is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</strong></h2><p><strong>Contact your council member. Demand lower speed limits and more street redesigns.</strong> Ask why drivers who kill walk free. Tell them the numbers are not just numbers. They are neighbors. They are you. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The violations occurred in Southeast Queens, an area with high pedestrian and motorist injury rates. Under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, Brooks-Powers must take a safety course or risk her car being impounded. She admitted responsibility, expressed remorse, and pledged to improve her driving, stating, 'I absolutely pledge to do better as public safety is very important to me.' All tickets have been paid, so her car has not been towed. The article notes that camera-issued tickets do not affect a driver's license. Brooks-Powers has advocated for pedestrian safety and bus accessibility, but her driving record highlights the ongoing danger on streets not designed for safety, especially in communities of color.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began. The mayor’s proposed $98.5-billion budget did not allocate significant funds for the plan. Advocates say the city must act now to stem the bloodshed on its streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The new vehicles will be deployed to six depots across all five boroughs, focusing on 'environmental justice communities' with high asthma rates. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said, 'Fully electrifying our bus fleet is a critical step forward to preserving our environment and protecting our families.' MTA Chairman Janno Lieber called mass transit 'the antidote to climate change.' The rollout, however, is slow. High electricity costs and limited charging infrastructure stall progress. New York State has budgeted $1.1 billion for 500 electric buses in its 2020-2024 capital plan. The MTA aims for a zero-emissions fleet by 2040, but today’s step is small—just 1% of the fleet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger persists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a plan to move Q60 buses from the service road to a dedicated mainline lane along Queens Boulevard, between Roosevelt Avenue and Union Turnpike. The project, under the 'Great Streets' program, is split into four phases, with construction for later phases delayed until at least 2024. The matter summary states: 'transform the currently barren median into a linear park to create a safe and easy way of traversing neighborhoods.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards pledged $1 million to the first phase, stating, 'it really creates an unsafe scenario, especially for pedestrians and cyclists.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone said the redesign 'greatly improv[es] pedestrian safety while also drawing a huge number of new cyclists.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives called the delays 'unacceptable.' The plan includes upgraded bike lanes, bus stops, and bus-only lanes, but also adds curbside parking, which could increase congestion. Vulnerable road users remain at risk until the city acts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, passed in 2019, aims for 250 protected bike lanes and 150 bus lanes. The Council wants to double these targets: 500 miles each of protected bike and bus lanes, plus 38 million square feet of new pedestrian plazas. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said the goal is 'to make our thoroughfares safer and more accessible, while increasing New York's pedestrian plazas footprint.' The Council’s proposal comes as the mayor’s $98.5-billion budget lacks dedicated funding for these safety upgrades. Advocates for bus and bike infrastructure support the Council’s push. The mayor says he is reviewing the proposal and remains committed to street safety and transit improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Richards</p><p class=mb3>On March 30, 2022, the MTA released a second draft of its Queens bus network redesign. The plan, not tied to a bill number, is a policy proposal under review. It follows backlash to the 2019 draft and pandemic delays. The redesign boosts routes from 77 to 85, adds 20 new lines, and drops the revenue-neutral rule. Hundreds of stops will be cut to speed service. The MTA and NYC DOT picked 49 corridors for upgrades like bus lanes. The official summary states the plan 'incorporates feedback from over 11,000 customer comments and aims to address previous criticisms.' MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'We know we need to get it right this time.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and advocates like Riders Alliance back the effort but call for more equity and engagement.
