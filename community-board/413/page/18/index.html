Nine seriously injured.</strong> In the last year alone, Queens CB13 saw 1,413 people hurt in 1,970 crashes. Five lives ended since January. Three were over 75. The youngest was 25. Each number is a name, a family, a hole in the world.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A 78-year-old man tried to cross Jericho Turnpike. He never made it. The driver who struck him was charged months later with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. He got a desk appearance ticket. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>&ldquo;A driver has been arrested five months after fatally striking a 78-year-old man crossing a heavily traveled Queens intersection, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A woman in her 70s rode in a minivan from a senior home. The van veered off Brookville Boulevard and hit a tree. She died in the back seat. Three others, all seniors, survived. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/14/woman-killed-3-hurt-in-senior-residence-minivan-crash/>&ldquo;A woman was killed and three other people were hospitalized when a trip from a Queens senior residential home turned deadly early Friday, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs took four lives and left six with serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed two. No cyclist killed anyone. No moped. No bike. The most vulnerable—seniors, children, people on foot—pay the price for someone else’s speed or inattention.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h2><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras run 24/7. The law allows lower speed limits. But in Queens CB13, the carnage continues. Charges come late, if at all. The streets do not forgive delay. Every day of inaction is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</strong></h2><p><strong>Contact your council member. Demand lower speed limits and more street redesigns.</strong> Ask why drivers who kill walk free. Tell them the numbers are not just numbers. They are neighbors. They are you. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

This follows Mayor Adams’s earlier $35 million commitment. The matter centers on whether to build a park or restore rail service—"Its purpose is to derail the train," said Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director. City Hall, represented by spokesperson Charles Lutvak, insists, "The proposed Met Hub does not preclude an MTA project if [MTA officials] determine one is feasible." Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi echoed, "Those two don't directly conflict." State Sen. James Sanders Jr. continues to push for QueensLink funding. The city’s investments so far favor the park, leaving the rail proposal in limbo.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to establish a program to allow community centers, schools, arts and cultural institutions and religious institutions to use adjacent outdoor spaces," would force DOT to create a permit program for these groups.
