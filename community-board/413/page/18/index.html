Introduced March 7, 2024, it urges Albany to pass and sign a law creating unlimited subway and bus transfers within two hours for pay-per-ride users. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation, which would create unlimited transfers within the two-hour period of paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority subway or bus fare for pay-per-ride users.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez leads as primary sponsor, joined by Riley, Stevens, Hanif, Won, Feliz, Salaam, Hanks, Farías, De La Rosa, Cabán, Williams, Hudson, Ung, Ossé, Banks, and Holden. The sponsors argue the current one-transfer rule hits hardest for riders with long, complex trips, often in transit deserts. They demand fare equity for all, not just those with short, easy rides.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Action is pending.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0060-2024 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced February 28, 2024, by Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor, District 39) and Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (co-sponsor, District 31). The measure urges the State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would mandate scramble crosswalks at school entrances during arrival and dismissal. The resolution states: 'establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' The council cites a surge in crashes near schools and the loss of 486 crossing guards. The bill highlights that intersections are the site of most pedestrian deaths and injuries. The sponsors call for action to protect children where cars and kids meet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sits in committee. Streets stay dark. Pedestrians wait. The city promises a study. Lawmakers push for light, but action lags. Danger remains while the council debates.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0301-2024, introduced February 28, 2024, sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, status: Laid Over in Committee. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks,' orders the Department of Transportation to install at least 100 illuminated, solar-powered traffic control devices at crosswalks each year for five years—a total of 500. The department must also study their impact compared to unlit signs. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, Won, Narcisse, Hanks, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Hudson, Schulman, and Avilés. The bill was laid over by committee on June 25, 2024. No safety analyst note was provided. Vulnerable road users remain exposed while the city delays action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
