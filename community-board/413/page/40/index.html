Since 2022, 25 people have died in crashes. 4,440 have been injured. 28 suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers do not tell you about the silence after the sirens. They do not show the blood on the curb, or the shoes left behind.</p><p>Just last month, a man on a motorized scooter was killed at the corner of 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard. He was ejected and crushed. The cause: unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). In February, a 27-year-old woman was killed on the Belt Parkway. She was ejected from her car. The cause: unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. They killed 4, injured 387, and left 6 with serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed 2 and injured 25. Bikes caused 2 minor injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds did not kill or seriously injure anyone in this period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Leroy Comrie voted yes to the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the law (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>). Others have backed the extension of school speed zones (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>school speed zones</a>). But the carnage continues. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/20/meet-the-councils-transportation-committee-chair-selvena-brooks-powers>said</a>, &ldquo;Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.&rdquo; The barriers remain. The deaths remain.</p><h2 id=the-call-no-one-wants-to-make>The Call No One Wants to Make</h2><p>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The state has the power to rein in repeat offenders. The people have the power to demand more. Call your council member. Call your senator. Call the mayor. Tell them: Enough. Lower the speed.

Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers did not comment. Adams claims fiscal discipline is key, despite calling Fair Fares 'transformative.' The program’s strict eligibility leaves out many struggling New Yorkers.

Brooks-Powers led a resolution supporting commuter vans and spoke on transportation equity, but did not advance key street safety or Vision Zero legislation. The committee failed to hold the Adams administration accountable for missing protected bike and bus lane benchmarks. Advocates and council members voiced frustration at the lack of progress on urgent issues like traffic violence and the Streets Master Plan. The committee’s approach prioritized car-dependent communities and lagged behind previous leadership on safety reforms.
