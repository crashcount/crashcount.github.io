Primary sponsor Emily Gallagher leads a bloc of co-sponsors, including Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, and others.

The crash occurred in the dark, with no crosswalk or signal present at the location. The report states the driver was distracted, citing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor.

Change comes fast.</p><p class=mb3>On December 31, 2024, New York announced new transportation laws for 2025. Senator James Sanders sponsored a ban on car lease turn-in fees, stating, "The legislation prohibits charging a turn-in fee at the expiration of the term of a vehicle lease, the basis of which is solely for administrative, handling or clerical charges." Governor Kathy Hochul signed this and other safety bills into law. Charter bus passengers ages 8 to 16 must now wear seatbelts, a response to a fatal crash in Orange County. Sammy's Law, enacted in 2024, lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, and even 10 mph on redesigned streets. The Department of Transportation will target 250 locations, focusing on school zones. The MTA launches congestion pricing in Manhattan, with funds set for transit upgrades. Hochul said, "These enhancements to our roads and bridges will improve mobility for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists alike."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
