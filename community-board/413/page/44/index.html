In the last twelve months, 12 people died and 1,392 were injured in crashes across Queens CB13. Eight suffered serious injuries. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons. In the past year, four people over 75 died. One was only 18. The violence does not stop for age.</p><p>Just last week, July 5, a 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of a sedan on Cross Island Parkway. Two days earlier, a 39-year-old man was killed, ejected from his scooter on Nashville Boulevard. The week before, a 26-year-old man died behind the wheel on Hillside Avenue. The list does not end. It only grows.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The stories are sharp. A BMW vaults the divider on Belt Parkway. The car catches fire. Passengers are thrown onto the road. &ldquo;They went airborne and into the barrier,&rdquo; a survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>said</a>. &ldquo;Jewel was already dead when she flew out the car,&rdquo; the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>survivor added</a>.</p><p>A bus turns on Springfield Boulevard. A crane slams into its side. Windows shatter. Riders cry out. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us,&rdquo; a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>told reporters</a>. &ldquo;The bus driver didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong,&rdquo; the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>passenger said</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have passed bills. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She has called out the Department of Transportation: &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>Brooks-Powers said</a>.</p><p>But the streets are not safe. The city has not met its own promises. The bodies keep coming. Most deaths are caused by cars and trucks. The old, the young, the careful, the unlucky. All are at risk.</p><h3 id=act-nowdemand-action>Act Now—Demand Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city stop blaming the dead and start protecting the living. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Riders wait.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2022, Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) joined transit advocates at a rally demanding urgent improvements to New York City's bus system. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the Bus Turnaround coalition's renewed push for dedicated busways, more bus lanes, and increased funding. Restler said, 'We need a real busway on Jay Street,' citing rampant illegal driving and slow service. The rally criticized City Hall for ambitious targets but no concrete plans. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez promised 150 new miles of bus lanes, but advocates noted delays and lack of enforcement. The recommendations aim to speed up buses for vulnerable riders—working-class, immigrant, and communities of color—who rely on slow, unreliable service. The rally underscored the urgent need for action to protect and prioritize those most at risk on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On February 18, 2022, the Department of Transportation announced a delay in its plan to bolster protected bike lanes. The Adams administration had promised to harden 20 miles of bike lanes within its first 100 days. Now, DOT says the work will finish by the end of 2023. The first phase covers just 5.5 miles in Manhattan and Queens. DOT Commissioner Rodriguez said, “We have an actionable, concrete plan to protect cyclists and we are going to deliver on this work to keep our lanes clear.” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the upgrades, calling for safe biking citywide. Community Board 3’s Michelle Kuppersmith highlighted the need for political will. Still, the delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as the city also postponed pedestrian space on the Queensboro Bridge. The slow rollout means danger lingers for cyclists and walkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, not tied to a specific bill, reviewed automated enforcement and street design. It found speed cameras are evenly distributed and reduce crashes, but dangerous road design still puts lives at risk. Adams and other leaders called for more cameras and urgent street redesigns, echoing the article’s summary: 'Cameras have led to fewer crashes, injuries, and fatalities, but high numbers of tickets in some neighborhoods are attributed to unsafe road design, not camera placement.' Community voices stressed that automated enforcement helps, but cannot replace permanent fixes to deadly streets. The Department of Transportation’s lack of transparency on camera locations remains a concern.
