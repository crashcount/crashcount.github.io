Twenty-eight seriously hurt.</strong> Over 4,400 injured since 2022. Each number is a life cut short or broken.</p><p>Just days ago, a 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of a sedan on the Cross Island Parkway. She never made it home. On the Belt Parkway, a BMW went airborne. Two died. Others were thrown from the car, the road burning beneath them. “They went airborne and into the barrier,” a survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>said</a>. “Jewel was already dead when she flew out the car.”</p><p>A crane slammed into a city bus in Queens Village. Four hurt. “We didn’t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us,” a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>said</a>. The bus driver did nothing wrong. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The old, the young, the ones on foot. <strong>SUVs and cars did most of the killing.</strong> Trucks and buses followed. Bikes caused two minor injuries. No one died from a bike. The road is not equal. The strong crush the weak.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers has called for more transparency from DOT. “DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results,” she <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>said</a>. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, a step to stop blaming the dead for crossing the street. She co-sponsored bills for more daylight at corners and better data on e-bikes. But the pace is slow. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead. The road will not change itself. Only you can force their hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Wilfredo Florentino, Brooklyn Community Board 5, says, “Just placing cameras ain't gonna cut it.” The analysis shows that dangerous, wide arterials in communities of color drive up traffic violence.

The report, not tied to a specific bill, reviewed automated enforcement and street design. It found speed cameras are evenly distributed and reduce crashes, but dangerous road design still puts lives at risk. Adams and other leaders called for more cameras and urgent street redesigns, echoing the article’s summary: 'Cameras have led to fewer crashes, injuries, and fatalities, but high numbers of tickets in some neighborhoods are attributed to unsafe road design, not camera placement.' Community voices stressed that automated enforcement helps, but cannot replace permanent fixes to deadly streets. The Department of Transportation’s lack of transparency on camera locations remains a concern.

The Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, faces mounting pressure. The matter summary states: 'A final analysis of 2021 crash statistics revealed that it was the deadliest year in the eight-year history of New York City's Vision Zero initiative.' Transportation Alternatives demanded urgent action: reclaiming street space from cars, redesigning intersections, upgrading bike lanes, and more. Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez pledged intersection redesigns and stronger bike lanes, but no changes have rolled out. Brooks-Powers called every death 'an avoidable tragedy' and vowed to push for safer streets. The city stands at a crossroads.

The plan faces cost, freight, and construction hurdles. Public review comes next.</p><p class=mb3>On January 21, 2022, Gov. Hochul announced the Interborough Express (IBX) project, a new train line connecting Bay Ridge in Brooklyn to Jackson Heights in Queens. The project is in early stages, with environmental review and public input ahead. The MTA’s feasibility study considered light rail, commuter rail, and bus rapid transit, aiming for a 45-minute end-to-end trip. The matter summary states: 'New York City is getting a new train line, the Interborough Express (IBX), thanks to Gov. Hochul's support for passenger service on the rail right of way connecting Queens and Brooklyn.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso voiced support at the announcement. The project uses existing right-of-way, avoiding eminent domain, but faces challenges with freight integration, track upgrades, and uncertain costs. Modular station designs aim to keep expenses down. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users has been published.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New laws hit drivers who hide plates or fake exemptions. The MTA loses millions to evasion. Lawmakers debate fairness and credits. Enforcement sharpens. Revenue for transit hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Bill 42, part of Governor Hochul’s 2022 executive budget, aims to enforce congestion pricing by introducing new penalties for toll evasion. The proposal, discussed in the Senate on January 20, 2022, lets the DMV deny registration to vehicles with unpaid tolls and sets fines up to $5,000 for fraudulent exemption claims. The matter summary states: 'Governor Kathy Hochul's executive budget includes several changes to New York's congestion pricing program, which is expected to provide crucial revenue for transit upgrades.' Senator James Skoufis, mentioned in the hearing, pushed for credits for certain drivers. The bill is supported by MTA spokesperson Eugene Resnick and Governor Hochul’s office, who say it will ensure fairness. The MTA reports $4 million lost annually to toll evaders. The review board will finalize fee structures and exemptions.
