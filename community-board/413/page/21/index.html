In the last twelve months, 12 people died and 1,392 were injured in crashes across Queens CB13. Eight suffered serious injuries. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons. In the past year, four people over 75 died. One was only 18. The violence does not stop for age.</p><p>Just last week, July 5, a 76-year-old woman died in the back seat of a sedan on Cross Island Parkway. Two days earlier, a 39-year-old man was killed, ejected from his scooter on Nashville Boulevard. The week before, a 26-year-old man died behind the wheel on Hillside Avenue. The list does not end. It only grows.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The stories are sharp. A BMW vaults the divider on Belt Parkway. The car catches fire. Passengers are thrown onto the road. &ldquo;They went airborne and into the barrier,&rdquo; a survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>said</a>. &ldquo;Jewel was already dead when she flew out the car,&rdquo; the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>survivor added</a>.</p><p>A bus turns on Springfield Boulevard. A crane slams into its side. Windows shatter. Riders cry out. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us,&rdquo; a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>told reporters</a>. &ldquo;The bus driver didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong,&rdquo; the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>passenger said</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have passed bills. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She has called out the Department of Transportation: &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>Brooks-Powers said</a>.</p><p>But the streets are not safe. The city has not met its own promises. The bodies keep coming. Most deaths are caused by cars and trucks. The old, the young, the careful, the unlucky. All are at risk.</p><h3 id=act-nowdemand-action>Act Now—Demand Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city stop blaming the dead and start protecting the living. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure, previously stripped down in committee, now returns to its original form. The matter title: 'Prophet Motive: Restler Bill Would Restore 25% Bounty for Blocked Bike and Bus Lane Tickets.' Restler vows to push hard for passage, saying, 'This bill would make a tremendous difference in making our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.' The bill’s fate is uncertain after Restler’s removal from the Transportation Committee, but the intent is clear: shift enforcement from NYPD to the people, and clear the way for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would repeal and replace Section 19-189 of the city code, requiring the Department of Transportation to report crash data and feasibility findings to the Mayor and Council Speaker. After the study, the Commissioner may install traffic-calming measures where possible. The bill remains 'Laid Over in Committee' as of June 25, 2024. No safety analyst note is available, but the bill targets systemic risk where children walk and drivers speed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers (District 31), chair of the Transportation Committee, criticized Vision Zero’s uneven impact. The report, titled "NYC streets have gotten safer under Vision Zero – especially if you live in a white neighborhood," found that while traffic fatalities dropped citywide, majority-Black communities saw a 13% increase and Latino areas a 30% rise. Brooks-Powers said, "It is deeply concerning that communities of color are experiencing fatalities at higher rates." The report states, "It's clear the program has not been fully or effectively implemented in neighborhoods of color and with lower incomes." DOT spokesperson Anna Correa responded that recent plans focus more resources on high-poverty, non-white neighborhoods, but the safety gap persists. The data shows Vision Zero’s benefits depend on where you live—and who the city prioritizes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Drivers ignored them. Cars block both ends. Cyclists forced into traffic. Police rarely ticket. Council stalls on citizen reporting. The city’s fix failed. Cyclists pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On January 12, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported on the failure of new concrete barriers meant to protect bike lanes on Park Avenue in the Bronx. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
