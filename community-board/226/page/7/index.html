The Department of Transportation installed safety measures north of Van Cortlandt Park, but not at the site of Rivera’s death. In 2022, Dinowitz’s district saw 1,659 reported crashes, injuring 135 pedestrians and 27 cyclists. The city’s inaction left a deadly gap.

The move answers NJ’s threat to block data sharing. Without cooperation, speeders dodge camera tickets. Streets stay dangerous. Lawmakers trade barbs. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. On September 28, 2022, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz introduced a proposal in the New York State Legislature. The bill, now in committee, would impose a $50 fee on vehicles registered in states—like New Jersey—that refuse to share driver data for traffic enforcement. The measure responds to a New Jersey Senate bill blocking DMV data sharing, which could undermine New York City’s automated speed camera program. Dinowitz said, 'There's going to have to be a price to pay if my bill passes.' Safe streets advocates and NYC DOT warn that blocking data sharing lets speeders escape penalties, fueling traffic violence. The bill’s text states it 'authorizes the imposition of a $50 fee on vehicles entering NYC which are registered in states which do not cooperate with New York in the enforcement of traffic infractions through the use of photo-monitoring devices or signal monitoring systems.' The fight leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as enforcement gaps let reckless drivers go unpunished.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
