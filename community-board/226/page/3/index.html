The rider, a 33-year-old man, was ejected from his motorcycle and suffered severe lacerations across his entire body. The report describes the rider as conscious but bleeding and torn after being thrown onto the roadway. The primary contributing factor cited in the police report is 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The motorcycle's center front end struck the SUV's center back end, underscoring the violence of the impact. No victim behavior is listed as a contributing factor in the report.

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers. Streets belong to people again.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now Local Law 98 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 26, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assemblymember Jeffrey Dinowitz said, 'People shouldn’t run red lights... when they do that they endanger other people’s lives, and people have died.' Heastie controlled the vote. A separate bill to ticket cars blocking street sweepers failed to reach the floor. Advocates pushed for both measures, but only the camera expansion passed.

Current caps let companies treat tickets as business costs. Streets fill with trucks. Residents lose space. The city wants power to set real deterrents. Albany holds the key.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0449-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced June 6, 2024, it urges the State Legislature to let cities raise the cap on commercial overnight parking fines. The matter title reads: "Resolution calling on the State legislature to increase the cap on commercial overnight fines for cities." Council Members Eric Dinowitz (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, and Robert F. Holden back the measure. They argue that capped fines are too low—companies absorb them, streets clog with trucks, and residents pay the price. The Council wants authority to set fines that actually deter illegal parking. The resolution points to nearly 27,000 complaints in 2021 and notes that current enforcement tools are weak. The bill is still in committee, awaiting further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
