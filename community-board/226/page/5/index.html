Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous.

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. On September 28, 2022, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz introduced a proposal in the New York State Legislature. The bill, now in committee, would impose a $50 fee on vehicles registered in states—like New Jersey—that refuse to share driver data for traffic enforcement. The measure responds to a New Jersey Senate bill blocking DMV data sharing, which could undermine New York City’s automated speed camera program. Dinowitz said, 'There's going to have to be a price to pay if my bill passes.' Safe streets advocates and NYC DOT warn that blocking data sharing lets speeders escape penalties, fueling traffic violence. The bill’s text states it 'authorizes the imposition of a $50 fee on vehicles entering NYC which are registered in states which do not cooperate with New York in the enforcement of traffic infractions through the use of photo-monitoring devices or signal monitoring systems.' The fight leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as enforcement gaps let reckless drivers go unpunished.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal would charge drivers up to $23 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. Dinowitz opposed credits for New Jersey drivers, calling them unfair. The debate, covered by gothamist.com, highlighted concerns from truckers, ride-share drivers, and advocates. The matter summary reads: 'Debate over NYC congestion pricing picks up as more effects of the plan emerge.' Critics, including Rep. Ritchie Torres, warned the plan could push more diesel trucks onto the Cross Bronx Expressway, raising public health and equity concerns.

The matter, presented to Bronx Community Board 8’s Transportation Committee, was rejected in a close vote. Council Member Eric Dinowitz voiced strong opposition to the DOT’s process, calling it 'undemocratic' and criticizing the lack of community input, though he did not oppose the road diet itself. The DOT justified the changes by citing significant crash and injury data, and pointed to successful safety improvements from similar projects elsewhere in the Bronx. Dinowitz stated, 'I have been deeply troubled throughout this process due to the constant misrepresentation of facts and the lack of responsiveness to the community.' Despite local resistance, the DOT moves forward, prioritizing safety on a corridor marked by multiple fatalities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger stalks city streets, especially near schools.</p><p class=mb3>On May 26, 2022, the New York City Council voted 43-7 to approve Albany’s extension and expansion of the city’s speed camera program. The measure, handled by the Transportation Committee, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7. The matter summary: 'The City Council approved Albany's extension and expansion of New York's speed camera program, allowing cameras to operate 24/7, but not before several council members voiced opposition.' Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers urged action, saying, 'We must use all the tools at our disposal.' Council Members Joan Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and David Carr opposed, calling cameras a financial burden. Eric Dinowitz defended the program: 'If you don't want a speeding ticket, don't speed.' The vote came after a year of high road deaths, with special risk near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
