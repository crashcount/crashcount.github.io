Twenty-nine dead last year. Highest ever. Reckless drivers surge post-pandemic. City report demands more cameras—jump from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Officials back the bill. Victims’ families demand action. Cameras cut crashes. But the most dangerous drivers remain loose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2024, the Department of Transportation released a report urging passage of a bill to expand New York City’s red-light camera program. The bill, supported by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and sponsored by State Senator Andrew Goundardes, would boost camera coverage from 150 to 1,325 intersections—about 10% of the city’s 13,700 signals. The report states: “Expanding the number of intersections with red light cameras... could substantially enhance the deterrent effect of the program and return New York City to the consistently downward trend of red light-running behavior we had seen prior to the pandemic.” Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz also supports expansion, calling for cameras at every intersection. The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains. Relatives of crash victims joined the call, demanding the city confront driver negligence and protect the community.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Eric Dinowitz, is under committee review. The legislation states, 'the city would have to install between one and five weather-proof enclosures with six to eight spaces apiece, depending on the size of the park.' Parks over 2.5 acres must have at least one shelter; parks over 250 acres need five. City buildings over 10,000 square feet, including public schools, must provide bike storage for workers and visitors. Marte said, 'If we want to get off the reliance of people commuting by car, we have to offer them alternative ways to get there.' The Parks Department and city agencies must report on implementation or explain impracticality. This bill targets safer, more accessible bike infrastructure for New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
