They say every life matters. They point to new speed limits and more cameras. But in Bronx CB26, the numbers do not move fast enough. One death. Dozens of broken bodies. The council and the mayor have the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph.

DOT denied their request, citing low crash data.</p><p class=mb3>On March 10, 2025, Council Member Eric Dinowitz and Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz pressed the city for speed humps and four-way stop signs in Riverdale, following a hit-and-run that injured a 9-year-old girl. Their request, sent to the Department of Transportation before the crash, was denied due to low car volumes and insufficient crash history. The lawmakers, at a press conference, supported speed humps and stop signs but opposed road diets and universal daylighting. Eric Dinowitz argued, 'If you walked down any of these streets, they are far too narrow to narrow any more.' He also rejected citywide daylighting, insisting, 'Daylighting has to be done corner by corner.' The council member has criticized DOT’s safety efforts before, framing the agency as unresponsive.

Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz stated, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz highlighted the broader issue: "We’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced."

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
