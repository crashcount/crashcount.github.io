Focus enforcement and calming during evening peaks, when deaths cluster between 6 PM and 9 PM (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>The Next Move</p><p>Citywide tools exist. Lower speeds save people, and state lawmakers have a bill on the table for repeat speeders. Our district’s senator has voted it forward; the Assembly can push it too. The Council and DOT can clear sightlines at corners. The levers are there. Use them. Then go one step further.</p><p>One call can help move a law, a signal, a bolt in the asphalt.
