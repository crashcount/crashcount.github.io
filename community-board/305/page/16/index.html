In January, an SUV turning left at Blake hit a 57‑year‑old woman in the crosswalk. She had the signal. She died at the scene, the record says. The driver failed to yield and was distracted, according to the crash report [NYC Open Data].</p><p>A few blocks south at Seaview, a Porsche SUV slammed into a pickup this spring. The 28‑year‑old driver died there too. The file lists speed and distraction [NYC Open Data].</p><p>On Gateway Drive after midnight in July, a 21‑year‑old on foot was struck and killed. The report cites driver distraction and unsafe speed [NYC Open Data].</p><p>These are not outliers. Since 2022 in Brooklyn CB5, seven people have been killed, including <strong>seven pedestrians and one cyclist across the broader tally</strong>; thousands more were hurt. SUVs and sedans do most of the damage to people on foot here [PeriodStats].</p><h3 id=where-the-street-bleeds>Where the street bleeds</h3><p>The worst names repeat. <strong>Pennsylvania Avenue</strong> shows two deaths and hundreds injured. <strong>Linden Boulevard</strong> stacks nearly three hundred injuries. These corridors are long, wide, and fast. They don’t forgive [small_geo_analysis].</p><p>The hours tell on us. Injuries spike in the late day and into night. From 4 p.m. through 11 p.m., the toll rises, peaking around the <strong>evening hours when multiple deaths occur</strong> [small_geo_analysis].</p><p>The causes on paper are plain: failure to yield, unsafe speed, and distraction. Failure to yield killed at Blake. Speed and distraction killed at Seaview and Gateway. The dataset’s top category is a catch‑all “other,” but the named factors keep repeating in the blood [small_geo_analysis].</p><h3 id=what-police-and-press-say-when-someone-dies>What police and press say when someone dies</h3><p>“A driver struck and killed a 47‑year‑old pedestrian … then left the scene,” police said of a nearby Bushwick case at Broadway and Suydam. Detectives said the victim was dragged more than 50 feet. Police said they were still seeking the driver [NY Daily News; Gothamist].</p><p>“EMS pronounced the victim dead at the scene,” an FDNY spokesman said after a man fell onto the Sutter Ave L tracks in East New York. Police said no criminality was suspected [NY Daily News].</p><h3 id=the-bodies-behind-the-numbers>The bodies behind the numbers</h3><p>A number is a person who didn’t come home. The 57‑year‑old had the walk signal on Pennsylvania and Blake. The 21‑year‑old was out after midnight by Gateway. The 28‑year‑old hit speed and metal at Seaview. Files don’t hold last words. They log impact points and bumper damage [NYC Open Data].</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-that-kill>Fix the corners that kill</h3><p>Start where the harm is worst: Pennsylvania Avenue and Linden Boulevard. Cut turning speeds and sightlines at crosswalks. Use daylighting and hardened turns so drivers can’t sweep through people in the walk. Put leading pedestrian intervals at signals. Protect crossings where people are getting hit at night. Target <strong>failure‑to‑yield and speeding</strong> with focused enforcement at evening peaks the data flags [small_geo_analysis].</p><h3 id=stop-the-speeders-who-dont-stop>Stop the speeders who don’t stop</h3><p>Albany moved a tool. The Senate advanced the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong>; Sen. Roxanne Persaud voted yes in committee. The bill would require repeat speeders to install speed limiters. It targets the small group that does outsized harm [Open States].</p><p>City Hall has another lever. Sammy’s Law gives NYC power to lower speed limits. The city can drop residential speeds to 20 mph. It hasn’t done it yet. We need slower default speeds where people live and walk [Take Action page].</p><p>Lower the speeds. Rein in the repeat offenders. Start with Pennsylvania Avenue. Don’t wait for the next line in a spreadsheet.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall to act: <strong><a href=/take_action/>ask the city to lower speeds and curb repeat speeders</a></strong>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill states: “prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.” Council Member Erik D. Bottcher leads, joined by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and over two dozen co-sponsors. The law orders the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections each year, up from 100. The city must also run outreach and education. The bill aims to keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike. No more hiding behind parked cars.
