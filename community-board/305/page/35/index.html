A burgundy Ford Explorer comes fast. The man does not make it across. The driver does not stop. The man dies at the hospital. The street is quiet again, but the loss stays. Police are still looking for the driver. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyn-hit-and-run-driver-wanted-after-striking-man-in-street/>The man was crossing the street in Cypress Hills when he was hit by a burgundy Ford Explorer.</a></p><p>He is not alone. In the last twelve months, <strong>2 people have died and 17 have been seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>Over 1,350 have been hurt.</strong> The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.

Two people over 55 are dead.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call your council member.
