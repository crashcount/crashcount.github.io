Forty-eight more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, there have been over 8,000 crashes. Each number is a life changed or ended. Each crash leaves a mark on the street and on the families left behind.</p><p>Just this spring, a 28-year-old man died on Seaview Avenue. The cause: <strong>driver inattention and unsafe speed</strong>. He bled out in the street, another body for the tally. In January, a 57-year-old woman was killed crossing Pennsylvania Avenue. She had the signal. The driver, in an SUV, did not yield. She died at the intersection, her right of way ignored. The city records the cause as <strong>failure to yield and distraction</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Of the dead, most were on foot. SUVs and sedans are the main weapons. In the last twelve months, injuries have jumped. Deaths have tripled compared to last year. Children, the elderly, the ones who walk because they must—these are the faces behind the numbers.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Members <a href=/council-district/42/>Chris Banks</a> and <a href=/council-district/37/>Sandy Nurse</a> co-sponsored bills for discounted bike share for seniors and students. They voted to remove abandoned vehicles. But the core crisis remains: <strong>speed and reckless driving</strong>. State Senator <a href=/senate-district/19/>Roxanne Persaud</a> voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. But the streets are still deadly.</p><p>A mother lost her only daughter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>. The pain does not fade. The tire marks stay in the lot for days. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them: <strong>lower the speed limit, redesign the streets, stop repeat offenders.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Epps, unlicensed, "blew a stop sign" and struck a school bus, killing his passenger, Imani Vance, and injuring the bus driver. The article quotes Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez: "The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant's reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds." Epps left the scene, tried to escape in an Uber, and was arrested after fleeing on foot. The crash was one of three fatal Brooklyn incidents that weekend. City data cited in the article shows ongoing danger: at least 15 killed in Kings County so far this year, with thousands injured, often due to driver inattention and failure to yield.

No students were on the bus at the time. The victims were hospitalized with serious injuries. Witnesses described the bus waiting for a pedestrian before suddenly jumping the curb and smashing through the fence.

Their son remains hospitalized. The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 21 speeding tickets—15 in school zones—over two years. Lawmakers and advocates called for legislation requiring speed limiter devices on cars of drivers with more than six camera violations. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said the driver 'clearly would've met the threshold.' NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the crash 'a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.' The bill aims to prevent repeat offenders from exceeding speed limits.

Police say Yarimi sped through a red light at Ocean Parkway and Quinten Rd., striking Natasha Saada and her three young children as they crossed with the signal. The mother and two daughters died; her son remains hospitalized. Yarimi faces charges including manslaughter, reckless driving, and aggravated unlicensed operation. The article quotes a relative: 'It's a very sensitive time for us, for our community and for our family.' The crash highlights persistent dangers from unlicensed, repeat-offender drivers and the systemic failures that let them remain on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, "Yarimi reportedly has a history of reckless driving, with 15 school zone speeding and red-light tickets in the last 12 months, and over $10,000 in fines." NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called it "a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road." The crash left nine injured, including the family's 4-year-old son in critical condition. Both drivers were expected to be tested for drunken driving. Yarimi had not been charged at the time of reporting.
