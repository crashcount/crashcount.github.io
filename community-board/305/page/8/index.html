Councilmember Sandy Nurse, representing District 37, is involved, supporting more open space but warning, 'there's a long list of outstanding needs that the city has not prioritized.' The Economic Development Corporation opened bidding for the plaza, but demolition of the NYPD precinct will not start until 2028, with plaza completion after 2030. Residents like Benicia De La Cruz welcome accessibility but demand safer links to the LIRR. Boris Santos of the East New York Community Land Trust calls for long-term affordability. The project promises green space and transit improvements but leaves vulnerable road users exposed: safer street connections and real affordability protections are not guaranteed.
