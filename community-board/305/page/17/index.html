Demand fixes at Blake and Pennsylvania before another body.</p><h3 id=just-weeks-ago>Just Weeks Ago</h3><p>A woman crossed with the signal at Pennsylvania and Blake. A left-turning SUV hit her. She died. The record <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>says</a> failure to yield and distraction. It happened January 24. The city moved on. The street did not.</p><p>Early July, near Gateway Drive, a 21-year-old pedestrian was struck and killed. Unsafe speed. Driver inattention. Two lines in a log. A family undone.</p><p>Late July, at Jamaica and Richmond, a moped met a turning sedan. One rider never got up.</p><p>On the subway, the toll continued. Just last Sunday at Sutter Ave in East New York, “Around 6 p.m., a man fell onto the southbound tracks … and was struck by a train,” police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>said</a>. “EMS pronounced the victim dead at the scene,” an FDNY spokesman <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>said</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern>The Pattern</h3><p>This year in CB5: 1,602 crashes, 1,062 injuries, 12 serious injuries, 5 deaths — all up from last year to date. Crashes rose 14%, injuries 29%, deaths 400%. These are people. They are also proof; city data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>show</a>.</p><p>Cars and trucks do most of the harm to people on foot. Since 2022, they <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>account</a> for 759 pedestrian impacts, including 7 deaths. Motorcycles and mopeds: 18. Bikes: 10.</p><p>Gothamist <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>reported</a> another local crash: “Police said both vehicles were heading westbound on Pitkin Avenue” when a driver hit and killed a moped rider; charges were pending.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-did--and-didnt>What Leaders Did — And Didn’t</h3><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>a bill</a> to daylight 1,000 intersections a year — ban parking near crosswalks so people can see and be seen. It was laid over in committee.</p><p>On zoning and parking mandates, her office <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/26/city-of-yes-housing-parking-outer-transit-zone>said</a> the compromise “wasn’t something that was pushed for specifically by Council Member Nurse.”</p><p>State Sen. Roxanne Persaud voted yes in committee to require speed-limiters for repeat speeders on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. That targets the worst drivers. It does not fix the street at Blake and Penn.</p><h3 id=do-something-now>Do Something Now</h3><p>Call your council members. Tell them to pass daylighting. Call your state reps. Tell them to pass S 4045. Demand redesigns where people keep dying. Do not wait for the next body to make the case.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill states: “prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.” Council Member Erik D. Bottcher leads, joined by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and over two dozen co-sponsors. The law orders the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections each year, up from 100. The city must also run outreach and education. The bill aims to keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike. No more hiding behind parked cars.

A 2023 Nissan SUV, traveling north, was making a right turn when it struck a westbound bicyclist going straight ahead. The report cites the driver’s errors as "Traffic Control Disregarded" and "Turning Improperly." The bicyclist, a 39-year-old male, sustained abrasions to his knee, lower leg, and foot but was not ejected and remained conscious. The SUV showed no damage, and the cyclist’s safety equipment status is unknown. The collision’s point of impact was the SUV’s right rear quarter panel and the bike’s center front end. The report highlights driver failure to obey traffic signals and improper turning as the primary causes, with no contributing factors attributed to the bicyclist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
