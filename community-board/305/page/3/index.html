A burgundy Ford Explorer comes fast. The man does not make it across. The driver does not stop. The man dies at the hospital. The street is quiet again, but the loss stays. Police are still looking for the driver. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyn-hit-and-run-driver-wanted-after-striking-man-in-street/>The man was crossing the street in Cypress Hills when he was hit by a burgundy Ford Explorer.</a></p><p>He is not alone. In the last twelve months, <strong>2 people have died and 17 have been seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>Over 1,350 have been hurt.</strong> The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.

Two people over 55 are dead.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call your council member.

The bill requires drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red-light camera tickets in twelve months, to install intelligent speed assistance devices. Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes led the push, joined by co-sponsors Samra Brouk, Cordell Cleare, and others. The vote passed with support from senators including Jeremy Cooney, Pete Harckham, and Jessica Ramos. The measure aims to rein in repeat offenders and reduce deadly speeding. The bill’s language is blunt: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.'
