The article states, "The suspect was somehow able to drive off the lot with the operator on board, making it down the block to 25th and Cropsey avenues, where he crashed into a parked car." No injuries were reported. Police took the man into custody at the scene. The incident highlights a lapse in depot security, as the intruder was known to frequent the area and accessed the bus before the route began.

Grief and anger fill Brooklyn.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (May 2, 2025) reports on the fatal crash that killed a mother and two children on Ocean Parkway. The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving. The article highlights the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill, which would require speed limiter devices for drivers with six or more camera violations in a year. Amber Adler, a local advocate, calls Ocean Parkway a 'safety menace' and urges passage of the bill. The crash exposes gaps in enforcement and policy, leaving repeat offenders unchecked and vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
