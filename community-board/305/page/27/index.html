The force of the crash left the man conscious but badly hurt. The scene was chaos—metal, glass, and blood on the street.

Major advocacy groups—StreetsPAC, Open Plans, and Transportation Alternatives—oppose the measure, warning it would 'sabotage mode shift while targeting nonwhite delivery workers' and 'create additional hurdles for low-income New Yorkers.' The bill does not address illegal mopeds, lacks funding, and omits enforcement details. DOT is reviewing the proposal.
