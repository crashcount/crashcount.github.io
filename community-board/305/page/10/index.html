A burgundy Ford Explorer comes fast. The man does not make it across. The driver does not stop. The man dies at the hospital. The street is quiet again, but the loss stays. Police are still looking for the driver. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyn-hit-and-run-driver-wanted-after-striking-man-in-street/>The man was crossing the street in Cypress Hills when he was hit by a burgundy Ford Explorer.</a></p><p>He is not alone. In the last twelve months, <strong>2 people have died and 17 have been seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>Over 1,350 have been hurt.</strong> The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.

Two people over 55 are dead.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call your council member.

The bill, introduced January 8, 2025, in the New York State Assembly, is titled: "Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles." Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage. Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes. The measure signals strong legislative support for systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike. The bill has not yet received a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
