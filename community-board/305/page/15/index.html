Demand fixes at Blake and Pennsylvania before another body.</p><h3 id=just-weeks-ago>Just Weeks Ago</h3><p>A woman crossed with the signal at Pennsylvania and Blake. A left-turning SUV hit her. She died. The record <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>says</a> failure to yield and distraction. It happened January 24. The city moved on. The street did not.</p><p>Early July, near Gateway Drive, a 21-year-old pedestrian was struck and killed. Unsafe speed. Driver inattention. Two lines in a log. A family undone.</p><p>Late July, at Jamaica and Richmond, a moped met a turning sedan. One rider never got up.</p><p>On the subway, the toll continued. Just last Sunday at Sutter Ave in East New York, “Around 6 p.m., a man fell onto the southbound tracks … and was struck by a train,” police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>said</a>. “EMS pronounced the victim dead at the scene,” an FDNY spokesman <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>said</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern>The Pattern</h3><p>This year in CB5: 1,602 crashes, 1,062 injuries, 12 serious injuries, 5 deaths — all up from last year to date. Crashes rose 14%, injuries 29%, deaths 400%. These are people. They are also proof; city data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>show</a>.</p><p>Cars and trucks do most of the harm to people on foot. Since 2022, they <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>account</a> for 759 pedestrian impacts, including 7 deaths. Motorcycles and mopeds: 18. Bikes: 10.</p><p>Gothamist <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>reported</a> another local crash: “Police said both vehicles were heading westbound on Pitkin Avenue” when a driver hit and killed a moped rider; charges were pending.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-did--and-didnt>What Leaders Did — And Didn’t</h3><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>a bill</a> to daylight 1,000 intersections a year — ban parking near crosswalks so people can see and be seen. It was laid over in committee.</p><p>On zoning and parking mandates, her office <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/26/city-of-yes-housing-parking-outer-transit-zone>said</a> the compromise “wasn’t something that was pushed for specifically by Council Member Nurse.”</p><p>State Sen. Roxanne Persaud voted yes in committee to require speed-limiters for repeat speeders on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. That targets the worst drivers. It does not fix the street at Blake and Penn.</p><h3 id=do-something-now>Do Something Now</h3><p>Call your council members. Tell them to pass daylighting. Call your state reps. Tell them to pass S 4045. Demand redesigns where people keep dying. Do not wait for the next body to make the case.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
