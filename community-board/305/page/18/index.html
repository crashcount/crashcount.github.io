Fifty more are left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 8,500 crashes since 2022. The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just this July, a 21-year-old woman was killed by a sedan on Gateway Drive. The driver was distracted. She was not in the road. She died anyway. The crash report lists the cause: <strong>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo; and &ldquo;Unsafe Speed&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>In January, a 57-year-old woman was crossing Pennsylvania Avenue with the signal. An SUV turned left. She never made it to the other side. The driver failed to yield. She died at the intersection (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>The streets do not forgive.</strong></p><h3 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Since 2022, they have taken seven lives and left hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are in the mix, but the big machines do the most damage.</p><p>The pattern is clear. The pain is not spread evenly. The young, the old, the ones on foot—they pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. <strong>State Senator Roxanne Persaud <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to extend school speed zones and to curb repeat speeders</a></strong>. Assembly Member Nikki Lucas did the same. Council Member Chris Banks <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills for safer bike share and removing abandoned vehicles</a>.</p><p>But the carnage continues. <strong>&ldquo;We wait until someone dies.

The bill reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to install e-bicycle battery stations.' Council Members Carlina Rivera (primary sponsor), Sandy Nurse, and Shahana K. Hanif back the measure. It mandates DOT to install at least 35 e-bike battery stations each year for five years, with at least 25% curbside for secure parking. DOT must report on station rollout and post locations online. The bill aims to reshape curb space and infrastructure for e-bike riders, but offers no direct safety analysis for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
