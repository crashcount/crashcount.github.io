A burgundy Ford Explorer comes fast. The man does not make it across. The driver does not stop. The man dies at the hospital. The street is quiet again, but the loss stays. Police are still looking for the driver. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyn-hit-and-run-driver-wanted-after-striking-man-in-street/>The man was crossing the street in Cypress Hills when he was hit by a burgundy Ford Explorer.</a></p><p>He is not alone. In the last twelve months, <strong>2 people have died and 17 have been seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>Over 1,350 have been hurt.</strong> The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.

Two people over 55 are dead.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call your council member.

The bill aimed to amend city law to require the Department of Transportation to finish all street resurfacing work within two weeks. If more time was needed, the department would have to notify the community, stating the reason and new timeline. The matter summary reads: 'ensure that all work associated with the resurfacing of any street is finalized within 2 weeks from the start of work.' Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by thirty other members. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst reviewed the impact, but torn-up streets are a known threat to pedestrians and cyclists. The bill is dead.
