A burgundy Ford Explorer comes fast. The man does not make it across. The driver does not stop. The man dies at the hospital. The street is quiet again, but the loss stays. Police are still looking for the driver. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyn-hit-and-run-driver-wanted-after-striking-man-in-street/>The man was crossing the street in Cypress Hills when he was hit by a burgundy Ford Explorer.</a></p><p>He is not alone. In the last twelve months, <strong>2 people have died and 17 have been seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>Over 1,350 have been hurt.</strong> The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.

Two people over 55 are dead.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call your council member.

The bill required the Department of Transportation to post details of all traffic control device and speed reducer requests on a public website. The matter summary reads: 'The required website would include, but need not be limited to, the following information: case number, general topic, issue, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial of traffic control device, and if approved, the timeline for completion.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by 21 co-sponsors including Williams, Hanif, and Yeger. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided, but the measure aimed to end secrecy around life-saving street changes. Public access to this data could expose delays and denials that keep streets deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the NYPD and Department of Transportation to publish detailed data on electric bicycle and scooter use, including crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The official summary read: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to reporting data about electric bicycles and electric scooters.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Marjorie Velázquez, Sandy Nurse, Kevin C. Riley, and Gale A. Brewer backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. If passed, it would have forced the city to break out crash data by vehicle type, borough, and precinct—shining a light on the toll for riders and pedestrians.
