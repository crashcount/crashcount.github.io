Forty-eight more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, there have been over 8,000 crashes. Each number is a life changed or ended. Each crash leaves a mark on the street and on the families left behind.</p><p>Just this spring, a 28-year-old man died on Seaview Avenue. The cause: <strong>driver inattention and unsafe speed</strong>. He bled out in the street, another body for the tally. In January, a 57-year-old woman was killed crossing Pennsylvania Avenue. She had the signal. The driver, in an SUV, did not yield. She died at the intersection, her right of way ignored. The city records the cause as <strong>failure to yield and distraction</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Of the dead, most were on foot. SUVs and sedans are the main weapons. In the last twelve months, injuries have jumped. Deaths have tripled compared to last year. Children, the elderly, the ones who walk because they must—these are the faces behind the numbers.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Members <a href=/council-district/42/>Chris Banks</a> and <a href=/council-district/37/>Sandy Nurse</a> co-sponsored bills for discounted bike share for seniors and students. They voted to remove abandoned vehicles. But the core crisis remains: <strong>speed and reckless driving</strong>. State Senator <a href=/senate-district/19/>Roxanne Persaud</a> voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. But the streets are still deadly.</p><p>A mother lost her only daughter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>. The pain does not fade. The tire marks stay in the lot for days. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call your senator. Tell them: <strong>lower the speed limit, redesign the streets, stop repeat offenders.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
