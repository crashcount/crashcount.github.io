Since 2022, ten people have died on these streets. Forty-eight have been left with serious injuries. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><p>Just last month, a child lost a leg in a crash. In January, a woman crossing Pennsylvania Avenue was killed by an SUV. In April, a man died at the wheel, his body broken by speed and distraction. The dead do not speak, but the numbers keep rising. More than 8,000 crashes. Nearly 5,000 injured.</p><h2 id=the-shape-of-the-danger>The Shape of the Danger</h2><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing: six deaths, 510 minor injuries, 131 moderate, nine serious. Trucks and buses add four serious injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they hurt, but they do not kill like the cars do. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone in between.</p><p>A neighbor said it plain after a recent hit-and-run: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>“Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.”</a> The city knows this. The state knows this. Still, the blood pools on the asphalt.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-and-silences>Leadership: Steps and Silences</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Members <a href=/council-district/42/>Chris Banks</a> and <a href=/council-district/37/>Sandy Nurse</a> voted to remove abandoned vehicles and co-sponsored bills for safer bike share and daylighting crosswalks. State Senator <a href=/senate-district/19/>Roxanne Persaud</a> voted yes to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/60/>Nikki Lucas</a> backed school speed zones too.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every day without a citywide 20 mph limit, another life is at risk.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement that targets the real danger—speed, not the people on foot or bike. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
