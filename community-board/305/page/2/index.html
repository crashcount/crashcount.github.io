When an officer stops an unlicensed van, they must review the list and issue the maximum penalty for each violation. Primary sponsor Nantasha M. Williams is joined by Selvena N.

The Council passed the bill with a veto-proof majority. Council Member Sandy Nurse, the sponsor, called out Adams for breaking his 2022 promise to raise pay standards. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection backed the bill, saying it would close gaps in pay protections. According to safety analysts, this event concerns labor protections and does not directly affect street safety or infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lane, once shielded from traffic, will be replaced with an unprotected version. NY1 notes, 'The lane is being shifted from its current position next to the sidewalk to the other side of parked cars.' This change eliminates the physical barrier that separated cyclists from moving vehicles. The move raises questions about city policy and the safety of vulnerable road users on this busy Brooklyn stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure sits with the Transportation Committee. Council Member Julie Won introduced it after deadly crashes in her district. Eighteen caucus members back the bill, aiming to force a vote this year. The matter: 'eliminate parking within 20 feet of an intersection.' Council Member Sandy Nurse called daylighting 'a proven, effective way to make our streets safer.' DOT raised doubts about non-hardened daylighting, but safety analysts say restricting parking near intersections improves visibility, reduces collisions, and protects people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists struck crossing Marine Parkway Bridge. Injuries mount. No answers. Danger lingers. System fails to clear the path.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-07-25) reports multiple cyclists injured by string stretched across the Marine Parkway Bridge walkway. Victims described sudden pain and red marks. One cyclist landed in intensive care in June. The NYPD said no criminality was suspected and has not identified the source. The MTA forbids cycling on the path, but most riders do not dismount due to the narrow walkway. The article quotes Angel Montalvo: "I felt pain, but I didn't know what it was." The recurring hazard exposes gaps in bridge safety and enforcement, leaving vulnerable users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
