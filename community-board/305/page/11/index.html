The article reports, "Yarimi, 35, was driving nearly double the speed limit when her Audi allegedly struck an Uber, flipped and mowed down the family." Police say Miriam Yarimi drove with a suspended license, no insurance, and expired registration, and ran a red light. She faces multiple charges, including manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The crash also injured an Uber driver and passengers.

The driver, with a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' struck the family as they crossed the street. The bill would require speed-limiting technology for drivers with repeated offenses—those with 11 or more points in 24 months, or six camera tickets in a year. Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, citing the crash, demand action: 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair... it’s time for us to act.'

Yarimi's car had over 93 violations, including 20 speeding tickets and five red-light violations since August 2023. Police said the car 'smashed into an Uber and went careening onto the sidewalk, striking victims.' Yarimi refused to speak to police, asking only for a lawyer.
