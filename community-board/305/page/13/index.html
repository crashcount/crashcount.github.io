She died there. The police listed failure to yield and distraction. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> records it as CrashID 4788343.</p><p>They were one of 13 people killed on the streets of Brooklyn CB5 since Jan 1, 2022, with 5,188 injured. Pedestrians account for 7 of those deaths; cyclists for 1. The city’s dataset shows 62 serious injuries across modes here in that period, with 8 serious cases clustered at 1000 Sutter Avenue. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Pennsylvania Avenue and Linden Boulevard carry the hurt: 419 injuries combined, and four deaths tied to Pennsylvania alone in the rollup of locations. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=where-the-danger-rises-each-day>Where the danger rises each day</h3><p>Harm peaks late day. Injuries stack up from 2 PM through 8 PM, with another spike at 9 PM and into the night. Deaths crest around the commute hours, including five at 4–6 PM and 8–10 PM in this data window. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Failure to yield shows up in the records. So does aggressive driving. Unsafe speed appears too. These are named factors in the CB5 rollup. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=streets-and-bodies>Streets and bodies</h3><p>On July 13, 2025, about 12:30 AM near 395 Gateway Drive, a 21‑year‑old pedestrian died. The driver was recorded for distraction and unsafe speed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On July 3, 2025, just before 10 PM at Broadway and East New York Avenue, a 36‑year‑old pedestrian was killed at the intersection. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Apr 29, 2025, around 8 PM at Pennsylvania and Seaview, a 28‑year‑old driver was killed in a crash involving a pickup and an SUV. One SUV was listed as unlicensed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-the-turns-slow-the-straights>Fix the turns. Slow the straights.</h3><p>This board’s map points to repeat sites: Pennsylvania Avenue, Linden Boulevard, Crescent Street, and the 1000 block of Sutter Avenue. Daylighting, hardened left turns, and leading pedestrian intervals would meet the patterns at signalized corners like Pennsylvania and Blake. Speed cushions and raised crossings would answer the late‑day speeding on long straightaways. Targeted failure‑to‑yield enforcement at evening peaks would match the hours of harm. These proposals follow the local data above. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-bills-that-touch-the-brake>The bills that touch the brake</h3><p>Albany moved one step on repeat speeders. State Senator Roxanne Persaud voted yes in committee on S4045, a bill to require intelligent speed assistance after repeated violations. Twice, on May 20 and Jun 12, 2025, she backed it. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>.</p><p>At City Hall, Council Member Chris Banks co‑sponsored multiple bike‑share access bills and a notice mandate for micromobility rules. He also joined a crackdown bill on unlicensed commuter vans now in committee. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>.</p><p>The map says what to do next. Slow the default speed. Stop repeat speeders. Harden the turns where people cross. The tools exist. Use them.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell your officials to act.

On April 16, 2023, Trujillo drove his Volvo at 72 mph—nearly triple the speed limit—through a red light at Atlantic Ave and Clinton Street in Brooklyn. He struck pedestrian Katherine Harris, 31, killing her instantly, then rear-ended another car and crashed into an outdoor dining shed. Trujillo's blood alcohol level was .17, more than twice the legal limit. The article quotes Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez: "This defendant made a disastrous decision when he got behind the wheel of a car while intoxicated." The case highlights the lethal consequences of impaired driving and excessive speed, underscoring systemic risks for pedestrians in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mandates linger in outer areas. Progress, but not full victory. Some districts carved out exceptions. Housing and parking no longer clash in core neighborhoods. Vulnerable road users still face cars in many places.</p><p class=mb3>""A spokesperson for Council Member Sandy Nurse (D Brownsville) said her entire district is in the 'outer transit zone' because the Council's 'compromise [was] shaped by amendments from our district’s community boards.' 'It wasn't something that was pushed for specifically by Council Member Nurse,' spokesperson Patricia Santana told Streetsblog." -- Sandy Nurse</p><p class=mb3>On February 26, 2025, the City Council approved Mayor Adams's 'City of Yes' rezoning. The bill divided the city into zones: the Manhattan core, an inner transit zone with no parking mandates, an outer transit zone with reduced mandates, and areas beyond where mandates mostly remain. The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.' Council Member Sandy Nurse’s district saw mandates shaped by community board amendments, not her advocacy. Dan Garodnick, Department of City Planning chair, said, 'parking and housing are no longer coming into conflict in the parts of New York City that are well-served by transit.' The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others. No direct safety impact assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
