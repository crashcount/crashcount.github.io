Police are still looking for the driver. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyn-hit-and-run-driver-wanted-after-striking-man-in-street/>The man was crossing the street in Cypress Hills when he was hit by a burgundy Ford Explorer.</a></p><p>He is not alone. In the last twelve months, <strong>2 people have died and 17 have been seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>Over 1,350 have been hurt.</strong> The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.

Two people over 55 are dead.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call your council member.

Calls for barriers rose.</p><p class=mb3>On August 17, 2022, Councilmember Sandy Nurse (District 37) joined a vigil for Danny Vidal, a delivery worker killed by a truck on Morgan Avenue. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the area’s deadly record: 126 crashes, 158 injuries since 2011. The matter title reads, 'He was only 30: Family and friends gather to mourn Danny Vidal, deliverista killed in Bushwick.' Nurse called the city’s inaction 'a failure of our city government to protect these lives.' Councilmember Jennifer Gutierrez stressed that Bushwick’s industrial character does not excuse neglect. Attendees, including Los Deliveristas Unidos and the Workers Justice Project, demanded protected bike lanes, traffic lights, and barriers. The unprotected, painted lanes failed to shield Vidal. Advocates pressed the city to act before more lives are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
