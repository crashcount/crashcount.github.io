She died there. The police listed failure to yield and distraction. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> records it as CrashID 4788343.</p><p>They were one of 13 people killed on the streets of Brooklyn CB5 since Jan 1, 2022, with 5,188 injured. Pedestrians account for 7 of those deaths; cyclists for 1. The city’s dataset shows 62 serious injuries across modes here in that period, with 8 serious cases clustered at 1000 Sutter Avenue. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Pennsylvania Avenue and Linden Boulevard carry the hurt: 419 injuries combined, and four deaths tied to Pennsylvania alone in the rollup of locations. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=where-the-danger-rises-each-day>Where the danger rises each day</h3><p>Harm peaks late day. Injuries stack up from 2 PM through 8 PM, with another spike at 9 PM and into the night. Deaths crest around the commute hours, including five at 4–6 PM and 8–10 PM in this data window. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Failure to yield shows up in the records. So does aggressive driving. Unsafe speed appears too. These are named factors in the CB5 rollup. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=streets-and-bodies>Streets and bodies</h3><p>On July 13, 2025, about 12:30 AM near 395 Gateway Drive, a 21‑year‑old pedestrian died. The driver was recorded for distraction and unsafe speed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On July 3, 2025, just before 10 PM at Broadway and East New York Avenue, a 36‑year‑old pedestrian was killed at the intersection. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Apr 29, 2025, around 8 PM at Pennsylvania and Seaview, a 28‑year‑old driver was killed in a crash involving a pickup and an SUV. One SUV was listed as unlicensed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-the-turns-slow-the-straights>Fix the turns. Slow the straights.</h3><p>This board’s map points to repeat sites: Pennsylvania Avenue, Linden Boulevard, Crescent Street, and the 1000 block of Sutter Avenue. Daylighting, hardened left turns, and leading pedestrian intervals would meet the patterns at signalized corners like Pennsylvania and Blake. Speed cushions and raised crossings would answer the late‑day speeding on long straightaways. Targeted failure‑to‑yield enforcement at evening peaks would match the hours of harm. These proposals follow the local data above. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-bills-that-touch-the-brake>The bills that touch the brake</h3><p>Albany moved one step on repeat speeders. State Senator Roxanne Persaud voted yes in committee on S4045, a bill to require intelligent speed assistance after repeated violations. Twice, on May 20 and Jun 12, 2025, she backed it. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>.</p><p>At City Hall, Council Member Chris Banks co‑sponsored multiple bike‑share access bills and a notice mandate for micromobility rules. He also joined a crackdown bill on unlicensed commuter vans now in committee. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>.</p><p>The map says what to do next. Slow the default speed. Stop repeat speeders. Harden the turns where people cross. The tools exist. Use them.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell your officials to act.
