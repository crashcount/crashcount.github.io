She was crossing. She did not make it to the other side. A 72-year-old woman died at Flatbush and 5th, struck by a taxi. An 18-year-old, riding in a sedan on Court Street, never got out of the car alive. In the last twelve months, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in Brooklyn CB6. The names fade, but the pain does not. In the same period, 495 people were hurt. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-rising>The Numbers: Relentless and Rising</h3><p>953 crashes. 495 injuries. 2 deaths. In just one year. The old, the young, the in-between. No one is spared. Cars and trucks do most of the damage: 1 killed, 3 seriously hurt by cars and SUVs; 1 killed by a truck. Bikes and motorcycles wound, but the deadliest machines are still the biggest.

The city promises to heal it. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The plan: center-running bus lanes, pedestrian islands, fewer car lanes. The city calls it a &ldquo;world-class, welcoming corridor for everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>But the work is not done. DOT did not share a block-by-block plan. Parking may stay. Bus lanes may not be protected. &ldquo;The goal is to make Flatbush Avenue &lsquo;a high performing transit priority street that connects various Brooklyn neighborhoods&rsquo; rather than a road that merely moves cars between Brooklyn and Manhattan,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/09/flatbush-ave-could-be-brooklyns-first-great-transitway-if-its-done-right>said DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu</a>.</p><p>55 people have been killed or severely injured on Flatbush since 2019. The city says it will finish the project in 2025. The dead cannot wait.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-demand-more-demand-now>What You Can Do: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bus lanes and crosswalks that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill sits in the Assembly, awaiting committee action. Its summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during an eighteen month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C. Carroll, and Sarahana Shrestha. The bill cracks down on repeat offenders, forcing them to install technology that blocks speeding.

The streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On August 18, 2023, Council Member Shahana Hanif condemned Mayor Adams’s approach to street safety after the death of Jose Guerrero, the 22nd cyclist killed in New York City this year. Guerrero was struck by a Honda CRV while cycling in Brooklyn and died from his injuries. The 74-year-old driver was not charged. Hanif stated, 'We have been proactive and pushing against what this mayor is doing to undo street safety. We need to have the political courage across all levels of government to create a city that is walkable, prioritizes pedestrians, and ends these senseless murders.' Eric McClure of StreetsPAC added, 'Any death is a tragedy and [the] deaths so far this year is a really significant number. We need to do better.' The Adams administration has focused on pedestrian fatality reductions, but activists and council members demand urgent, systemic change as cyclist deaths reach a decades-high peak.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Local leaders demand fewer cars, safer streets, and real change.</p><p class=mb3>On August 18, 2023, civic groups and local officials criticized Mayor Adams’s Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) plan. The Department of Transportation (DOT) unveiled three concepts for the Atlantic Avenue interchange, restoring three lanes each way and adding a new off-ramp on Hicks Street. The coalition’s letter called this 'extremely misguided.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said the proposals 'don’t improve safety, they don’t improve traffic, and they certainly don’t improve any of the surrounding communities.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon backed a corridor-wide approach and prolonging the cantilever’s life for better planning. The groups urge immediate repairs, less traffic, and more transit. DOT Press Secretary Vin Barone defended the plan, citing federal funding and green space. The community’s message is clear: the city’s current approach puts vulnerable road users at risk and fails to meet safety or environmental needs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill demanded action—100 new devices each year. It called for a hard look at results. But the session ended. The bill died. Streets wait. Pedestrians keep crossing in the dark.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1151-2023, introduced August 3, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, aimed to require the Department of Transportation to install at least 100 illuminated, solar-powered traffic control devices at crosswalks each year for five years—a total of 500. The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The city’s crosswalks remain unchanged. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
