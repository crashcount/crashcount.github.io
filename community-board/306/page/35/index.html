The city promises to heal it. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The plan: center-running bus lanes, pedestrian islands, fewer car lanes. The city calls it a &ldquo;world-class, welcoming corridor for everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>But the work is not done. DOT did not share a block-by-block plan. Parking may stay. Bus lanes may not be protected. &ldquo;The goal is to make Flatbush Avenue &lsquo;a high performing transit priority street that connects various Brooklyn neighborhoods&rsquo; rather than a road that merely moves cars between Brooklyn and Manhattan,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/09/flatbush-ave-could-be-brooklyns-first-great-transitway-if-its-done-right>said DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu</a>.</p><p>55 people have been killed or severely injured on Flatbush since 2019. The city says it will finish the project in 2025. The dead cannot wait.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-demand-more-demand-now>What You Can Do: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bus lanes and crosswalks that put people first.

They push for safer batteries, charging stations, and delivery app accountability. Bans threaten jobs and homes but do not stop fires. Federal funds and new laws aim to protect workers and tenants.</p><p class=mb3>On August 17, 2022, Council Member Gale Brewer began drafting legislation to counter a proposed New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) ban on e-bikes. The bill, not yet numbered, is in early stages. Brewer’s proposal would ban second-hand or refurbished batteries, boost Fire Department outreach, and require delivery apps like Uber and DoorDash to pay for safer batteries. The matter summary warns that a blanket ban 'would worsen the city’s homelessness crisis by forcing residents to choose between a roof over their head and a job, and still not solve the problem of lithium-ion batteries catching fire.' Council Member Alexa Avilés called for a citywide approach. Tenant leader Cynthia Tibbs and Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project also oppose the ban, urging secure charging hubs. Senator Chuck Schumer highlighted federal funding for safer infrastructure. The public can comment on the NYCHA policy until September 6. Advocates argue that bans punish workers and tenants without fixing systemic battery dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by nydailynews.com, focused on transit, congestion pricing, and infrastructure. The debate summary reads: “Transit issues like congestion pricing dominated part of the debate, with the candidates voicing broad support for Albany’s policy of charging drivers who enter Manhattan below 60th St.” Rivera supported congestion pricing but suggested possible incentives for electric vehicles. Other candidates called for exemptions and community input on infrastructure projects like the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. No formal safety analysis was provided.

The plan, a priority for the Adams administration and MTA, aims to speed up the B41 bus from Downtown Brooklyn to Marine Park. Narcisse and Councilmember Rita Joseph joined Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference, riding the B41 and speaking with riders. Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored in the State Senate by Andrew Gounardes, passed in Albany and was signed by Governor Hochul in June. The measure extends the program for three years and ends the old rule that shut cameras off overnight and on weekends. The Department of Transportation has installed about 2,000 cameras in 750 school zones. The bill’s summary: 'expands the safety technology around the clock.' Gounardes said, 'Your right to speed does not supersede anyone’s rights to live on the streets safely.' Mayor Eric Adams joined advocates to celebrate, stating, 'A city that never sleeps deserves a camera system that won’t take a nap.' DOT data shows 59% of traffic deaths happened during off hours.

The measure, championed by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, requires pre-licensing courses and written exams to include instruction on the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians. The bill's summary states it aims to 'educate drivers about the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians and will create a thoughtful road culture going forward.' Gounardes sponsored the bill, which takes effect in January. Until now, the driver's manual offered only a single page on sharing the road. The law directs the state to consult law enforcement, advocates, and medical experts to shape the curriculum. Hochul said, 'This law will help prevent crashes and save lives.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, led by Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, updates the five-hour pre-licensing course and driver's manual. The matter summary states: 'The law addresses a longstanding gap in driver education, which had previously left generations of motorists with little awareness of road-sharing with pedestrians and cyclists.' Gov. Hochul said, 'It is common sense to make pedestrian and bike safety education mandatory for drivers.' Gounardes noted that driver instruction had not kept pace with the growing presence of cyclists and micro-mobility users. In 2021, driver inexperience contributed to over 2,500 injury crashes in NYC. The law took 11 years to pass, reflecting persistent advocacy for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Trust in government fades. Public space remains a broken pledge.</p><p class=mb3>On July 15, 2022, advocates and Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called out Greenland Forest City Partners for failing to deliver on the Pacific Park (Atlantic Yards) project in Brooklyn. The developer missed the May deadline for the promised 'Urban Room,' a glass-enclosed public space meant to serve heavy foot traffic. Only a fraction of affordable housing is built. The centerpiece park is missing. Simon demanded Empire State Development (ESD) sanction the developer or renegotiate terms for safer streets and better public space. As Simon put it, 'This is a bad actor that needs to be held accountable.' ESD claims it will work with the developer, but trust is thin. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk in one of Brooklyn’s most dangerous corridors. The state’s failure to enforce commitments leaves vulnerable road users exposed and public trust shattered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
