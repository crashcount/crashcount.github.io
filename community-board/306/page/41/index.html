State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called the grade unacceptable, urging passage of his road-sharing training bill and support for Sen. Brad Hoylman’s bill to lower speed limits. Gounardes also pushed to keep speed cameras active. Advocates like Jon Orcutt acknowledged progress, such as the MTA’s bike strategy and new greenway funding, but stressed the need for stronger laws.

The process lets residents as young as 11 vote on capital and expense projects. The official matter title: 'Voting for Participatory Budgeting is open in five Brooklyn districts until April 10.' Joseph, along with councilmembers Jennifer Gutiérrez (34), Chi Ossé (36), Alexa Avilés (38), and Shahana Hanif (39), offers in-person and online voting. Projects range from park upgrades to school improvements. Final results will be announced the week of April 17. Participatory Budgeting shapes how public money is spent, but the safety impact for vulnerable road users depends on which projects win.

State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year.
