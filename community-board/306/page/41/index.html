Twenty more are seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been <strong>over 3,500 crashes</strong>. Each one is a story cut short, a life changed, a family left waiting for someone who will not come home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. An 83-year-old woman, struck by a truck turning on Bond Street. A 72-year-old woman, killed by a taxi at Flatbush and 5th. A young passenger, 18, lost to speed at Court and Atlantic. The details are spare. The pain is not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed two people and left 187 others with injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt 11. Bikes injured 13. The street is not a fair fight. The bigger machine wins (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-the-wait>Leadership: Words, Votes, and the Wait</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. <strong>Senator Andrew Gounardes voted to renew speed cameras in school zones, calling them a way to &ldquo;keep New Yorkers safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>said Gounardes</a>). Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon co-sponsored bills to expand camera enforcement (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>expand camera enforcement</a>) and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">require speed limiters for repeat offenders</a>. These are steps. But the carnage continues.</p><p>The verdict is in. <strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> But cameras alone are not enough. The dead do not care about pilot programs or press releases. They care about crossing the street and making it home.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure of will. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Crashes spike at night and on weekends. Cameras catch reckless drivers. Fewer end up in the ER. The fix is partial, but it will save lives.</p><p class=mb3>On May 21, 2022, State Senator Andrew Gounardes endorsed a legislative deal to allow speed cameras in 750 New York City school zones to operate 24/7. The measure, awaiting City Council and state approval, aims to keep cameras running nights and weekends—when 41% of crashes occur. The matter summary states: 'the Legislature is poised to do the right thing and allow the speed cameras...to keep operating around the clock.' Gounardes, a key advocate, joins Mayor Adams and crash victims’ families in support. The endorsement highlights that automated enforcement cuts reckless driving and reduces injuries. The deal falls short by lacking escalating penalties for repeat speeders and lasting only three years. Still, keeping cameras on at all hours is the most important fix, targeting the deadliest times for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Adams called the deal 'a major victory,' but advocates like Eric McClure of StreetsPAC said, 'it’s not enough.' The City Council must submit a home rule message before final passage.

The legislative session nears its end with no clear action. State Sen. Jabari Brisport supports the bill, calling for round-the-clock enforcement. Sen. John Liu backs maintaining cameras but won’t commit to S5602. Some City Council members demand that camera revenue fund local road improvements. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried doubts the Council will send the required home rule message in time, while Assembly Member William Magnarelli promises to advance the bill if they do. Mayor Adams’ team claims safety was discussed in Albany, but the mayor himself stayed silent. The bill faces opposition over increased penalties and insurance notifications.

Senator Gounardes pushes to renew and expand the program. Cameras now guard schools, but the law may expire. Advocates demand more hours, tougher penalties. The clock ticks. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill (no number given) led by State Senator Andrew Gounardes faces debate in Albany as of May 13, 2022. The bill seeks to renew and strengthen New York City’s school speed zone camera program, which is set to expire June 2. The measure would expand camera hours to 24/7 and increase penalties for repeat offenders, including insurance notification and license suspension. The committee and current status are not specified, but only nine legislative days remain. The bill summary states: 'New York City officials are in conflict with state lawmakers in Albany over the future of school speed zone cameras.' Gounardes is confident in renewal. Mayor Eric Adams and advocates want home rule for NYC on speed cameras and speed limits, but Albany resists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez urges lawmakers to use every tool to fight reckless driving. The bill’s fate will shape the city’s ability to protect pedestrians and cyclists from speeding drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in May 2022, aims to allow 24/7 automated enforcement and add penalties for repeat offenders, including registration suspensions. The matter summary: 'DOT officials said they’re negotiating amendments to Gounardes’ bill that would further crack down on reckless drivers, including a provision to let the city install cameras to ticket cars in bike lanes.' Gounardes stressed urgency: 'We cannot leave Albany without reauthorizing the speed cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s late push for home rule caused confusion, risking the program’s renewal. The bill is under negotiation as the legislative session nears its end. Eleven people died on city streets that week, underscoring the stakes for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July. Assembly Member William Magnarelli, chair of the Transportation Committee, blamed City Hall for inaction. Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo. Without home rule, New York City’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—face continued risk from political delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
