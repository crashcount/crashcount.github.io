An 18-year-old, riding in a sedan on Court Street, never got out of the car alive. In the last twelve months, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in Brooklyn CB6.

The city promises to heal it. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The plan: center-running bus lanes, pedestrian islands, fewer car lanes. The city calls it a &ldquo;world-class, welcoming corridor for everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>But the work is not done. DOT did not share a block-by-block plan. Parking may stay. Bus lanes may not be protected. &ldquo;The goal is to make Flatbush Avenue &lsquo;a high performing transit priority street that connects various Brooklyn neighborhoods&rsquo; rather than a road that merely moves cars between Brooklyn and Manhattan,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/09/flatbush-ave-could-be-brooklyns-first-great-transitway-if-its-done-right>said DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu</a>.</p><p>55 people have been killed or severely injured on Flatbush since 2019.

The matter, titled 'Merchants call for compromise as Park Slope Open Streets program faces scrutiny,' centers on the proposed closure of Fifth Avenue every Saturday from May to October. Hanif’s action: gathering input and relaying concerns to the Department of Transportation (DOT) before a final decision. The survey showed strong public support—455 out of 489 respondents favored the program—but merchant opinions split. Some praised increased foot traffic and sales; others reported steep losses. Critics cited business access, traffic, and e-bike safety. Merchants petitioned Hanif and DOT for a thorough review and recovery plan. Community Board 6’s Mike Racioppo recommended proper funding and expansion. The DOT has not yet ruled. The debate spotlights the tension between public space and business survival.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver had a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' according to State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The bill would require speed-limiting devices for drivers with repeated offenses, targeting those with 11 or more points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall to demand action. The article notes that auto deaths have outpaced gun deaths in New York City for two years. The bill mirrors laws for drunk driving and follows stalled efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act. Governor Hochul's office declined comment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, stalled for years in Albany, gained urgency after a fatal Brooklyn crash on April 1, 2025. Gallagher, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes and city Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied at Borough Hall, urging swift passage. The bill targets drivers with 11 or more license points in 24 months, or six camera violations in a year. Gallagher said, 'A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.' Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.' The legislation mirrors past efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act, aiming to hold reckless drivers accountable and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
