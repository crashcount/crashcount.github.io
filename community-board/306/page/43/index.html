Twenty more are seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been <strong>over 3,500 crashes</strong>. Each one is a story cut short, a life changed, a family left waiting for someone who will not come home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. An 83-year-old woman, struck by a truck turning on Bond Street. A 72-year-old woman, killed by a taxi at Flatbush and 5th. A young passenger, 18, lost to speed at Court and Atlantic. The details are spare. The pain is not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed two people and left 187 others with injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt 11. Bikes injured 13. The street is not a fair fight. The bigger machine wins (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-the-wait>Leadership: Words, Votes, and the Wait</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. <strong>Senator Andrew Gounardes voted to renew speed cameras in school zones, calling them a way to &ldquo;keep New Yorkers safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>said Gounardes</a>). Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon co-sponsored bills to expand camera enforcement (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>expand camera enforcement</a>) and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">require speed limiters for repeat offenders</a>. These are steps. But the carnage continues.</p><p>The verdict is in. <strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> But cameras alone are not enough. The dead do not care about pilot programs or press releases. They care about crossing the street and making it home.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure of will. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident, covered by Streetsblog, exposed how reporting traffic violations can put New Yorkers at risk. City Hall called the harassment 'extremely disturbing' and promised to review a Department of Investigation probe, but did not commit to changing NYPD’s handling of 311 complaints. Assembly Member Robert Carroll condemned the threats and demanded accountability if city staff leaked Melone’s information. Council Member Shahana Hanif echoed concern, urging that harassment not silence those reporting dangerous driving. The NYPD did not comment. The city’s lack of action leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as illegal parking blocks sightlines, sidewalks, and bike lanes, endangering lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Restler calls the daily truck hazard urgent. Lawmakers demand swift action. The city and state must coordinate. Vulnerable road users wait.</p><p class=mb3>On January 31, 2022, DOT confirmed that weigh-in-motion (WIM) sensors for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) will take a year to install. The pilot program, enabled by a state bill signed December 22, aims to fine illegally overweight trucks. The bill was introduced by State lawmakers Brian Kavanagh and Jo Anne Simon. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, pressed for rapid installation, warning, "There are extremely overweight trucks barreling down the triple cantilever every single day that are a hazard to the health and safety of our community." The matter title states: "Tonnage sensors on the BQE will take a year to set up: DOT." The project is complex, requiring city and state DOT coordination and a 90-day grace period once operational. Vulnerable road users remain exposed while the system is delayed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored in the state legislature by Brian Kavanagh and Jo Anne Simon, was signed into law on December 22. The measure, described as a 'critical project' by DOT, aims to catch and fine overweight trucks using new sensors. Restler said, 'There are extremely overweight trucks barreling down the triple cantilever every single day that are a hazard to the health and safety of our community.' DOT claims the system will be operational by year’s end, citing technical complexity. The Brooklyn Heights Association and local officials demand faster action. The pilot is the first of its kind in the nation. Until sensors are live, the BQE remains a danger zone for everyone not behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transit saves lives.</p><p class=mb3>This funding debate centers on Gov. Hochul’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget, which allocates $6.6 billion in operating aid for the MTA but lacks new dedicated revenue. The proposal, discussed on January 28, 2022, has not advanced to a formal committee or bill stage. The matter: 'Who Wants To Give The MTA Half A Billion Dollars?' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backs progressive funding, saying, 'Funding high-ridership bus routes and the subway such that transit options would be arriving every six minutes is something we need to be pushing for.' Comptroller Brad Lander and advocates like the Riders Alliance demand $500 million per year to avoid fare hikes and boost service. The push is clear: more frequent, affordable transit keeps vulnerable New Yorkers out of harm’s way.
