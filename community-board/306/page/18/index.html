The city promises to heal it. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The plan: center-running bus lanes, pedestrian islands, fewer car lanes. The city calls it a &ldquo;world-class, welcoming corridor for everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>But the work is not done. DOT did not share a block-by-block plan. Parking may stay. Bus lanes may not be protected. &ldquo;The goal is to make Flatbush Avenue &lsquo;a high performing transit priority street that connects various Brooklyn neighborhoods&rsquo; rather than a road that merely moves cars between Brooklyn and Manhattan,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/09/flatbush-ave-could-be-brooklyns-first-great-transitway-if-its-done-right>said DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu</a>.</p><p>55 people have been killed or severely injured on Flatbush since 2019. The city says it will finish the project in 2025. The dead cannot wait.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-demand-more-demand-now>What You Can Do: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bus lanes and crosswalks that put people first.

The bill, backed by New Yorkers for Transportation Equity, was introduced last year and is under consideration. The measure’s summary promises to 'improve air quality and reduce fatal crashes.' Gounardes, representing Brooklyn’s western edge, champions the shift: 'A new approach will not only protect our climate, but also make New York a safer, more affordable place to live.' Analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute projects 593 fewer traffic deaths each year, with thousands more lives saved through active transportation. The bill’s focus is clear: less driving, more safety, cleaner air, and real savings for families.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, heard in committee, would require cruise ships at city terminals to connect to electric shore power or be barred from docking. The matter summary states: 'Fossil fuel-emitting cruise ships would have to walk the plank and abandon New York City ports unless they plug into clean shore power for energy.' Avilés, at the hearing, said, 'The Red Hook community has not seen economic benefit from this or any other cruise deal—we have seen a negative benefit, and that is traffic, unwieldy, businesses closing because workers can’t get there, honking, car crashes.' The bill also demands traffic mitigation plans for cruise departures. Residents and advocates say the city’s cruise terminals bring only pollution, congestion, and risk to vulnerable road users.

The bill, titled 'Plug it in! NYC lawmakers want diesel-powered cruise ships to connect to shore power or leave,' would force cruise ships at Red Hook and Hell’s Kitchen terminals to connect to the electric grid or be barred from docking. Avilés said, 'The Red Hook community has not seen economic benefit from this or any other cruise deal—we have seen a negative benefit, and that is traffic, unwieldy, businesses closing because workers can’t get there, honking, car crashes.' The bill targets both air pollution and the surge of car and truck traffic that endangers pedestrians and cyclists. Despite a 2017 shore power upgrade in Brooklyn, most ships still idle, spewing diesel. The Economic Development Corporation promises improvements, but locals and Avilés say the city moves too slow, putting residents at risk while cruise companies rake in profits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Alexa Avilés led the charge, criticizing the city’s $350,000 attempt to fix traffic from ships like the MSC Meraviglia. The matter summary notes, 'the neighborhood continues to experience severe gridlock.' Avilés questioned the use of taxpayer funds to subsidize cruise lines and called for accountability. She introduced legislation requiring ships to use shore power and submit traffic mitigation plans. Local business leader Susan Povich described 'hours of gridlock' and 'unsafe walking and biking conditions.' Despite city efforts—more traffic agents, ferry service—streets remain perilous for vulnerable road users. The city considers more spending, but the threat to pedestrians and cyclists persists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crossings, between Nevins and Bond, Bond and Hoyt, and Hoyt and Smith streets, add crosswalks, traffic lights, and ramps. Restler said, 'These new mid-block crossings will create a greater sense of safety and community for Boerum Hill.' The Department of Transportation acted after Restler and others demanded change following the death of Katherine Harris, killed by a speeding driver. DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks.
