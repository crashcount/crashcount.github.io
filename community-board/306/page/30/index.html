She was crossing. She did not make it to the other side. A 72-year-old woman died at Flatbush and 5th, struck by a taxi. An 18-year-old, riding in a sedan on Court Street, never got out of the car alive. In the last twelve months, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in Brooklyn CB6. The names fade, but the pain does not. In the same period, 495 people were hurt. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-rising>The Numbers: Relentless and Rising</h3><p>953 crashes. 495 injuries. 2 deaths. In just one year. The old, the young, the in-between. No one is spared. Cars and trucks do most of the damage: 1 killed, 3 seriously hurt by cars and SUVs; 1 killed by a truck. Bikes and motorcycles wound, but the deadliest machines are still the biggest.

The city promises to heal it. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The plan: center-running bus lanes, pedestrian islands, fewer car lanes. The city calls it a &ldquo;world-class, welcoming corridor for everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>But the work is not done. DOT did not share a block-by-block plan. Parking may stay. Bus lanes may not be protected. &ldquo;The goal is to make Flatbush Avenue &lsquo;a high performing transit priority street that connects various Brooklyn neighborhoods&rsquo; rather than a road that merely moves cars between Brooklyn and Manhattan,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/09/flatbush-ave-could-be-brooklyns-first-great-transitway-if-its-done-right>said DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu</a>.</p><p>55 people have been killed or severely injured on Flatbush since 2019. The city says it will finish the project in 2025. The dead cannot wait.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-demand-more-demand-now>What You Can Do: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bus lanes and crosswalks that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The councilmembers wrote, 'E-bike users include delivery workers who keep us fed, families on cargo bikes, individuals recovering from surgery, older adults, people who live in areas with fewer public transit options, those who want to limit their carbon footprint by not driving cars, and so many more.' They argue the ban unfairly targets vulnerable riders and blocks access for those who rely on e-bikes for work and daily life.

DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' In 2021, 42 people died in drunk driving crashes, up 60 percent from previous years. Officials promise enforcement and education, but their messaging targets drinking, not the act of driving.

The council members oppose the Parks Department’s policy that classifies e-bikes as motor vehicles, grouping them with SUVs and trucks. They argue this ban blocks access for delivery workers, families, older adults, and people with limited transit options. The lawmakers call for a new policy that permits e-bikes while addressing safety concerns, insisting the current rule undermines city values of accessibility and environmental care.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill remains in committee. The measure would give whistleblowers 25% of the ticket, up to $75. The matter targets drivers who obscure or remove plates to dodge automated enforcement. As city and state agencies rely more on cameras to catch speeders and red-light runners, more drivers hide their plates. The Department of Transportation says cameras failed to ticket over 4% of violators last fall, up from 1% in 2019. Advocates accuse police of lax enforcement and even breaking the law themselves. Gounardes’s bill, still stalled, aims to close this loophole and put power in the hands of citizens.
