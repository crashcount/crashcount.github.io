The city promises to heal it. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The plan: center-running bus lanes, pedestrian islands, fewer car lanes. The city calls it a &ldquo;world-class, welcoming corridor for everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>But the work is not done. DOT did not share a block-by-block plan. Parking may stay. Bus lanes may not be protected. &ldquo;The goal is to make Flatbush Avenue &lsquo;a high performing transit priority street that connects various Brooklyn neighborhoods&rsquo; rather than a road that merely moves cars between Brooklyn and Manhattan,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/09/flatbush-ave-could-be-brooklyns-first-great-transitway-if-its-done-right>said DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu</a>.</p><p>55 people have been killed or severely injured on Flatbush since 2019. The city says it will finish the project in 2025. The dead cannot wait.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-demand-more-demand-now>What You Can Do: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bus lanes and crosswalks that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The piece, titled 'A Brush With Danger Made Me Exhibit A in My Fight for Better Bike Lanes in Brooklyn,' describes the lack of protected bike lanes in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. The author recounts merging into traffic, being closely followed by a driver, and crashing on a wet, greasy iron grid. The car sped away. Passersby helped. The cyclist suffered a broken collarbone. The essay notes, 'Our area of Brooklyn is a major hole in the borough's protected bike lane network.' Council Member Shahana Hanif attended a community meeting on the issue. The call is clear: Brooklyn’s streets favor cars, not people. The absence of protected lanes leaves cyclists exposed and injured.

Bills would force grocery delivery apps to pay the $20 minimum wage. Workers ride the same streets, face the same risks. The Council’s hearing is set. Advocates demand equal pay and protection.</p><p class=mb3>On December 4, 2024, Council Members Jennifer Gutiérrez and Sandy Nurse introduced bills to the City Council’s Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection. The bills aim to close a loophole that lets grocery delivery apps like Instacart avoid paying the $20 per hour minimum wage required for restaurant deliveristas. The matter title: 'Council Seeks To Expand Minimum Wage to Grocery Deliveristas.' The hearing is scheduled for December 9. Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the Immigration Committee, called for broader protections: 'When you become a worker, you should be ensured a living wage.' Ligia Guallpa of Worker’s Justice Project said all delivery workers face significant risks and deserve safety, dignity, and respect. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection supports expanding the wage standard. Instacart opposes the bill. The Council’s action centers gig workers who ride city streets, exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Holden calls it betrayal. Poll shows narrow support. Some see a cash grab, others hope for better transit. The $9 fee hits drivers. The city waits for the impact.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2024, the MTA approved congestion pricing, set to start January 5, 2025. The plan charges $9 for cars and $14.40 for trucks entering Manhattan below 60th Street. amNew York Metro polled nearly 3,000 residents: 53.8% support, 44.9% oppose. The matter, titled 'Here’s how New Yorkers really feel about congestion pricing,' reveals sharp divides. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) condemned the move, calling it a 'blatant political move and a shameless betrayal of New Yorkers.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the plan, citing needed transit upgrades. The bill’s impact on vulnerable road users was not assessed. The debate centers on funding transit versus burdening drivers. The city stands at a crossroads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
