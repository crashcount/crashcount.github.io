She was crossing. She did not make it to the other side. A 72-year-old woman died at Flatbush and 5th, struck by a taxi. An 18-year-old, riding in a sedan on Court Street, never got out of the car alive. In the last twelve months, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in Brooklyn CB6. The names fade, but the pain does not. In the same period, 495 people were hurt. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-rising>The Numbers: Relentless and Rising</h3><p>953 crashes. 495 injuries. 2 deaths. In just one year. The old, the young, the in-between. No one is spared. Cars and trucks do most of the damage: 1 killed, 3 seriously hurt by cars and SUVs; 1 killed by a truck. Bikes and motorcycles wound, but the deadliest machines are still the biggest.

The city promises to heal it. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The plan: center-running bus lanes, pedestrian islands, fewer car lanes. The city calls it a &ldquo;world-class, welcoming corridor for everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>But the work is not done. DOT did not share a block-by-block plan. Parking may stay. Bus lanes may not be protected. &ldquo;The goal is to make Flatbush Avenue &lsquo;a high performing transit priority street that connects various Brooklyn neighborhoods&rsquo; rather than a road that merely moves cars between Brooklyn and Manhattan,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/09/flatbush-ave-could-be-brooklyns-first-great-transitway-if-its-done-right>said DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu</a>.</p><p>55 people have been killed or severely injured on Flatbush since 2019. The city says it will finish the project in 2025. The dead cannot wait.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-demand-more-demand-now>What You Can Do: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bus lanes and crosswalks that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The driver, Faheem Shabazz, had a record of speeding violations. Gounardes, a safe streets advocate, said, 'That's really what this conversation should be about—how are we holding people accountable when they have violations to their record and zero consequences for it.' He supports lowering speed limits and tougher penalties but stressed that enforcement is lacking. Senator Iwen Chu urged the NYC DOT to study the area for safety upgrades, stating, 'We must recognize that our streets need to be designed with safety in mind.' The DOT is reviewing the intersection. The call is clear: repeat offenders face little consequence, and street design still puts pedestrians at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transparency demanded.</p><p class=mb3>On September 7, 2023, the MTA faced backlash for failing to deliver on its pledge of eight-minute weekday headways for the R train in southern Brooklyn. The issue, reported by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, surfaced after riders complained of waits as long as 16 minutes. The MTA had announced service upgrades, but later changed its press release, citing F line track work as the cause for delay—work unrelated to the R train. Gounardes, who fought for MTA funding in Albany, accused the agency of misrepresenting the improvements, saying, 'I’m shocked and frustrated that the MTA would misrepresent these service upgrades to the riding public.' Transit advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance echoed calls for honesty: 'Public transit shouldn’t be a rollercoaster of mismatched expectations.' The incident has strained relations between the MTA and its legislative supporters, highlighting the need for transparency and reliability in transit service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
