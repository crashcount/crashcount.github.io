Twenty more are seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been <strong>over 3,500 crashes</strong>. Each one is a story cut short, a life changed, a family left waiting for someone who will not come home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. An 83-year-old woman, struck by a truck turning on Bond Street. A 72-year-old woman, killed by a taxi at Flatbush and 5th. A young passenger, 18, lost to speed at Court and Atlantic. The details are spare. The pain is not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed two people and left 187 others with injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt 11. Bikes injured 13. The street is not a fair fight. The bigger machine wins (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-the-wait>Leadership: Words, Votes, and the Wait</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. <strong>Senator Andrew Gounardes voted to renew speed cameras in school zones, calling them a way to &ldquo;keep New Yorkers safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>said Gounardes</a>). Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon co-sponsored bills to expand camera enforcement (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>expand camera enforcement</a>) and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">require speed limiters for repeat offenders</a>. These are steps. But the carnage continues.</p><p>The verdict is in. <strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> But cameras alone are not enough. The dead do not care about pilot programs or press releases. They care about crossing the street and making it home.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure of will. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The system fails those who need it most.</p><p class=mb3>On February 23, 2024, at a press conference, Brooklyn State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon condemned lawsuits blocking the MTA’s congestion pricing plan. The matter, titled 'Congestion Pricing Opponents Are Blocking Disabled Access to Mass Transit, Politicians Charge,' highlights how legal challenges from New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, the United Federation of Teachers, and others have forced the MTA to halt critical accessibility upgrades. Gounardes declared, 'That’s not gonna happen if the money’s not there.' The MTA earmarked $6 billion for accessibility, aiming to make 70 stations ADA accessible and modernize 78 elevators. Disability advocates like Elizabeth Valdez and Joe Rappaport stressed that most disabled New Yorkers rely on subways and buses, not private cars. Christopher Schuyler noted congestion pricing would speed up paratransit and wheelchair-accessible vehicles. Without funding, the city’s most vulnerable remain stranded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, backed by New Yorkers for Transportation Equity, was introduced last year and is under consideration. The measure’s summary promises to 'improve air quality and reduce fatal crashes.' Gounardes, representing Brooklyn’s western edge, champions the shift: 'A new approach will not only protect our climate, but also make New York a safer, more affordable place to live.' Analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute projects 593 fewer traffic deaths each year, with thousands more lives saved through active transportation. The bill’s focus is clear: less driving, more safety, cleaner air, and real savings for families.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsored by Timothy M. Kennedy with support from Jake Ashby, Jamaal Bailey, and others, the bill mandates street designs that protect everyone—not just drivers. The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The bill marks a shift away from car-first planning, forcing cities to build streets for people, not just traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes warns, 'If we’re just going to use that money to double down on the transportation of the past, on just purely automobile usage, we’re making a great mistake.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit.

The city’s hand finally moves after years of blood.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced new mid-block pedestrian crossings on Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn’s so-called 'Boulevard of Death.' The crossings, between Nevins and Bond, Bond and Hoyt, and Hoyt and Smith streets, add crosswalks, traffic lights, and ramps. Restler said, 'These new mid-block crossings will create a greater sense of safety and community for Boerum Hill.' The Department of Transportation acted after Restler and others demanded change following the death of Katherine Harris, killed by a speeding driver. DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks. Leaders want more: curb extensions, redesigned crossings, and further traffic calming. Atlantic Avenue remains a battleground for the city’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
