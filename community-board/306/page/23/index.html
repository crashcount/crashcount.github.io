Twenty more are seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been <strong>over 3,500 crashes</strong>. Each one is a story cut short, a life changed, a family left waiting for someone who will not come home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. An 83-year-old woman, struck by a truck turning on Bond Street. A 72-year-old woman, killed by a taxi at Flatbush and 5th. A young passenger, 18, lost to speed at Court and Atlantic. The details are spare. The pain is not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed two people and left 187 others with injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt 11. Bikes injured 13. The street is not a fair fight. The bigger machine wins (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-the-wait>Leadership: Words, Votes, and the Wait</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. <strong>Senator Andrew Gounardes voted to renew speed cameras in school zones, calling them a way to &ldquo;keep New Yorkers safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>said Gounardes</a>). Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon co-sponsored bills to expand camera enforcement (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>expand camera enforcement</a>) and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">require speed limiters for repeat offenders</a>. These are steps. But the carnage continues.</p><p>The verdict is in. <strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> But cameras alone are not enough. The dead do not care about pilot programs or press releases. They care about crossing the street and making it home.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure of will. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Warehouses choke streets. Black and Latino residents breathe the fumes and dodge danger. Lawmakers push the Clean Deliveries Act to curb the chaos. The burden falls hard. The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>The Clean Deliveries Act, now under consideration in Albany, aims to regulate last-mile warehouse traffic and emissions across New York State. The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A taxi traveling eastbound collided with the center back end of a box truck also traveling eastbound. The taxi driver was cited for 'Following Too Closely' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The taxi carried three occupants; the 39-year-old female driver and a 60-year-old female right rear passenger were injured, suffering neck and back injuries respectively. Both occupants were restrained with lap belts and harnesses and were not ejected. The box truck had one male occupant who was not reported injured. Vehicle damage was centered on the front end of the box truck and the rear end of the taxi. The crash highlights driver error—specifically failure to maintain safe distance and attention—as the cause of injury to vulnerable passengers inside the taxi.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

MTA and DOT pass the buck.</p><p class=mb3>On January 15, 2024, Council Member Justin Brannan (District 47) called for a contingency traffic plan to address chaos during Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge closures. The matter, titled 'Bay Ridge pols call for help with traffic build-up caused by Verrazzano Bridge closures,' highlights gridlock and reckless driving on residential streets. Brannan, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, pressed the MTA and DOT for early closure notifications and more traffic control. Brannan warned, 'Frustrated drivers... driving up on the sidewalk... affects not just the average driver or pedestrian but... first responders.' Gounardes added, 'Buses literally could not go anywhere.' Local leaders echoed the need for action. The MTA claimed safety as the reason for closures but shifted responsibility for street management to the DOT. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided, but the call centers the danger to pedestrians, transit riders, and emergency crews.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers move. The Clean Deliveries Act aims to cut emissions from sprawling e-commerce warehouses. Kristen Gonzalez and others demand action. Diesel trucks crowd narrow streets. Pollution and danger rise. Residents pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>Bill: Clean Deliveries Act. Announced November 29, 2023. Status: Proposed. Committee: Not specified. Lawmakers, including State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez (District 59), call for strict regulation of emissions from last-mile e-commerce warehouses. The bill would require environmental reviews for warehouses over 50,000 square feet, mandate plans to cut air pollution, and push for zero-emission delivery vehicles. Gonzalez said, 'The unchecked growth of large warehouses in neighborhoods across NYC has worsened air quality, noise pollution, and traffic safety for everyday New Yorkers.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, a co-sponsor, highlighted the link between warehouse traffic, pollution, and traffic violence. The Red Hook Business Alliance and community advocates back the bill, citing heavy truck traffic, poor air, and threats to safety in working-class neighborhoods. The legislation aims to hold warehouse operators accountable and protect residents from the mounting toll of delivery-driven pollution and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
