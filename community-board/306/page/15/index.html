Twenty more are seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been <strong>over 3,500 crashes</strong>. Each one is a story cut short, a life changed, a family left waiting for someone who will not come home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. An 83-year-old woman, struck by a truck turning on Bond Street. A 72-year-old woman, killed by a taxi at Flatbush and 5th. A young passenger, 18, lost to speed at Court and Atlantic. The details are spare. The pain is not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed two people and left 187 others with injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt 11. Bikes injured 13. The street is not a fair fight. The bigger machine wins (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-the-wait>Leadership: Words, Votes, and the Wait</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. <strong>Senator Andrew Gounardes voted to renew speed cameras in school zones, calling them a way to &ldquo;keep New Yorkers safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>said Gounardes</a>). Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon co-sponsored bills to expand camera enforcement (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>expand camera enforcement</a>) and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">require speed limiters for repeat offenders</a>. These are steps. But the carnage continues.</p><p>The verdict is in. <strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> But cameras alone are not enough. The dead do not care about pilot programs or press releases. They care about crossing the street and making it home.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure of will. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The fight shapes the future for housing, space, and city life.</p><p class=mb3>On October 3, 2024, the City Council began reviewing Mayor Adams’s City of Yes zoning reform, focusing on the elimination of mandatory parking requirements for new developments. The proposal, under the Town Center Zoning plan, aims to boost small-scale, mixed-use housing. Council Members Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler voiced strong support, with Hanif stating, 'Parking mandates block housing, they block extra space for the folks living in communities, they block plazas, and the ability to live in a climate friendly city.' Restler called the policy vital for Brooklyn. Department of City Planning Director Dan Garodnick acknowledged the importance of removing parking mandates but noted the plan could proceed without it. The Council faces pushback from low-density, transit-poor areas. Progressive groups and experts argue that ending parking mandates is overdue and would reshape housing, public space, and climate policy citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The funding, praised by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Mayor Eric Adams, aims to 'revitalize the Brooklyn Marine Terminal,' reduce truck traffic, and modernize infrastructure. The NYC Economic Development Corporation took over BMT from the Port Authority in May. U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler warned the deal could increase truck traffic and threaten jobs, but stressed the port's importance. The grant targets repairs, modernization, and traffic reduction.
