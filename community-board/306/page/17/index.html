She was crossing. She did not make it to the other side. A 72-year-old woman died at Flatbush and 5th, struck by a taxi. An 18-year-old, riding in a sedan on Court Street, never got out of the car alive. In the last twelve months, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in Brooklyn CB6. The names fade, but the pain does not. In the same period, 495 people were hurt. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-rising>The Numbers: Relentless and Rising</h3><p>953 crashes. 495 injuries. 2 deaths. In just one year. The old, the young, the in-between. No one is spared. Cars and trucks do most of the damage: 1 killed, 3 seriously hurt by cars and SUVs; 1 killed by a truck. Bikes and motorcycles wound, but the deadliest machines are still the biggest.

The city promises to heal it. &ldquo;Right now, Flatbush Avenue above Prospect Park doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The plan: center-running bus lanes, pedestrian islands, fewer car lanes. The city calls it a &ldquo;world-class, welcoming corridor for everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>But the work is not done. DOT did not share a block-by-block plan. Parking may stay. Bus lanes may not be protected. &ldquo;The goal is to make Flatbush Avenue &lsquo;a high performing transit priority street that connects various Brooklyn neighborhoods&rsquo; rather than a road that merely moves cars between Brooklyn and Manhattan,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/09/flatbush-ave-could-be-brooklyns-first-great-transitway-if-its-done-right>said DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu</a>.</p><p>55 people have been killed or severely injured on Flatbush since 2019. The city says it will finish the project in 2025. The dead cannot wait.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-demand-more-demand-now>What You Can Do: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bus lanes and crosswalks that put people first.

Council Members Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Alexa Avilés, and Tiffany Cabán back the measure.

As of 2022, only 4,858 out of 95,129 FHVs were wheelchair accessible, and just 1% were all-electric.
