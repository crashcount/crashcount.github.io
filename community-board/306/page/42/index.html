They want special permits to drop parking. They say parking rules drive up costs, block affordable homes, and fuel car use. The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident, covered by Streetsblog, exposed how reporting traffic violations can put New Yorkers at risk. City Hall called the harassment 'extremely disturbing' and promised to review a Department of Investigation probe, but did not commit to changing NYPD’s handling of 311 complaints. Assembly Member Robert Carroll condemned the threats and demanded accountability if city staff leaked Melone’s information. Council Member Shahana Hanif echoed concern, urging that harassment not silence those reporting dangerous driving. The NYPD did not comment. The city’s lack of action leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as illegal parking blocks sightlines, sidewalks, and bike lanes, endangering lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes backs progressive funding, saying, 'Funding high-ridership bus routes and the subway such that transit options would be arriving every six minutes is something we need to be pushing for.' Comptroller Brad Lander and advocates like the Riders Alliance demand $500 million per year to avoid fare hikes and boost service. The push is clear: more frequent, affordable transit keeps vulnerable New Yorkers out of harm’s way.

The matter, titled 'Crossing the Street Should Not Be a Matter of Life and Death,' highlights the failure of current street design. Hanif, representing the district where Muschamp died, pledges to fight for safer streets. She calls for preventive design—daylighting, mid-block chicanes, leading pedestrian intervals, pedestrian-only crossings, and safety islands. Hanif opposes relying on punitive enforcement, saying, 'Planning streets for people means designs that force drivers to drive slowly and carefully.' She urges the Council and new administration to act, stating, 'Our streets are dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists because they are planned for cars, not people.' Hanif’s stance centers vulnerable road users and demands systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
