Nearly a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year alone, Brooklyn CB17 has seen 1,345 crashes. Thirteen left people with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs and silent phones.</p><p>Maurette Lafleur, 68, was crossing Rutland Road with the light. A Mercedes turned left and struck her. She died in the crosswalk. The driver stayed. No charges. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/woman-68-fatally-struck-by-mercedes-driver-in-brooklyn-crosswalk/>described</a> the horror: &ldquo;I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching.&rdquo; The city moved on.</p><p>A pregnant woman was killed in a hit-and-run.

Trucks and vans killed two.</strong> In total, eight people have died since 2022. More than 3,200 have been injured. Most were walking. Some were cycling. Many were children or seniors. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h2><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They point to <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>new intersection designs</a> and say, &ldquo;Redesigning our streets under Vision Zero has helped us reduce traffic deaths to historic lows but we are always looking for new ways to keep people safe.&rdquo; But the dead keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders face expiration. The law to keep them running is stalled.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Every injury is a warning. Every death is a failure to act.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand permanent speed cameras. Demand streets where the most vulnerable come first.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.
