Since 2022, eleven people are dead here. Seven were walking. One was biking. Two were riding small motors. One was in a car. In the same span, 3,700-plus were hurt. These are the city’s own numbers.</p><p><strong>Nights take more.</strong> From 7 p.m. to midnight, deaths pile up, with peaks at 7, 9, 10 and 11 p.m. The hour of 7 p.m. has three deaths. Nine p.m. has one. Ten p.m. has one. Eleven p.m. has one. Injuries swell through the late afternoon and evening, then keep coming after dark. That is the pattern.</p><h3 id=linden-and-church-names-you-dont-forget>Linden and Church: names you don’t forget</h3><p>Linden Boulevard cuts long and wide. It leads the harm count here: one death, 129 injuries. Church Avenue shows two deaths and 165 injuries. Utica Avenue adds 82 injured. Tilden Avenue holds fewer injuries but five serious ones. These corridors are not rumors; they are on the city’s map.</p><p>At Church and East 95th, a 68‑year‑old woman crossed with the signal. A left‑turning sedan hit her. She died there. The record lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” At Church and Kings Highway, a man crossing against the light was struck by a sedan at unsafe speed. He died. The light changed. He did not.</p><h3 id=riders-thrown-bodies-broken>Riders thrown, bodies broken</h3><p>On Linden at Church, a bus and an e‑scooter met. The e‑scooter rider, 44, was ejected. He was listed as unlicensed. He died. On Clarendon Road near East 35th, a moped rider, 34, was ejected in a crash with an SUV. He died of crush injuries. On Church at East 55th, an SUV hit a pedestrian in the crosswalk. He died. The file notes “Alcohol Involvement.” The street does not explain. It only records.</p><h3 id=what-the-clock-says>What the clock says</h3><p>Harm swells after school and work. Injuries climb from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m., then the deaths come on. The numbers at 7 p.m. are worst: three killed, 203 injured. Nine p.m. to 11 p.m. holds more dead and the kind of injuries that change a life. The file shows it hour by hour.</p><h3 id=what-hits-you-here>What hits you here</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the striking. Sedans alone account for four pedestrian deaths and 247 pedestrian injuries. SUVs add one death and 191 injuries. Trucks and buses together add two pedestrian deaths. People outside vehicles pay the price: seven pedestrians dead, one cyclist dead, one rider on a moped/e‑scooter dead. That is how the tally breaks.</p><p>The listed causes read plain: “other” dominates injury counts. Then “vulnerable road user error.” Then inattention. Failure to yield. Unsafe speed appears in the deadly files. Each entry is a line on a coroner’s ledger.</p><h3 id=promises-and-votes>Promises and votes</h3><p>At City Hall, Council Member Farah N. Louis put her name on a bill to force the city to install school‑zone traffic devices within 60 days of a determination. She also co‑sponsored a crackdown on unlicensed commuter vans. These are moves on the edges but they are on the record.</p><p>In Albany, State Sen. Kevin Parker voted yes in committee for the Stop Super Speeders bill that would force repeat violators to install speed‑limiting tech. It passed committee. The bill targets drivers with patterns of tickets and points. It is meant for the 1.5 percent who do a lot of the killing.</p><h3 id=what-will-stop-the-bleeding>What will stop the bleeding</h3><p>Start where the bodies fall: Linden Boulevard, Church Avenue, Utica Avenue, Tilden Avenue. Daylight every corner. Give pedestrians a head start at signals. Harden left turns. Narrow lanes. Add refuge where people cross long runs. Work the late‑day and night hours with targeted enforcement at these exact blocks.</p><p>Then take the citywide steps the law now allows. <strong>Lower the default speed to 20 mph</strong>. The city has the authority. Fewer people die when drivers go 20 instead of 30. Pair that with <strong>speed‑limiters for repeat offenders</strong> so the worst drivers cannot outrun the law.</p><p>This district has eleven dead. Their families live with the numbers. The fixes are known. Make the calls. Do it now.</p><p>Want to push for the changes that save lives?

The measure, sponsored by Senator Jamaal Bailey, excludes violations in cooperative housing developments with at least 10,000 Mitchell-Lama units from bus operation traffic regulations. The bill advanced through committee and received broad support in both chambers. By exempting these large complexes, the law weakens traffic enforcement where thousands live. This move increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, stripping away protections that save lives. Vulnerable road users lose another layer of safety in dense city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact sent the SUV into a southbound NYPD cruiser. The article notes, 'An SUV slammed into an NYPD cruiser in a three-car smash-up in Brooklyn early Sunday.' Two police officers and two SUV passengers were hospitalized in stable condition. One person was taken into custody, though no charges were filed at the time of reporting. The crash, which occurred at 2:11 am, highlights the dangers at busy intersections and the violent force unleashed when vehicles collide.

A cyclist strikes. Bedford Avenue’s protected bike lane will vanish. City listens to complaints, not data. Streets stay dangerous. Cyclists and children caught in the crossfire. Policy shifts, safety left behind.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on June 14, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams will remove three blocks of the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn after several crashes, including one involving a child exiting a school bus. The mayor cited 'community concerns' and stated, 'After several incidents—including some involving children...we decided to adjust the current design.' City Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the move, calling it 'pure politics' and warning, 'He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists.' The article highlights tension between local complaints and street safety policy. No driver error is cited; the crash involved a cyclist and a child. The decision raises questions about how New York responds to vulnerable road users and whether removing infrastructure addresses underlying dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders must review rules yearly. No charge for time spent reading. City aims for clarity, not confusion.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1304-2025 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after introduction on June 11, 2025. The bill, titled "requiring micromobility share system operators to display rules of the road for safe operation," compels operators to show safety rules on apps and at stations. Users must review these rules at least once a year before unlocking a device. The bill bars operators from charging for this time. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hanif, Brewer, Restler, Louis, Narcisse, Lee, Marte, Hanks, Ariola, and Morano. The law aims to make safety rules visible and unavoidable for every rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
