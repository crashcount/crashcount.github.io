The toll is not just numbers. It is bodies broken, families left waiting for someone who will never come home. In the last twelve months alone, four people died and thirteen more were seriously hurt. Most were walking. Some were children. Some were old. All were vulnerable.</p><p><strong>Just this May, a 68-year-old woman was killed crossing Rutland Road.</strong> She had the signal. The driver turned left and crushed her. The cause: distraction. The outcome: final. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Last year, a 74-year-old woman was killed at Avenue D and New York Avenue. The driver failed to yield. She was crossing with the light. She did not make it across. These are not rare stories. They are the pattern.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> Since 2022, they killed six people and injured hundreds more. Motorcycles and mopeds have left their mark too. Bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction. The street is a battlefield, and the dead are almost always on foot or on two wheels.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for daylighting, truck route redesign, and legalizing jaywalking. She co-sponsored bills for more speed humps and safer crossings. But the pace is slow. The danger is faster.</p><p><strong>Some laws help.</strong> The Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from pedestrians. But other measures—like warning decals for taxis—are small steps. The big changes, like protected bike lanes and lower speed limits, are still waiting.</p><h3 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h3><p>After a recent crash, a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>described the scene</a>: <strong>&ldquo;He was laid out on the floor.

They just don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand real protection—protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that targets the real danger: reckless drivers.

The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more hiding the gaps.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1164-2023, now enacted, amends the city code to require an 'investment roadmap' in every Streets Master Plan starting December 1, 2026. The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passing on October 19, 2023, and became law on November 19, 2023. The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C. Riley (primary), with Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Hanif, Brewer, Restler, and Rivera as co-sponsors, the bill demands DOT report, by neighborhood, on safety infrastructure investment, crash rates, and demographics. It shines a light on which districts get safety upgrades and which are left exposed. The roadmap aims to close the gap for underserved areas, forcing transparency and accountability for every dollar spent on street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more big rigs clogging residential blocks. By 2025, each borough must have a site. The city must act or explain delays. Streets may breathe. Danger shifts from curbs.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0906-2023, now Local Law 142 of 2023, was enacted by the City Council on October 29, 2023, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill’s title: 'A Local Law in relation to parking for tractor trailers and other commercial trucks.' It requires the city to identify at least one feasible off-street parking location for tractor trailers in each borough by the end of 2023, and to establish those sites by December 31, 2025. No location can be on a residential street. Council Member Kamillah Hanks sponsored the bill, joined by Brannan, Riley, Dinowitz, Ung, Brooks-Powers, and others. The law aims to clear residential streets of oversized trucks, shifting their presence to designated lots. The council’s action targets the chronic hazard of trucks parked where people walk, bike, and live.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure urges the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.1679/S.561, which would 'increase the penalty for leaving the scene of an accident involving an e-scooter and further calls upon the New York State Legislature to include e-bikes in such legislation.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Gale A. Brewer, Shaun Abreu, Lynn C. Schulman, and Amanda Farías backed the resolution. The bill would raise penalties for e-scooter hit-and-runs from a violation to a misdemeanor or felony, and seeks to add e-bikes to the law.
