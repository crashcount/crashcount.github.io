The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just this May, a woman crossing with the signal at East 95th Street and Rutland Road was struck and killed by a turning sedan. She was 68. The driver was distracted. She died in the crosswalk, doing everything right, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In April last year, a 74-year-old woman was killed at Avenue D and New York Avenue.

Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—four deaths and hundreds of wounds. Trucks and buses took two more lives. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own trail of pain.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the past year, <strong>81 kids were hurt</strong>. Some were walking. Some were riding.

Louis has backed bills for safer streets. She voted to remove abandoned vehicles and sponsored measures for bike share discounts for seniors and students. She also co-sponsored a bill to force e-bike share operators to display safety rules. But she is pushing a bill to cap e-bike speeds at 15 mph—a move that shifts the burden to cyclists, not drivers. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>See the record</a>.</p><p>State Senator Kevin Parker voted yes on the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong>, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He also voted to extend school speed zones. But in the past, he has faced calls to do more for street safety.

A Dodge SUV struck a 25-year-old man riding a ZHI motorcycle from behind, ejecting him and causing severe crush injuries to his entire body. The police report states the SUV's driver was inattentive or distracted, listing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The motorcyclist was left unconscious at the scene, his motorcycle demolished. The report further notes 'Alcohol Involvement' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors in the crash. The SUV's front end collided with the motorcycle's rear, a classic pattern of driver error and systemic danger for vulnerable road users. The police report records that the motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail appears only after the driver’s documented failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

A bus traveling south was merging when it collided with a sedan making a right turn. The point of impact was the sedan's right rear bumper and the bus's left front bumper. The sedan driver, a 34-year-old female occupant, was injured with chest trauma and experienced shock. She was restrained with a lap belt and harness and was not ejected. The report cites 'Pavement Slippery' as a contributing factor, indicating hazardous road conditions. No explicit driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding were listed, but the merging maneuver by the bus and the right turn by the sedan under slippery conditions created the collision. No victim behaviors were noted as contributing factors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
