Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last twelve months, the streets of Brooklyn CB17 have not let up. The dead include a 30-year-old man struck by a sedan on Church Avenue, a 68-year-old woman crossing with the signal on Rutland Road, and a 74-year-old woman killed at Avenue D and New York Avenue. Each was walking. Each was hit by a car. Each is gone.</p><p>The numbers are blunt. <strong>808 crashes so far this year. Four killed. Seven left with injuries so serious they may never recover.</strong> The pain is not spread evenly. Children, elders, people just trying to cross the street. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-usual-suspects>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Usual Suspects</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs were behind the wheel in over 550 cases. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds injured a handful. Bikes, five. The pattern is old. The outcome is not fate. It is design.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A woman, 68, crossing with the light. A sedan turns left. She is struck, killed. The cause: driver inattention. A 74-year-old, crossing with the signal. Another left turn. Another life ended. A 30-year-old man, hit by a speeding sedan. The crash report lists &ldquo;unsafe speed&rdquo;. The street does not forgive.</p><p>Neighbors see it. They know the danger. &ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said one</a>. The numbers back them up. In five years, one three-block stretch saw 59 crashes and 80 injuries. The city counts the dead. The living count the days until the next siren.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Council Member <a href=/council-district/45/>Farah N. Louis</a> has backed bills for more speed humps, raised crosswalks, and better lighting. She voted to redesign truck routes and daylight intersections. But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/58/>Monique Chandler-Waterman</a> missed a key vote to extend school speed zones. The streets wait. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not an act of God. It is a policy choice.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them: <strong>Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people walking and biking. Stop waiting.</strong></p><p>Every day they delay, someone else bleeds in the street.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

It passed committee and full council votes on August 15, 2024, and became law September 14, 2024, as Local Law 88 of 2024. Council Members Selvena N.
