Thirteen left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last twelve months, Brooklyn CB17 saw 1,358 crashes. Nearly a thousand hurt. The dead do not get second chances. The living carry scars.</p><p>On Rutland Road, a woman crossed with the light. A Mercedes turned left. She did not make it home. A witness <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>heard the van run over her and her bones crunching</a>. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same.</p><p>A school bus jumped the curb at Bedford and Farragut. The driver <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/woman-8-year-old-boy-struck-school-bus-flatbush-brooklyn/16148988/>hit the gas instead of the brakes, jumped the curb and struck the pedestrians before smashing into a fence</a>. The woman and the boy survived. The boy’s arm broke. The bus did not face charges. The curb is still there.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p><strong>Most of the blood comes from cars and trucks.</strong> Four killed by sedans. Two by trucks and buses. One by a van. One by an SUV. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are a rounding error in the carnage. The numbers are not abstract. They are names, families, empty chairs at dinner.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>say one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many</a>. They add crosswalks, lower some speed limits, build a few bike lanes. But the deaths keep coming. The left turns keep killing. The drivers keep walking away.</p><p><strong>No local law has stopped the bleeding.</strong> No leader in CB17 has stood on the corner where the blood dried and said, &ldquo;Never again.&rdquo; The silence is louder than the sirens.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where the most vulnerable come first.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, another family waits for the phone to ring. Don’t let it be yours.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
