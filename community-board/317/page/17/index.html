The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just this May, a woman crossing with the signal at East 95th Street and Rutland Road was struck and killed by a turning sedan. She was 68. The driver was distracted. She died in the crosswalk, doing everything right, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In April last year, a 74-year-old woman was killed at Avenue D and New York Avenue.

Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—four deaths and hundreds of wounds. Trucks and buses took two more lives. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own trail of pain.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the past year, <strong>81 kids were hurt</strong>. Some were walking. Some were riding.

Louis has backed bills for safer streets. She voted to remove abandoned vehicles and sponsored measures for bike share discounts for seniors and students. She also co-sponsored a bill to force e-bike share operators to display safety rules. But she is pushing a bill to cap e-bike speeds at 15 mph—a move that shifts the burden to cyclists, not drivers. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>See the record</a>.</p><p>State Senator Kevin Parker voted yes on the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong>, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He also voted to extend school speed zones. But in the past, he has faced calls to do more for street safety.
