Forty seriously hurt.</strong> In just the last twelve months, four lives ended and twelve more were left with wounds that do not heal. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children. They are the woman struck crossing with the signal at Avenue D and New York Avenue. She was 74. She had the light. The car turned left and took everything. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 68-year-old woman died on Rutland Road, crossing with the signal.

Most drivers keep driving.</strong></p><h3 id=the-blunt-edge-of-policy>The Blunt Edge of Policy</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Council Member Farah N. Louis has backed bills for senior and student bike share discounts and rules for micromobility safety. She also sponsored a bill to lower e-bike speeds to 15 mph. But slowing bikes will not stop cars from killing. The blood on the street is not from e-bikes. It is from sedans, SUVs, trucks. <strong>Cars and trucks caused the deaths of six people here.</strong></p><p>State Senator Kevin Parker voted yes to extend school speed zones and to require speed-limiting tech for repeat speeders. These are steps. But the streets remain dangerous. The city can set a 20 mph limit now. It has not. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A sister-in-law <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.
