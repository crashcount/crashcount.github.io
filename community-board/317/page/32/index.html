Four people have died in crashes here in the past year. Nine dead since 2022. More than 900 injured in just twelve months. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, elders. They are the man who never made it home, the woman left bleeding in the crosswalk, the child who will not ride a bike again.</p><p>On May 14, a 68-year-old woman was crossing Rutland Road with the signal. A sedan turned left. She was crushed and killed. The cause: driver inattention. The record shows her death as a statistic, but a life ended in the middle of the day, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On January 25, a 30-year-old man was killed at Church Avenue and Kings Highway. The car was speeding. He was crossing. He died. The city keeps counting.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The horror is not quiet. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said an eyewitness</a> after a 90-year-old man was struck by a hit-and-run moped rider. The driver wore a mask. He hit the man and left. The old man died in the hospital. The street stayed the same.</p><p>A grandson spoke for the family: &ldquo;We hope the authorities can find the person who did this. We are also concerned about the motorcycles running rampant in crowded residential areas,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>reported CBS New York</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for bills to daylight intersections, redesign truck routes, and legalize jaywalking. She has co-sponsored laws for more speed humps, better lighting, and protected bike lanes. These are steps, but the blood on the street says it is not enough. Crashes keep coming. The dead keep piling up.</p><p>The city can lower speed limits. It can build real protection for people walking and biking. It can end the reign of repeat dangerous drivers. But every day of delay means another family broken.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot speak. The living must not wait.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution calls on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to remediate any transportation structure, primarily elevated train lines, with extremely high levels of lead. Council Member Sandy Nurse led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Cabán, Hanif, Abreu, Louis, Holden, Gutiérrez, Joseph, Won, Brewer, and Lee. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The resolution cites studies showing lead levels in paint chips from elevated tracks far above legal limits. The council demands action to protect New Yorkers from toxic exposure. The MTA, a state-run agency, holds the power to act.

He targets abuse by city officials and fake permits. His bill exempts people with disabilities. Another measure rewards whistleblowers. The Council should pass both. The city’s streets demand it.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2022, Councilman Lincoln Restler (District 33) announced legislation to revoke tens of thousands of personal vehicle parking placards, with exemptions for people with disabilities and those covered by collective bargaining. The editorial, titled 'Free perking: Pull back run amok NYC parking placards,' calls out rampant placard abuse: 'End this scam.' Restler’s companion bill would reward whistleblowers who report cheaters with 25% of fines collected. Both measures have four co-sponsors. The editorial urges the Council to pass the bills and for Mayor Adams to sign them. Placard abuse fuels lawless parking, endangering pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s lack of oversight lets drivers block crosswalks and bike lanes. Restler’s push aims to restore fairness and safety to New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.
