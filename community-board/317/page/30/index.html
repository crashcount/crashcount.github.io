A 74-year-old woman, walking with the light at Avenue D and New York Avenue, struck down by a driver who failed to yield. A 47-year-old man, crushed by a truck on Linden Boulevard.

The primary sponsor was Kristin Richardson Jordan, joined by Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Julie Won, Rita C. Joseph, Crystal Hudson, Farah N. Louis, and Lincoln Restler. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. No safety analyst assessed its impact on vulnerable road users.
