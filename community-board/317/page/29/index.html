The toll is not just numbers. It is bodies broken, families left waiting for someone who will never come home. In the last twelve months alone, four people died and thirteen more were seriously hurt. Most were walking. Some were children. Some were old. All were vulnerable.</p><p><strong>Just this May, a 68-year-old woman was killed crossing Rutland Road.</strong> She had the signal. The driver turned left and crushed her. The cause: distraction. The outcome: final. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Last year, a 74-year-old woman was killed at Avenue D and New York Avenue. The driver failed to yield. She was crossing with the light. She did not make it across. These are not rare stories. They are the pattern.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> Since 2022, they killed six people and injured hundreds more. Motorcycles and mopeds have left their mark too. Bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction. The street is a battlefield, and the dead are almost always on foot or on two wheels.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for daylighting, truck route redesign, and legalizing jaywalking. She co-sponsored bills for more speed humps and safer crossings. But the pace is slow. The danger is faster.</p><p><strong>Some laws help.</strong> The Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from pedestrians. But other measures—like warning decals for taxis—are small steps. The big changes, like protected bike lanes and lower speed limits, are still waiting.</p><h3 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h3><p>After a recent crash, a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>described the scene</a>: <strong>&ldquo;He was laid out on the floor.

They just don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand real protection—protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that targets the real danger: reckless drivers.

It also mandated a Department of Transportation guide for collision victims, outlining rights to police reports and insurance information. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to resources for victims of motor vehicle collisions.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Mercedes Narcisse, and Lincoln Restler backed the bill. The bill was filed at session's end on December 31, 2023, without passage.

Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The bill aimed to require every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter, and other legal motorized vehicle to be registered with the Department of Transportation and display a visible license plate. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered.' Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections. The streets stayed dangerous. The cars kept their edge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
