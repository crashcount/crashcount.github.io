Nearly a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year alone, Brooklyn CB17 has seen 1,345 crashes. Thirteen left people with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs and silent phones.</p><p>Maurette Lafleur, 68, was crossing Rutland Road with the light. A Mercedes turned left and struck her. She died in the crosswalk. The driver stayed. No charges. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/woman-68-fatally-struck-by-mercedes-driver-in-brooklyn-crosswalk/>described</a> the horror: &ldquo;I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching.&rdquo; The city moved on.</p><p>A pregnant woman was killed in a hit-and-run.

They point to <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>new intersection designs</a> and say, &ldquo;Redesigning our streets under Vision Zero has helped us reduce traffic deaths to historic lows but we are always looking for new ways to keep people safe.&rdquo; But the dead keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders face expiration. The law to keep them running is stalled.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Every injury is a warning. Every death is a failure to act.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand permanent speed cameras. Demand streets where the most vulnerable come first.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.

The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It requires the city to identify at least one feasible off-street parking location for tractor trailers in each borough by the end of 2023, and to establish those sites by December 31, 2025. No location can be on a residential street. Council Member Kamillah Hanks sponsored the bill, joined by Brannan, Riley, Dinowitz, Ung, Brooks-Powers, and others. The law aims to clear residential streets of oversized trucks, shifting their presence to designated lots.
