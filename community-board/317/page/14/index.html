The toll is not just numbers. It is bodies broken, families left waiting for someone who will never come home. In the last twelve months alone, four people died and thirteen more were seriously hurt. Most were walking. Some were children. Some were old. All were vulnerable.</p><p><strong>Just this May, a 68-year-old woman was killed crossing Rutland Road.</strong> She had the signal. The driver turned left and crushed her. The cause: distraction. The outcome: final. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Last year, a 74-year-old woman was killed at Avenue D and New York Avenue. The driver failed to yield. She was crossing with the light. She did not make it across. These are not rare stories. They are the pattern.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> Since 2022, they killed six people and injured hundreds more. Motorcycles and mopeds have left their mark too. Bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction. The street is a battlefield, and the dead are almost always on foot or on two wheels.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for daylighting, truck route redesign, and legalizing jaywalking. She co-sponsored bills for more speed humps and safer crossings. But the pace is slow. The danger is faster.</p><p><strong>Some laws help.</strong> The Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from pedestrians. But other measures—like warning decals for taxis—are small steps. The big changes, like protected bike lanes and lower speed limits, are still waiting.</p><h3 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h3><p>After a recent crash, a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>described the scene</a>: <strong>&ldquo;He was laid out on the floor.

They just don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand real protection—protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that targets the real danger: reckless drivers.

According to the police report, the crash involved a 2023 Mitsubishi SUV traveling east and a 2016 Toyota SUV traveling west. Both vehicles sustained center front end damage. The driver of the Toyota, a 34-year-old man, was injured with shoulder and upper arm contusions but remained conscious and restrained by a lap belt and harness. The front passenger, a 31-year-old man, suffered knee and lower leg injuries and was in shock. The report cites 'Failure to Keep Right' as a contributing factor and notes that the passenger fell asleep, which may have impaired the driver's control.
