Nearly a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year alone, Brooklyn CB17 has seen 1,345 crashes. Thirteen left people with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs and silent phones.</p><p>Maurette Lafleur, 68, was crossing Rutland Road with the light. A Mercedes turned left and struck her. She died in the crosswalk. The driver stayed. No charges. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/woman-68-fatally-struck-by-mercedes-driver-in-brooklyn-crosswalk/>described</a> the horror: &ldquo;I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching.&rdquo; The city moved on.</p><p>A pregnant woman was killed in a hit-and-run.

They point to <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>new intersection designs</a> and say, &ldquo;Redesigning our streets under Vision Zero has helped us reduce traffic deaths to historic lows but we are always looking for new ways to keep people safe.&rdquo; But the dead keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders face expiration. The law to keep them running is stalled.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Every injury is a warning. Every death is a failure to act.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand permanent speed cameras. Demand streets where the most vulnerable come first.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.

It passed committee and full council votes on August 15, 2024, and became law September 14, 2024, as Local Law 88 of 2024. Council Members Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, Lynn C. Schulman, Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, and others backed the measure. The law compels DOT to publish monthly and annual data on bike and micromobility use, including counts from automated sensors. DOT must also describe safety projects and analyze crash and usage data to guide improvements. This law forces transparency.
