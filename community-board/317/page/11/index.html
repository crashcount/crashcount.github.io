Forty seriously hurt.</strong> In just the last twelve months, four lives ended and twelve more were left with wounds that do not heal. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children. They are the woman struck crossing with the signal at Avenue D and New York Avenue. She was 74. She had the light. The car turned left and took everything. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 68-year-old woman died on Rutland Road, crossing with the signal.

Most drivers keep driving.</strong></p><h3 id=the-blunt-edge-of-policy>The Blunt Edge of Policy</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough. Council Member Farah N. Louis has backed bills for senior and student bike share discounts and rules for micromobility safety. She also sponsored a bill to lower e-bike speeds to 15 mph. But slowing bikes will not stop cars from killing. The blood on the street is not from e-bikes. It is from sedans, SUVs, trucks. <strong>Cars and trucks caused the deaths of six people here.</strong></p><p>State Senator Kevin Parker voted yes to extend school speed zones and to require speed-limiting tech for repeat speeders. These are steps. But the streets remain dangerous. The city can set a 20 mph limit now. It has not. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A sister-in-law <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

A Dodge SUV struck a 25-year-old man riding a ZHI motorcycle from behind, ejecting him and causing severe crush injuries to his entire body. The police report states the SUV's driver was inattentive or distracted, listing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The motorcyclist was left unconscious at the scene, his motorcycle demolished. The report further notes 'Alcohol Involvement' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors in the crash. The SUV's front end collided with the motorcycle's rear, a classic pattern of driver error and systemic danger for vulnerable road users. The police report records that the motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail appears only after the driver’s documented failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The dump truck driver, a 25-year-old male occupant wearing a lap belt, sustained back injuries and whiplash, and was reported to be in shock. The report cites 'Other Vehicular' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors to the crash. No pedestrian or cyclist was involved. The bus, a 2006 International truck/bus, suffered damage to its center front end. This incident highlights driver inattention and the dangers posed by turning vehicles near parked trucks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The law’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to tracking progress made towards the requirements of the streets master plan.' It forces transparency on protected bike lanes, bus lanes, pedestrian signals, and upgrades. The public will see delays, costs, and status. No more secrets.
