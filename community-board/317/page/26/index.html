Four people have died in crashes here in the past year. Nine dead since 2022. More than 900 injured in just twelve months. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, elders. They are the man who never made it home, the woman left bleeding in the crosswalk, the child who will not ride a bike again.</p><p>On May 14, a 68-year-old woman was crossing Rutland Road with the signal. A sedan turned left. She was crushed and killed. The cause: driver inattention. The record shows her death as a statistic, but a life ended in the middle of the day, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On January 25, a 30-year-old man was killed at Church Avenue and Kings Highway. The car was speeding. He was crossing. He died. The city keeps counting.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The horror is not quiet. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said an eyewitness</a> after a 90-year-old man was struck by a hit-and-run moped rider. The driver wore a mask. He hit the man and left. The old man died in the hospital. The street stayed the same.</p><p>A grandson spoke for the family: &ldquo;We hope the authorities can find the person who did this. We are also concerned about the motorcycles running rampant in crowded residential areas,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>reported CBS New York</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for bills to daylight intersections, redesign truck routes, and legalize jaywalking. She has co-sponsored laws for more speed humps, better lighting, and protected bike lanes. These are steps, but the blood on the street says it is not enough. Crashes keep coming. The dead keep piling up.</p><p>The city can lower speed limits. It can build real protection for people walking and biking. It can end the reign of repeat dangerous drivers. But every day of delay means another family broken.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot speak. The living must not wait.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, introduced January 19, 2023, was sponsored by Council Member Farah N. Louis (primary), with Holden, Stevens, Restler, Farías, Richardson Jordan, and Schulman as co-sponsors. The resolution’s title reads: 'calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to allow seniors and people with disabilities to receive fare discounts on express buses during rush hours.' The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The move sought to make transit more accessible for vulnerable New Yorkers, who face rising fares and shrinking service.
