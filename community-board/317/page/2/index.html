Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last twelve months, the streets of Brooklyn CB17 have not let up. The dead include a 30-year-old man struck by a sedan on Church Avenue, a 68-year-old woman crossing with the signal on Rutland Road, and a 74-year-old woman killed at Avenue D and New York Avenue. Each was walking. Each was hit by a car. Each is gone.</p><p>The numbers are blunt. <strong>808 crashes so far this year. Four killed. Seven left with injuries so serious they may never recover.</strong> The pain is not spread evenly. Children, elders, people just trying to cross the street. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-usual-suspects>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Usual Suspects</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs were behind the wheel in over 550 cases. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds injured a handful. Bikes, five. The pattern is old. The outcome is not fate. It is design.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A woman, 68, crossing with the light. A sedan turns left. She is struck, killed. The cause: driver inattention. A 74-year-old, crossing with the signal. Another left turn. Another life ended. A 30-year-old man, hit by a speeding sedan. The crash report lists &ldquo;unsafe speed&rdquo;. The street does not forgive.</p><p>Neighbors see it. They know the danger. &ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said one</a>. The numbers back them up. In five years, one three-block stretch saw 59 crashes and 80 injuries. The city counts the dead. The living count the days until the next siren.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Council Member <a href=/council-district/45/>Farah N. Louis</a> has backed bills for more speed humps, raised crosswalks, and better lighting. She voted to redesign truck routes and daylight intersections. But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/58/>Monique Chandler-Waterman</a> missed a key vote to extend school speed zones. The streets wait. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not an act of God. It is a policy choice.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them: <strong>Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people walking and biking. Stop waiting.</strong></p><p>Every day they delay, someone else bleeds in the street.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

One cyclist, Robert Hillebrand, suffered a severed windpipe and required blood transfusions. Another, Jennifer Noble, received stitches and a broken finger. Police said the string was likely from kite fighting, a practice where glass-coated strings are used to cut opponents' kites. Witnesses described a yellow nylon string stretched across the bike lane. The NYPD found no criminality. The city parks department bans kite fighting but enforcement is lacking. Danny Mundy, a local civic leader, said, “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable.” Previous injuries and lawsuits linked to kite string in the area highlight ongoing risks for cyclists and wildlife.

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a discounted bike share rate for public school students aged 16 or older,” would require the Department of Transportation to set a discounted rate for eligible students. Council Member Christopher Marte leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gale A. Brewer, Shahana K. Hanif, Sandy Nurse, Linda Lee, Keith Powers, Lincoln Restler, Chi A. Ossé, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Althea V. Stevens, and Farah N. Louis. The measure aims to make cycling more accessible for youth, but the city must ensure safe streets as more young riders join traffic. The bill remains under committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
