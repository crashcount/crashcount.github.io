Since 2022, eleven people are dead here. Seven were walking. One was biking. Two were riding small motors. One was in a car. In the same span, 3,700-plus were hurt. These are the city’s own numbers.</p><p><strong>Nights take more.</strong> From 7 p.m. to midnight, deaths pile up, with peaks at 7, 9, 10 and 11 p.m. The hour of 7 p.m. has three deaths. Nine p.m. has one. Ten p.m. has one. Eleven p.m. has one. Injuries swell through the late afternoon and evening, then keep coming after dark. That is the pattern.</p><h3 id=linden-and-church-names-you-dont-forget>Linden and Church: names you don’t forget</h3><p>Linden Boulevard cuts long and wide. It leads the harm count here: one death, 129 injuries. Church Avenue shows two deaths and 165 injuries. Utica Avenue adds 82 injured. Tilden Avenue holds fewer injuries but five serious ones. These corridors are not rumors; they are on the city’s map.</p><p>At Church and East 95th, a 68‑year‑old woman crossed with the signal. A left‑turning sedan hit her. She died there. The record lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” At Church and Kings Highway, a man crossing against the light was struck by a sedan at unsafe speed. He died. The light changed. He did not.</p><h3 id=riders-thrown-bodies-broken>Riders thrown, bodies broken</h3><p>On Linden at Church, a bus and an e‑scooter met. The e‑scooter rider, 44, was ejected. He was listed as unlicensed. He died. On Clarendon Road near East 35th, a moped rider, 34, was ejected in a crash with an SUV. He died of crush injuries. On Church at East 55th, an SUV hit a pedestrian in the crosswalk. He died. The file notes “Alcohol Involvement.” The street does not explain. It only records.</p><h3 id=what-the-clock-says>What the clock says</h3><p>Harm swells after school and work. Injuries climb from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m., then the deaths come on. The numbers at 7 p.m. are worst: three killed, 203 injured. Nine p.m. to 11 p.m. holds more dead and the kind of injuries that change a life. The file shows it hour by hour.</p><h3 id=what-hits-you-here>What hits you here</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the striking. Sedans alone account for four pedestrian deaths and 247 pedestrian injuries. SUVs add one death and 191 injuries. Trucks and buses together add two pedestrian deaths. People outside vehicles pay the price: seven pedestrians dead, one cyclist dead, one rider on a moped/e‑scooter dead. That is how the tally breaks.</p><p>The listed causes read plain: “other” dominates injury counts. Then “vulnerable road user error.” Then inattention. Failure to yield. Unsafe speed appears in the deadly files. Each entry is a line on a coroner’s ledger.</p><h3 id=promises-and-votes>Promises and votes</h3><p>At City Hall, Council Member Farah N. Louis put her name on a bill to force the city to install school‑zone traffic devices within 60 days of a determination. She also co‑sponsored a crackdown on unlicensed commuter vans. These are moves on the edges but they are on the record.</p><p>In Albany, State Sen. Kevin Parker voted yes in committee for the Stop Super Speeders bill that would force repeat violators to install speed‑limiting tech. It passed committee. The bill targets drivers with patterns of tickets and points. It is meant for the 1.5 percent who do a lot of the killing.</p><h3 id=what-will-stop-the-bleeding>What will stop the bleeding</h3><p>Start where the bodies fall: Linden Boulevard, Church Avenue, Utica Avenue, Tilden Avenue. Daylight every corner. Give pedestrians a head start at signals. Harden left turns. Narrow lanes. Add refuge where people cross long runs. Work the late‑day and night hours with targeted enforcement at these exact blocks.</p><p>Then take the citywide steps the law now allows. <strong>Lower the default speed to 20 mph</strong>. The city has the authority. Fewer people die when drivers go 20 instead of 30. Pair that with <strong>speed‑limiters for repeat offenders</strong> so the worst drivers cannot outrun the law.</p><p>This district has eleven dead. Their families live with the numbers. The fixes are known. Make the calls. Do it now.</p><p>Want to push for the changes that save lives?
