Four people have died in crashes here in the past year. Nine dead since 2022. More than 900 injured in just twelve months. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, elders. They are the man who never made it home, the woman left bleeding in the crosswalk, the child who will not ride a bike again.</p><p>On May 14, a 68-year-old woman was crossing Rutland Road with the signal. A sedan turned left. She was crushed and killed. The cause: driver inattention. The record shows her death as a statistic, but a life ended in the middle of the day, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On January 25, a 30-year-old man was killed at Church Avenue and Kings Highway. The car was speeding. He was crossing. He died. The city keeps counting.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The horror is not quiet. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said an eyewitness</a> after a 90-year-old man was struck by a hit-and-run moped rider. The driver wore a mask. He hit the man and left. The old man died in the hospital. The street stayed the same.</p><p>A grandson spoke for the family: &ldquo;We hope the authorities can find the person who did this. We are also concerned about the motorcycles running rampant in crowded residential areas,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>reported CBS New York</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member Farah N. Louis has voted for bills to daylight intersections, redesign truck routes, and legalize jaywalking. She has co-sponsored laws for more speed humps, better lighting, and protected bike lanes. These are steps, but the blood on the street says it is not enough. Crashes keep coming. The dead keep piling up.</p><p>The city can lower speed limits. It can build real protection for people walking and biking. It can end the reign of repeat dangerous drivers. But every day of delay means another family broken.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot speak. The living must not wait.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Louis, Kalman Yeger, Sandy Nurse, Shahana K. Hanif, and Althea V. Stevens. The bill mandated a four-week comment window and a two-week response period, plus annual reporting and advance notice for temporary changes.

New York lags behind other states on older driver safety rules.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0090-2022, filed at session’s end, came from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced March 24, 2022, it urges Albany to pass S.5004. The resolution’s title: 'calling upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.5004, to enhance the fitness and safety requirements for certain licensed individuals.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor, District 44) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) led the push. The bill responds to the death of Madeline Sershen, 17, killed by an 88-year-old driver who ran a red. S.5004 would require drivers to prove medical fitness with a physician’s exam after their seventh license renewal. New York’s current rules only demand a vision test every eight years, far less strict than many states. The council’s action highlights a gap in protections for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders dodge chaos.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0045-2022 was introduced on February 24, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, sponsored by David M. Carr (primary), with Farah N. Louis and Joseph C. Borelli as co-sponsors, sought to require the Department of Transportation to group new active transportation docking stations—bike, scooter, and e-mobility docks—within one city block of each other, unless contracts prevented it. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring centralized siting of active transportation docking stations.' The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. Without passage, the city’s docking stations remain scattered, leaving vulnerable road users to navigate a patchwork of locations and unpredictable street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
