Since 2022, <strong>nine people have died</strong> in Brooklyn CB17. <strong>Forty more have been seriously injured</strong>. The numbers do not show the faces, but the pain is real. In the last twelve months alone, four people died. A woman, 68, was crushed crossing with the signal at Rutland Road and E 95th. A 74-year-old woman was killed on Avenue D. A man, 30, died on Church Avenue. The dead do not get second chances.</p><p><strong>Most victims are on foot or bike.</strong> Cars and SUVs did the most harm—over 500 crashes, four deaths, and seven serious injuries to pedestrians. Trucks killed two more. Motorcycles and mopeds left bodies broken. The street is a gauntlet for the old, the young, and everyone in between.</p><h3 id=the-voices-aftermath-and-anger>The Voices: Aftermath and Anger</h3><p>After the crash, the street is quiet. But the words remain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>. The grief does not fade. Another voice cuts through: &ldquo;I have no idea why he was doing donuts in the parking lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Griselda Caraballo</a>, after a driver killed a young woman in a parking lot stunt. The tire marks lingered for days.</p><h3 id=the-response-what-leaders-doand-dont>The Response: What Leaders Do—and Don’t</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have acted, but not enough.</strong> Council Member Farah Louis sponsored bills for safer bike share and senior discounts, but also a bill to cap e-bike speeds at 15 mph—a move that shifts blame to riders, not drivers. State Senator Kevin Parker voted yes to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. But the carnage continues. <strong>Every delay is another risk.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Contact your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers, not just cyclists. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand up before another family gets the call. The street will not change itself. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The car kept moving, danger unchecked.</p><p class=mb3>Two men riding an e-scooter on East 38th Street near Avenue D in Brooklyn were struck by a Lexus sedan, according to the police report. The crash occurred at 19:47, with both victims—aged 23 and 26—suffering severe lacerations and partial ejection from the scooter. The report states, 'A Lexus struck an e-scooter carrying two men. No helmets. Both thrown, torn, bleeding. Steel met flesh. Skin split open.' Both men were conscious but badly injured, left broken across the road. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The sedan driver, licensed in New York, was traveling straight ahead at the time of impact. The report also notes 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary failure remains with the distracted driver. The collision underscores the lethal consequences when drivers lose focus behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
