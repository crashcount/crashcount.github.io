Nearly a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year alone, Brooklyn CB17 has seen 1,345 crashes. Thirteen left people with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs and silent phones.</p><p>Maurette Lafleur, 68, was crossing Rutland Road with the light. A Mercedes turned left and struck her. She died in the crosswalk. The driver stayed. No charges. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/woman-68-fatally-struck-by-mercedes-driver-in-brooklyn-crosswalk/>described</a> the horror: &ldquo;I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching.&rdquo; The city moved on.</p><p>A pregnant woman was killed in a hit-and-run. Her family grieves. The driver fled. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-was-pregnant-family-says/>&ldquo;A woman killed in a hit-and-run in Brooklyn on Saturday night was pregnant, her family says.&rdquo;</a> No one has been charged.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-most-vulnerable>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Most Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed four. Trucks and vans killed two.</strong> In total, eight people have died since 2022. More than 3,200 have been injured. Most were walking. Some were cycling. Many were children or seniors. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h2><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They point to <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>new intersection designs</a> and say, &ldquo;Redesigning our streets under Vision Zero has helped us reduce traffic deaths to historic lows but we are always looking for new ways to keep people safe.&rdquo; But the dead keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders face expiration. The law to keep them running is stalled.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Every injury is a warning. Every death is a failure to act.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand permanent speed cameras. Demand streets where the most vulnerable come first.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill was laid over by committee on February 10, 2025. The measure would take effect immediately if passed.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
