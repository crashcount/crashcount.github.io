Nearly a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year alone, Brooklyn CB17 has seen 1,345 crashes. Thirteen left people with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs and silent phones.</p><p>Maurette Lafleur, 68, was crossing Rutland Road with the light. A Mercedes turned left and struck her. She died in the crosswalk. The driver stayed. No charges. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/woman-68-fatally-struck-by-mercedes-driver-in-brooklyn-crosswalk/>described</a> the horror: &ldquo;I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching.&rdquo; The city moved on.</p><p>A pregnant woman was killed in a hit-and-run.

The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders face expiration. The law to keep them running is stalled.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Every injury is a warning. Every death is a failure to act.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand permanent speed cameras.

The vehicles were traveling mostly southbound, with one making a right turn and another making a left turn. The point of impact for all vehicles was the center front end, indicating a multi-vehicle chain collision. The report identifies unsafe speed as a contributing factor to the crash. One occupant, a 57-year-old male driver, was injured with contusions to the elbow and lower arm but was conscious and properly restrained with a lap belt and harness. The police report does not list any contributing factors related to the victim's behavior, focusing instead on the drivers' unsafe speed.

According to the police report, the crash involved a 2023 Mitsubishi SUV traveling east and a 2016 Toyota SUV traveling west. Both vehicles sustained center front end damage. The driver of the Toyota, a 34-year-old man, was injured with shoulder and upper arm contusions but remained conscious and restrained by a lap belt and harness. The front passenger, a 31-year-old man, suffered knee and lower leg injuries and was in shock. The report cites 'Failure to Keep Right' as a contributing factor and notes that the passenger fell asleep, which may have impaired the driver's control. The collision highlights driver errors and systemic risks on this stretch of road.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
