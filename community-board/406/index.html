The road stays dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (2025-06-18) reports that Gilbert Augustin received a 10-year sentence for a deadly road rage attack in Queens. After a crash on the Van Wyck Expressway, Augustin assaulted Jasmer Singh, using slurs and violence. Prosecutors said Augustin yelled, 'No police, no police,' and called Singh 'turban man' before punching him. Singh died from the assault. Police were initially slow to pursue hate crime charges, but a grand jury and community pressure led to a harsher indictment. Augustin pleaded guilty to second-degree assault as a hate crime, avoiding a possible manslaughter conviction. The case highlights gaps in hate crime enforcement and the lethal risk of post-crash confrontations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Access grows.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on June 5, 2025, that New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) reached a milestone: 50% of active taxis are now wheelchair accessible. TLC Commissioner David Do said, “We made that today. It is the most accessible fleet in the entire country.” This achievement follows a decade-long push by disability advocates and a 2013 settlement requiring half the medallion fleet to be accessible. The transition faced delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic and medallion owner financial struggles. Policy changes, such as alternating accessible vehicles and funding support, drove the shift. The article highlights systemic progress, not individual driver actions, and underscores the impact of sustained advocacy and regulatory pressure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight for vulnerable lives pressed on, urgent and raw.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2025, victims of road violence and Families for Safe Streets lobbied at the State Capitol for the SAFE Streets Package. This package includes the 'Idaho stop' bill and the 'Stop Super-Speeders' bill. The event saw support from several Assembly members and a senator for speed controls, while Sen. Anthony Palumbo and Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposed the super speeder bill, citing government overreach. Sen. Leroy Comrie opposed the Idaho stop bill, citing concerns for seniors. Separately, Senate bill S533, which aimed to block congestion pricing, was defeated in the Senate Transportation Committee. Chair Jeremy Cooney stressed, 'You have to have a plan. If you don’t have a plan, what are [you] doing to get the $15 billion revenue?' The day highlighted the rift between safety demands and political resistance, with victims' voices at the center.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cars remain deadly for those outside them.</p><p class=mb3>On April 25, 2025, police charged Jorden Rosen, 42, with murder and criminal possession of a weapon after a road rage crash killed William McField, a 55-year-old motorcyclist, in Rego Park, Queens. The case, reported by Colin Mixson and Rocco Parascandola, centers on helmet cam footage showing Rosen's BMW rear-ending and running over McField after a minor collision on the Long Island Expressway. Queens DA Melinda Katz said, 'Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes.' Rosen surrendered at the 112th Precinct and was arraigned. No council members are involved; this is a criminal prosecution, not legislation. According to safety analysts, charging a driver with murder is an individual legal response, not a systemic policy change. It does not directly improve safety for pedestrians or cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
