The crash record lists “traffic control disregarded” and “driver inattention” among the factors. The entry is blunt: “Apparent Death.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> (CrashID 4799953).</li></ul><p>“Two motorists were badly hurt and still have not fully recovered,” the Queens DA said in another Queens case where a driver went the wrong way and smashed cars on the Clearview. “You want to fight?” the driver told a victim. He later said he entered the highway wrong-way “because I wanted to hurt people.” These words hang over every ramp and merge. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><p>Rush hours, then the dark</p><ul><li>Injury spikes run at 8 a.m., noon to 4 p.m., and again 6–8 p.m. Night is cruel too: deaths logged at midnight, 3–4 a.m., and 5 p.m. The late-night pattern is there in the hourly counts from the city feed <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>covering CB6</a>.</li><li>On the Long Island Expressway at 4:37 a.m. on May 27, 2023, a 22-year-old motorcyclist died in a collision involving a tractor-trailer.

The dataset shows 2 pedestrian deaths and 436 injuries tied to “other,” 44 injuries tied to vulnerable road user error, and smaller but sharp counts for signal disregard and failure to yield.

Simple fixes.</p><ul><li>Queens Boulevard at 63rd Drive. Daylighting and hardened lefts. Protect the bike lane at the conflict points.</li><li>Woodhaven Boulevard at 60th Drive. Slow turns with concrete, not paint. Give pedestrians a head start.</li><li>Long Island Expressway service roads. Close slip lanes where feasible. Mark crossings and add refuge islands where people already run it.</li></ul><p>These are standard tools. The need is recorded in the logs above. The places are named.</p><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>Albany renewed the city’s school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. Local lawmakers in this area voted yes. That keeps the cameras on. The next step is slower speeds everywhere.

Senators in Queens backed the Senate bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> in committee. An Assembly bill mirrors the idea and includes Assemblymember Andrew Hevesi as a co-sponsor <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A 7979</a>. These bills target the drivers who keep getting tickets and keep hurting people.</li></ul><p>Use the tools we have</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed. Keep cameras on. <strong>Mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders.</strong> These steps are on the table. Lawmakers linked to CB6 have already voted yes in committee on speed limiters. The crash map in this district shows why.

Sponsored by Queens Councilman Robert Holden, the bill sits in the health committee, chaired by Lynn Schulman. Speaker Adrienne Adams has not stated her position. The bill, described as a push to end the city’s carriage industry, gained attention after the death of a horse named Lady. Animal rights groups rallied, warning, 'Without a ban there will be more crashes in traffic, there will be more injuries and possibly deaths.' TWU Local 100 opposes the ban. Safety analysts note that removing carriages would cut unpredictable, slow vehicles from streets, reducing crash risk and making roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
