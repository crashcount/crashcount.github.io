It aims to 'establish a yellow alert system for law enforcement to publicize vehicle information in instances of hit-and-run accidents in which a person has been killed.' Comrie leads the charge. The alert would spread vehicle details after fatal hit-and-runs, aiming to help police track down drivers who flee. No safety analyst note is available. The bill targets the aftermath, not prevention.

Critics slam the deal as a handout to Vornado. Hundreds of homes and businesses face displacement. Promised funding for transit falls apart. The public gets risk. Developers get power.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2023, the debate over Gov. Hochul’s Penn Station redevelopment plan intensified. The $1.2-billion tax break, meant to spur ten new towers and fund a $20-billion transit overhaul, is under fire. The plan, pitched as a lifeline for Penn Station, now faces doubts about its ability to deliver. State officials admit the project will not fully fund the station. Developer Steve Roth, head of Vornado, is not required to build, putting revenue in doubt. Senator Leroy Comrie called for a reset, saying, “the GPP that’s been presented is not longer working.” Critics, including attorney Chuck Weinstock and policy analyst Rachael Fauss, argue the deal benefits Vornado, not the public. Hundreds of businesses and homes could be lost. The project’s value and feasibility remain in question. No safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
