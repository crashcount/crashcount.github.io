Pedestrians took 261 injuries and 2 deaths; cyclists 94 injuries and 1 death. Heavy vehicles hurt too: trucks and buses caused 15 pedestrian injuries, with 2 serious injuries. The harm clusters on <strong>Queens Boulevard</strong> and the <strong>Long Island Expressway</strong>. The numbers are drawn from the city’s own dataset <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>spanning 2022–2025</a>.</li><li>A 23-year-old cyclist was killed at Queens Boulevard and 63rd Drive during the evening rush on March 19, 2025. The crash record lists “traffic control disregarded” and “driver inattention” among the factors.

He later said he entered the highway wrong-way “because I wanted to hurt people.” These words hang over every ramp and merge. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><p>Rush hours, then the dark</p><ul><li>Injury spikes run at 8 a.m., noon to 4 p.m., and again 6–8 p.m. Night is cruel too: deaths logged at midnight, 3–4 a.m., and 5 p.m. The late-night pattern is there in the hourly counts from the city feed <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>covering CB6</a>.</li><li>On the Long Island Expressway at 4:37 a.m. on May 27, 2023, a 22-year-old motorcyclist died in a collision involving a tractor-trailer.

Senators in Queens backed the Senate bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> in committee. An Assembly bill mirrors the idea and includes Assemblymember Andrew Hevesi as a co-sponsor <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A 7979</a>. These bills target the drivers who keep getting tickets and keep hurting people.</li></ul><p>Use the tools we have</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed. Keep cameras on. <strong>Mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders.</strong> These steps are on the table. Lawmakers linked to CB6 have already voted yes in committee on speed limiters. The crash map in this district shows why.

The crash occurred at 18:55. The report states the cyclist 'struck the rear of a parked van. His face met steel. Blood ran down his cheek. He stayed upright, conscious, torn open.' The police list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. The van was stationary at the time, with no occupants. The cyclist suffered severe facial lacerations but remained conscious. The data does not cite any cyclist behavior as a contributing factor.

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On August 23, 2024, a group of New York State legislators—Assembly Members Phil Steck and Andrew Hevesi, State Senator Julia Salazar, and former Assembly Member Dick Gottfried—filed a legal brief against Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing. The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
