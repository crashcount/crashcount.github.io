The request, not yet a formal bill, follows a campaign by resident Pedro Rodriguez and support from Queens Community Board 6. Schulman wrote, the goal is for DOT 'to identify ways to improve traffic congestion, pedestrian experience, and mobility concerns along the corridor.' She cited input from local businesses and residents. Proposed changes include wider sidewalks, safer crossings, outdoor seating, and possibly pedestrianizing segments. From January 2018 to November 2022, 48 pedestrians and cyclists were injured in 356 crashes on Austin Street.

The committee urged the Department of Transportation to study sidewalk widening, safer crossings, outdoor seating, and even pedestrianizing segments of the street. The matter title reads: 'Austin Street in Forest Hills should be transformed into a pedestrian paradise instead of the car-choked, will-sapping roadway it is today.' Pedro Rodriguez, a local advocate, pressed for urgent action, citing ongoing injuries and business impacts. Council Member Lynn Schulman did not comment. DOT spokesperson Vin Barone welcomed the board's support for Vision Zero and promised further discussions. From January 2018 to November 2022, 356 crashes caused 80 injuries on this stretch—most to pedestrians and cyclists. The board’s push aims to end the violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Developers get power.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2023, the debate over Gov. Hochul’s Penn Station redevelopment plan intensified. The $1.2-billion tax break, meant to spur ten new towers and fund a $20-billion transit overhaul, is under fire. The plan, pitched as a lifeline for Penn Station, now faces doubts about its ability to deliver. State officials admit the project will not fully fund the station. Developer Steve Roth, head of Vornado, is not required to build, putting revenue in doubt. Senator Leroy Comrie called for a reset, saying, “the GPP that’s been presented is not longer working.” Critics, including attorney Chuck Weinstock and policy analyst Rachael Fauss, argue the deal benefits Vornado, not the public. Hundreds of businesses and homes could be lost. The project’s value and feasibility remain in question.
