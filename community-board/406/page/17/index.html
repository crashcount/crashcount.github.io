Pedestrians took 261 injuries and 2 deaths; cyclists 94 injuries and 1 death. Heavy vehicles hurt too: trucks and buses caused 15 pedestrian injuries, with 2 serious injuries. The harm clusters on <strong>Queens Boulevard</strong> and the <strong>Long Island Expressway</strong>. The numbers are drawn from the city’s own dataset <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>spanning 2022–2025</a>.</li><li>A 23-year-old cyclist was killed at Queens Boulevard and 63rd Drive during the evening rush on March 19, 2025. The crash record lists “traffic control disregarded” and “driver inattention” among the factors.

He later said he entered the highway wrong-way “because I wanted to hurt people.” These words hang over every ramp and merge. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><p>Rush hours, then the dark</p><ul><li>Injury spikes run at 8 a.m., noon to 4 p.m., and again 6–8 p.m. Night is cruel too: deaths logged at midnight, 3–4 a.m., and 5 p.m. The late-night pattern is there in the hourly counts from the city feed <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>covering CB6</a>.</li><li>On the Long Island Expressway at 4:37 a.m. on May 27, 2023, a 22-year-old motorcyclist died in a collision involving a tractor-trailer.

The dataset shows 2 pedestrian deaths and 436 injuries tied to “other,” 44 injuries tied to vulnerable road user error, and smaller but sharp counts for signal disregard and failure to yield.

Senators in Queens backed the Senate bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> in committee. An Assembly bill mirrors the idea and includes Assemblymember Andrew Hevesi as a co-sponsor <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A 7979</a>. These bills target the drivers who keep getting tickets and keep hurting people.</li></ul><p>Use the tools we have</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed. Keep cameras on. <strong>Mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders.</strong> These steps are on the table. Lawmakers linked to CB6 have already voted yes in committee on speed limiters. The crash map in this district shows why.

The $1.2-billion tax break, meant to spur ten new towers and fund a $20-billion transit overhaul, is under fire. The plan, pitched as a lifeline for Penn Station, now faces doubts about its ability to deliver. State officials admit the project will not fully fund the station. Developer Steve Roth, head of Vornado, is not required to build, putting revenue in doubt. Senator Leroy Comrie called for a reset, saying, “the GPP that’s been presented is not longer working.” Critics, including attorney Chuck Weinstock and policy analyst Rachael Fauss, argue the deal benefits Vornado, not the public. Hundreds of businesses and homes could be lost. The project’s value and feasibility remain in question.
