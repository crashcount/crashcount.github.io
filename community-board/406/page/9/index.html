The resolution urges Albany to act. It also pushes to include e-bikes. Lawmakers say stiffer penalties could keep more drivers at the scene. Vulnerable road users stand to gain.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0750-2023 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 14, 2023, and closed at session's end on December 31, 2023. The measure urges the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.1679/S.561, which would 'increase the penalty for leaving the scene of an accident involving an e-scooter and further calls upon the New York State Legislature to include e-bikes in such legislation.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Gale A. Brewer, Shaun Abreu, Lynn C. Schulman, and Amanda Farías backed the resolution. The bill would raise penalties for e-scooter hit-and-runs from a violation to a misdemeanor or felony, and seeks to add e-bikes to the law. The council argues this could keep more crash-involved riders at the scene, helping protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
