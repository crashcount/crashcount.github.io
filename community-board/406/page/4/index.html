Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage. Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes.
