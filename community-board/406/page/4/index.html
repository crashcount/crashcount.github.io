But they do not lie. <strong>Five people killed. Nine left with serious injuries. Over a thousand hurt.</strong> The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>A man on a motorcycle burns on Woodhaven Boulevard. The BMW that hit him keeps rolling. Flames eat the bike.

They lower speed limits in some places. But the blood keeps flowing. <strong>Local leaders have not done enough.</strong> No new laws. No bold votes. No public reckoning. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Every death is a failure. The families wait for action. The streets wait for change. The city has the power to lower speed limits. They have the power to build real protection. They have the power to enforce the law. They have the power to save lives. They must use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside the car. Demand action before another family gets the call.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The point of impact was the vehicle’s left rear quarter panel. The pedestrian sustained injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot, described as internal and rated injury severity 3, but remained conscious. The report explicitly cites the driver’s failure to yield right-of-way as the contributing factor to the crash. No damage was reported to the vehicle, and the driver was licensed and operating the SUV alone. The pedestrian’s crossing behavior was noted but not listed as a contributing factor.
