On Woodhaven Boulevard, Rosen struck McField from behind, ran him over, and continued driving, dragging the motorcycle until it caught fire. Rosen then hit another car before stopping at a lamp post. McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes."

Surveillance footage showed Pena’s Mercedes striking Diaz’s BMW at high speed, sending it skidding down the street. Diaz, 23, died. Pena admitted at the scene, 'I hit him. I ran the red light. And I'm a firefighter.' The FDNY cited conduct rules in his dismissal. The article highlights Pena’s failure to render aid and notes his attempt to invoke his firefighter status. The case raises questions about accountability for city employees and the dangers of impaired, reckless driving on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors said Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and struck Justin Diaz, 23, who had the right-of-way. Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly double the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The article states, 'Pena was driving nearly 60 mph above the speed limit after a night of drinking at a bar.' Surveillance footage confirmed the sequence. Two passengers in Pena's car were hospitalized.
