Introduced August 18, 2023, it 'requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during an eighteen month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' Assemblymember Emily Gallagher leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, and others. The bill aims to force chronic speeders to slow down. No safety analyst note is available, but the intent is clear: rein in repeat offenders, protect those outside the car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
