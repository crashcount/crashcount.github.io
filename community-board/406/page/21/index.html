Critics warn of secrecy and developer giveaways.</p><p class=mb3>On July 27, 2022, the state’s Public Authorities Control Board approved Governor Kathy Hochul’s Penn Station redevelopment plan. The project, described as a 'once-in-a-generation opportunity,' includes 18 million square feet of new office towers, 1,800 apartments, a $7 billion station upgrade, and promises of walkable streets and bike lanes. State Senator Leroy Comrie, representing District 14, voted for the initial PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) agreement but pledged not to support future deals without federal funding and approvals. The plan faces criticism from watchdogs and officials like State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli’s office, who called for a delay due to limited financial details. Reinvent Albany slammed the process for lacking transparency and questioned the reliance on developer tax breaks. The redevelopment’s impact on vulnerable road users remains unassessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Leroy Comrie drew a hard line. No exemptions for Manhattan’s congestion tolls. He stood firm as others called for carve-outs. His stance means every car pays. No relief for drivers. The city’s most vulnerable stay in the crosshairs.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2022, State Senator Leroy Comrie made a public statement on congestion pricing exemptions. The matter, covered by nypost.com, centers on calls from Mayor Eric Adams for more exemptions to the Manhattan congestion tolls. Adams argued, 'there should be a level of exemptions... so that we’re not overburdening New Yorkers.' But Comrie rejected this, stating, 'I don’t think there should be any exemptions, and I’m going to continue to say that there should be no exemptions.' The congestion pricing plan, passed in 2019, already exempts emergency vehicles, vehicles carrying disabled New Yorkers, and low-income residents inside the zone. Comrie’s stance keeps the system strict. No new carve-outs. The Traffic Mobility Review Board may still consider more, but Comrie’s position is clear: every driver pays the toll, no exceptions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
