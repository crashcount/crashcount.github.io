Pedestrians took 261 injuries and 2 deaths; cyclists 94 injuries and 1 death. Heavy vehicles hurt too: trucks and buses caused 15 pedestrian injuries, with 2 serious injuries. The harm clusters on <strong>Queens Boulevard</strong> and the <strong>Long Island Expressway</strong>. The numbers are drawn from the city’s own dataset <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>spanning 2022–2025</a>.</li><li>A 23-year-old cyclist was killed at Queens Boulevard and 63rd Drive during the evening rush on March 19, 2025. The crash record lists “traffic control disregarded” and “driver inattention” among the factors.

He later said he entered the highway wrong-way “because I wanted to hurt people.” These words hang over every ramp and merge. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><p>Rush hours, then the dark</p><ul><li>Injury spikes run at 8 a.m., noon to 4 p.m., and again 6–8 p.m. Night is cruel too: deaths logged at midnight, 3–4 a.m., and 5 p.m. The late-night pattern is there in the hourly counts from the city feed <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>covering CB6</a>.</li><li>On the Long Island Expressway at 4:37 a.m. on May 27, 2023, a 22-year-old motorcyclist died in a collision involving a tractor-trailer.

The dataset shows 2 pedestrian deaths and 436 injuries tied to “other,” 44 injuries tied to vulnerable road user error, and smaller but sharp counts for signal disregard and failure to yield.

Senators in Queens backed the Senate bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> in committee. An Assembly bill mirrors the idea and includes Assemblymember Andrew Hevesi as a co-sponsor <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A 7979</a>. These bills target the drivers who keep getting tickets and keep hurting people.</li></ul><p>Use the tools we have</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed. Keep cameras on. <strong>Mandate speed limiters for repeat offenders.</strong> These steps are on the table. Lawmakers linked to CB6 have already voted yes in committee on speed limiters. The crash map in this district shows why.

Critics warn of secrecy and developer giveaways.</p><p class=mb3>On July 27, 2022, the state’s Public Authorities Control Board approved Governor Kathy Hochul’s Penn Station redevelopment plan. The project, described as a 'once-in-a-generation opportunity,' includes 18 million square feet of new office towers, 1,800 apartments, a $7 billion station upgrade, and promises of walkable streets and bike lanes. State Senator Leroy Comrie, representing District 14, voted for the initial PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) agreement but pledged not to support future deals without federal funding and approvals. The plan faces criticism from watchdogs and officials like State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli’s office, who called for a delay due to limited financial details. Reinvent Albany slammed the process for lacking transparency and questioned the reliance on developer tax breaks. The redevelopment’s impact on vulnerable road users remains unassessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Leroy Comrie drew a hard line. No exemptions for Manhattan’s congestion tolls. He stood firm as others called for carve-outs. His stance means every car pays. No relief for drivers. The city’s most vulnerable stay in the crosshairs.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2022, State Senator Leroy Comrie made a public statement on congestion pricing exemptions. The matter, covered by nypost.com, centers on calls from Mayor Eric Adams for more exemptions to the Manhattan congestion tolls. Adams argued, 'there should be a level of exemptions... so that we’re not overburdening New Yorkers.' But Comrie rejected this, stating, 'I don’t think there should be any exemptions, and I’m going to continue to say that there should be no exemptions.' The congestion pricing plan, passed in 2019, already exempts emergency vehicles, vehicles carrying disabled New Yorkers, and low-income residents inside the zone. Comrie’s stance keeps the system strict. No new carve-outs. The Traffic Mobility Review Board may still consider more, but Comrie’s position is clear: every driver pays the toll, no exceptions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
