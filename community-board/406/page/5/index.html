Jean-Baptiste, driving a Dodge Ram, turned left and hit Jimenez as he crossed the busy intersection. Jimenez suffered a massive head injury and died a week later.

This package includes the 'Idaho stop' bill and the 'Stop Super-Speeders' bill. The event saw support from several Assembly members and a senator for speed controls, while Sen. Anthony Palumbo and Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposed the super speeder bill, citing government overreach. Sen. Leroy Comrie opposed the Idaho stop bill, citing concerns for seniors. Separately, Senate bill S533, which aimed to block congestion pricing, was defeated in the Senate Transportation Committee. Chair Jeremy Cooney stressed, 'You have to have a plan. If you don’t have a plan, what are [you] doing to get the $15 billion revenue?'

The case, reported by Colin Mixson and Rocco Parascandola, centers on helmet cam footage showing Rosen's BMW rear-ending and running over McField after a minor collision on the Long Island Expressway. Queens DA Melinda Katz said, 'Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes.' Rosen surrendered at the 112th Precinct and was arraigned. No council members are involved; this is a criminal prosecution, not legislation. According to safety analysts, charging a driver with murder is an individual legal response, not a systemic policy change. It does not directly improve safety for pedestrians or cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
