A cyclist hits her. She falls. Months later, it happens again. She is 72. Her kidney is torn. The police do not come. No report is filed. She is left to heal alone. <em>“Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene,”</em> she <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/she-was-hit-twice-by-bikes-in-central-park-and-says-nypd-never-followed-up-IH4810802>tells the press</a>.</p><p>In the last year, <strong>one person died and two suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. Forty more were hurt. In three years, two people have died, seven have been seriously injured, and 226 have been wounded in 404 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. A 43-year-old man on an e-bike died on the 97th Street Transverse. A 60-year-old pedestrian was killed by a garbage truck at Central Park North. A city worker, fixing a sign, was slashed by a cyclist after a near miss. <em>“It looked like the guy on the bicycle tried to apologize&mldr; And the guy was, like, Get the f&mdash; away from me! You just sliced me!”</em> a <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>witness said</a>.</p><p>Pedestrians, cyclists, children. They are the ones who fall. Cars, trucks, bikes, mopeds—they all draw blood. But the biggest wounds come from the biggest machines. Trucks and buses killed one, cars and SUVs hurt 21, bikes left ten pedestrians injured or worse.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Local leaders have moved. Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted to curb repeat speeders</a> with mandatory speed limiters. Assembly Member Micah Lasher voted to extend school speed zones. But the city still waits for a default 20 mph limit. Enforcement is scattershot. Reports are missing. The silence after a crash is as loud as the sirens that never come.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</strong></h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets where the old and young can walk without fear. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.

Mayor Eric Adams said, 'Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety.'

The policy, not a council bill but a mayoral action, follows months of warnings and public debate. Mayor Adams said, "Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety." The Department of Transportation cited overcrowding and safety risks on the Brooklyn Bridge, where daily pedestrian numbers have doubled since 2021. Vendors and advocates, including Mohamed Attia of the Street Vendor Project, condemned the ban for stripping workers—many disabled or veterans—of income with no safety net. Upper West Side Council Member Gale Brewer proposed a compromise bill to allow regulated vending on wider bridge sections, but the administration pushed ahead with a total ban. The city claims the measure will protect pedestrians, but offers no new space or support for displaced vendors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Community Board 7 voted against the plan, citing safety and congestion fears. Katina Ellison of the West 71st Street Block Association called the idea 'clearly terrible and dangerous.' CB 7’s Andrew Albert, also on the MTA board, supports charging stations but wants a different site. Ken Coughlin of CB 7 called the opposition hypocritical, noting the neighborhood’s reliance on delivery workers. Council Member Gale Brewer supports smaller, less invasive infrastructure. The Parks Department plans to proceed, but no timeline is set. Vulnerable road users—delivery workers—remain exposed, with no safe place to rest or recharge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, debated in committee, would permit vendors only on bridge walkways at least 16 feet wide and require 20 feet between each seller. Bridge approaches would remain off-limits. Brewer stated, 'I believe strongly that a full ban on vendors is not necessary,' and argued for clear, enforceable rules. The Department of Transportation had proposed a total ban on vending across all city-owned bridges, citing overcrowding. Brewer’s bill seeks a middle ground, allowing limited vending while addressing safety and crowding. Vendor advocates welcomed relief from a total ban but warned the spacing rule would be hard to enforce. The bill’s fate remains undecided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Upper West Side Panel Backs Resolution to Rein in Dangerous Mopeds,' supports Albany legislation requiring sellers to register mopeds with the DMV before sale. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores sponsor the bill. Bores said, 'We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets.'

The bill, not yet passed, would require every e-bike in New York City to be registered with the Department of Transportation. Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support. Opponents argue the registration bill could suppress e-bike use, increase police stops in communities of color, and worsen traffic violence. Holden dismissed these concerns, insisting his bill is vital for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan) introduced a bill in Albany to require moped dealers to register vehicles with the DMV before buyers leave the shop. The bill, supported by Assembly Member Alex Bores (D-Upper East Side), seeks to close a loophole that lets illegal mopeds flood city streets. The matter summary states: 'New legislation in Albany seeks to eliminate the use of illegal mopeds by requiring sellers to register them with the DMV before buyers can take them out of the shop.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This common-sense bill would simply ensure that the registration happens at the point of sale, before someone rides out of the shop.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project backs the move, stressing manufacturer responsibility. Attorney Daniel Flanzig says the law could clear streets of unregistered, dangerous vehicles. The bill is not yet law, but enforcement actions against illegal mopeds are already underway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident left Jacob Priley, a cyclist and advocate, critically injured. Hanif highlighted the intersection’s deadly history, referencing the 2021 death of Arcellie Muschamp. She pressed the Department of Transportation for urgent safety upgrades, saying, 'How many more crashes until the DOT pays attention?' Hanif noted the recent completion of a protected bike lane on Ninth Street but stressed that more action is needed. She thanked neighbors for their support and vowed to work with the DOT. So far in 2023, 3,702 cyclists have been injured and 22 killed on New York City streets. The city’s pace on safety remains too slow for those at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Enforcement on uncertified sales begins soon.</p><p class=mb3>"My bill will make sure the situation changes." -- Gale A. Brewer</p><p class=mb3>On September 14, 2023, the New York City Council passed a package of bills to fight lithium-ion battery fires. The main bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, creates a city-funded buy-back program for delivery workers to exchange faulty batteries and devices for safe, certified ones. The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
