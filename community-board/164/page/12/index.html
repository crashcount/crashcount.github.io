The city’s most fragile pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2024, the conflict between the City Council and Department of Transportation over the Streets Master Plan erupted. The DOT failed to meet 2023’s legal benchmarks: just 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes built out of 30 required, and 32 miles of protected bike lanes out of 50 mandated by 2019 law. Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives. More than half of New Yorkers remain far from protected bike lanes as daily cycling surges. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while officials pass the buck.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez asked council members for input; only six of 51 replied. Council Member Gale Brewer cited ignored past outreach. Joe Borelli dismissed bike lanes and DOT’s efforts.

Law aims to protect lives, streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2024, the City Council passed a package of bills led by Councilmember Gale A. Brewer (District 6). The legislation, heard in committee and passed on this date, increases penalties for businesses selling uncertified e-bikes and scooters with dangerous lithium-ion batteries. Brewer said, 'We are not only going after the batteries, we are going after the stores that are selling the batteries.' The FDNY will now assist the Department of Consumer and Worker Protections in enforcement. Fines for repeat violators can reach $2,000. Brewer’s second bill requires e-bike sellers to post safety information in stores and online, with fines up to $350. Councilmember Julie Menin sponsored additional reforms easing street vendor regulations and banning vending in bike lanes. The bills respond to a deadly spike in battery fires—18 killed in 2023, triple the previous year.

Workers pay steep fees to keep earning and avoid losing their rides.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published February 21, 2024, details the surge in moped registrations among New York City delivery workers. DMV data show ZIP codes with many deliveristas now lead in registered mopeds. The article quotes workers like Junior Pichardo, who says, 'If you have plates, [the police] won’t summons you.' Eric Macario and William Medina, both delivery workers, highlight confusion and lack of information about registration and insurance. Medina blames sellers for failing to inform buyers. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores have introduced a bill to require sellers to register mopeds before sale, but it remains pending. For now, advocates help workers navigate the system. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project says many only learn the rules after police seize their mopeds or issue tickets. The crackdown exposes systemic gaps, leaving vulnerable workers to bear the cost and risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsored by Timothy M. Kennedy with support from Jake Ashby, Jamaal Bailey, and others, the bill mandates street designs that protect everyone—not just drivers. The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The bill marks a shift away from car-first planning, forcing cities to build streets for people, not just traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Officials claim the move will ease crowding and reduce danger for walkers. Vendors, many disabled or veterans, say the ban guts their livelihoods overnight.</p><p class=mb3>On January 2, 2024, City Hall announced a blanket ban on street vendors from city bridges, effective January 3. The policy, not a council bill but a mayoral action, follows months of warnings and public debate. Mayor Adams said, "Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety." The Department of Transportation cited overcrowding and safety risks on the Brooklyn Bridge, where daily pedestrian numbers have doubled since 2021. Vendors and advocates, including Mohamed Attia of the Street Vendor Project, condemned the ban for stripping workers—many disabled or veterans—of income with no safety net. Upper West Side Council Member Gale Brewer proposed a compromise bill to allow regulated vending on wider bridge sections, but the administration pushed ahead with a total ban. The city claims the measure will protect pedestrians, but offers no new space or support for displaced vendors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, introduced April 11, 2023, and filed December 31, 2023, calls for 'allowing New York City to establish a lower speed limit, and enacting a crash victims bill of rights.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif led sponsorship, joined by Gutiérrez, Restler, and others. The package aims to cut speeds, redesign streets, and support crash victims. It would let the city set safer limits, require safe passing for cyclists, and mandate complete street design. The council’s action spotlights the urgent need to protect people walking, biking, and riding in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Chuck Schumer and Mayor Adams, would convert old newsstands at W. 72nd Street and Broadway into rest stops with bike parking, seating, and charging stations. Community Board 7 voted against the plan, citing safety and congestion fears. Katina Ellison of the West 71st Street Block Association called the idea 'clearly terrible and dangerous.' CB 7’s Andrew Albert, also on the MTA board, supports charging stations but wants a different site. Ken Coughlin of CB 7 called the opposition hypocritical, noting the neighborhood’s reliance on delivery workers. Council Member Gale Brewer supports smaller, less invasive infrastructure. The Parks Department plans to proceed, but no timeline is set. Vulnerable road users—delivery workers—remain exposed, with no safe place to rest or recharge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure rejects a total ban. It sets strict limits: only on spans at least 16 feet wide, with 20 feet between sellers. Enforcement remains a challenge.</p><p class=mb3>On December 15, 2023, Council Member Gale Brewer introduced a bill in the New York City Council to regulate street vending on bridges. The bill, debated in committee, would permit vendors only on bridge walkways at least 16 feet wide and require 20 feet between each seller. Bridge approaches would remain off-limits. Brewer stated, 'I believe strongly that a full ban on vendors is not necessary,' and argued for clear, enforceable rules. The Department of Transportation had proposed a total ban on vending across all city-owned bridges, citing overcrowding. Brewer’s bill seeks a middle ground, allowing limited vending while addressing safety and crowding. Vendor advocates welcomed relief from a total ban but warned the spacing rule would be hard to enforce. The bill’s fate remains undecided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution urges city and state to punish illegal dealers, enforce laws, and back Albany’s registration bill. Lawmakers say loopholes fuel chaos. Immigrants often misled. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On December 14, 2023, Community Board 7’s transportation committee passed a resolution, 8-1, demanding action against unregistered mopeds. The board called on the Department of Motor Vehicles to impose civil penalties on unregistered dealers and urged city and state officials to enforce laws against selling non-street-legal mopeds. The resolution also asks the city to consider a buy-back program for gas-powered mopeds. The matter, titled 'Upper West Side Panel Backs Resolution to Rein in Dangerous Mopeds,' supports Albany legislation requiring sellers to register mopeds with the DMV before sale. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores sponsor the bill. Bores said, 'We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets.' The board’s move aims to close loopholes, protect vulnerable road users, and address the chaos caused by unregistered mopeds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
