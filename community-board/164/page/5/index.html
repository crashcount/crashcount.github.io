Tension rises between speed, safety, and neighborhood calm.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (2025-06-08) reports that the city proposes restricting cars on 34th Street to create a busway between 3rd and 9th Avenues. Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated.

She woke in pain, face broken, spine injured. NYPD cracks down with criminal summonses. Cyclists protest. City Council stalls. Streets stay dangerous. Justice, tangled in policy.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on May 30, 2025, that the NYPD is issuing criminal summonses to e-bike riders for traffic infractions, citing a lack of City Council action on new regulations. Commissioner Tisch told the Council, "Pass e-bike regulations." Cyclists object to criminal charges for minor violations, arguing for civil penalties instead. The article highlights the case of Renee Baruch, hospitalized after an e-bike crash left her with facial fractures and a spinal injury. The NYPD’s new Quality of Life Division targets reckless e-bike use, but without updated laws, criminal summonses remain their only tool. The policy gap leaves vulnerable road users exposed and enforcement inconsistent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists chased the horse, warning others. The horse was not tethered to a hitching post, as none was nearby. Christina Hansen, union rep for carriage horses, stated, "There were no injuries or property damage reported, and there's currently no indication the horse's driver was negligent."

Brewer (District 6) took a public stance against the NYPD’s surge in criminal summonses for e-bike violations. In her editorial, Brewer wrote, 'Regulation, not criminal summonses, makes sense.' She condemned the 4,000% spike in summonses, highlighting the grave risks these pose to immigrant delivery workers, who face potential deportation for minor traffic infractions. Brewer argued that unsafe riding stems from unrealistic delivery deadlines set by companies like Grubhub and Uber, not from inherent recklessness. She called for regulation targeting delivery app practices and for companies to set realistic delivery times and prioritize safety. Brewer’s position: punish the companies, not the workers.
