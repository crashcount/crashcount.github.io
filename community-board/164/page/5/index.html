The matter, described as a 'City Council member public statement/rally regarding bus lane project,' saw Brewer call on DOT to remove two blocks from the crosstown bus lane plan, citing the area's 'residential character' and questioning the need due to 'current bus speeds.' Brewer, who once backed bus lanes on 14th, 34th, and 181st Streets, now argued for alternatives and said, 'I'm a bus rider who takes this bus every day. It's not slow.' DOT countered that parking would be preserved and loading zones added. Transit advocates criticized Brewer for ignoring data on slow westbound buses and the needs of 15,000 daily riders. Council Member Shaun Abreu, who represents the district, did not attend and stated he does not oppose the bus lane.

The proposal, announced in May, would convert a traffic lane in each direction to bus-only use between First and West End avenues, aiming to speed up the M96 and M106 routes. Brewer, who previously supported bus lanes elsewhere, told the crowd, 'There are concerns that we have. I think that you have to look at alternatives to making the bus go faster.' The matter, titled by Gothamist as 'Yet another NYC bus lane plan faces big fight, this time from angry Upper West Siders,' highlights tension between transit improvements and local access.

The DOT proposal, intended to speed up the M96 bus for 15,000 daily riders, would repurpose a travel lane in each direction while preserving curb parking. Abreu stated, "I wouldn’t say I’m opposed or in favor at this point," but called for more clarity and adjustments from DOT. The matter, described as a push to 'torpedo planned bus lane on 96th Street,' has drawn support from East Side's Community Board 8 and opposition from West Side locals and Council Member Gale Brewer, who suggested alternatives like bus signal priority. The debate centers on balancing transit improvements with residential curb access. No formal committee action or safety analysis has been reported.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Still, 23 other stations remain on hold after congestion pricing was paused, freezing $15 billion in planned improvements. Only 30% of stations are accessible.

In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal.

Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers.

The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Liz Krueger is open to tweaks if goals are met. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow opposes any revival. The MTA faces a $15 billion shortfall after the program’s pause. Policy experts warn that lowering the toll could weaken congestion relief and transit funding. No clear plan exists. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as gridlock and uncertainty persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure creates a pilot program to install speed cameras near schools, aiming to catch drivers who exceed posted limits. The authorization for the program expires December 31, 2028. Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push. The vote passed with strong support but faced opposition from several members. The bill’s summary reads: "Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2028." No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the measure targets driver speed in zones where children walk, bike, and cross.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi echoed, 'It needs to happen now.' Senator Liz Krueger called Hochul's move 'a staggering error.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll and business leader Kathy Wylde criticized the governor’s floated payroll tax hike as unfair to city businesses.

The plan, designed to charge most drivers $15 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street, would have funded $15 billion in MTA capital improvements. The bill’s summary warns: 'No plan B for transit investments should congestion pricing not go through.' Senator Liz Krueger, mentioned in the debate, criticized the lack of alternative funding, saying, 'She is not aware of what she is referring to or where she believes that money will come from.' The delay leaves critical projects—like subway accessibility, new signals, and electric buses—unfunded. Without this money, vulnerable riders face more delays, breakdowns, and unsafe conditions. The City Council and transit advocates express deep disappointment and concern for New York’s future.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transit funding hangs in limbo. Liz Krueger says the tax lacks support. Riders and workers face uncertainty as lawmakers reject new burdens and demand fairer solutions.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, State Sen. Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
