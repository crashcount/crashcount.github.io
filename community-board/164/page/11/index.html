One was seriously hurt.</strong> No deaths in the last twelve months. But the years before left scars. Since 2022, 217 people have been injured here. Six were seriously hurt. One died. Most were walking, riding, or just trying to cross the street. Trucks, bikes, cars, mopeds—each left their mark. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders Talk. Streets Wait.</h3><p><strong>Local leaders say the right words.</strong> They talk of Vision Zero, of safer streets, of new laws. But the carriages still run. The speed limits stay high. The cameras blink on and off. Each delay is a risk. Each silence is a choice. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. The law to keep speed cameras alive is up for renewal. It hangs by a thread.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand permanent speed cameras.

Their children killed by reckless drivers. They demand lawmakers let New York City set its own speed limits. The Assembly stalls. Grief and anger fill the halls. No more excuses. They want action. Now.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2023, two mothers began a hunger strike at the State Capitol, demanding action on Sammy’s Law. The bill, first introduced in 2020 by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and carried in the Assembly by Linda Rosenthal, would let New York City set speed limits below 25 mph. The City Council backed the measure with a 'home rule' message last month. But Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie has not brought it to a vote. The matter title: 'Sammy’s Law.' Amy Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed in 2013, and Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, whose son Bryan was killed in 2006, lead the protest. Mendieta-Cuapio says, 'We need to pass Sammy's Law today, no more excuses.' Lawmakers hide behind closed doors. The mothers refuse to let their children’s deaths be ignored.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to 'prohibit the sale or distribution of fraudulent license plates, including fraudulent temporary license plates,' and to ban materials that obscure plates. Civil penalties ranged from $300 to $2,000. Council Member Marjorie Velázquez led as primary sponsor, joined by Feliz, Restler, Yeger, Menin, Schulman, and many others. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst reviewed its impact for vulnerable road users. The danger from untraceable vehicles remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The deal follows a $1.3 million settlement over unnecessary work, including extra electrical poles and poor training. The contract was approved under Mayor Adams and Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, while Verra was under Department of Investigation monitorship. Manhattan Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer questioned the decision, stating, 'It is bewildering how you end up with a $1.3 million settlement... and then you get a new contract for more than $300 million.' The city comptroller’s office reviewed the settlement before approval. City data shows a 73% drop in speeding in camera-monitored school zones, but Brewer’s concerns highlight ongoing doubts about oversight and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On April 5, 2023, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (District 28) responded to a report showing New York City is owed more than $1 billion in unpaid parking and speeding fines. The Independent Budget Office found $1.02 billion in unpaid traffic fines from 2017 to 2022, including camera tickets for speeding and red lights. The matter, titled 'Ticket to slide: NYC owed more than $1 billion in unpaid parking, speeding fines, report finds,' highlights growing debt as enforcement lags. Adams, along with Comptroller Brad Lander, criticized further city agency budget cuts, urging the city to collect owed fines instead. The report notes that while 24/7 school-zone speed cameras have reduced speeding, the city has failed to stop drivers from evading cameras with defaced or fake plates—letting dangerous drivers escape accountability. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in committee, fills the funding gap and stops a fare hike. It launches a free bus pilot in low-income and commercial districts. The bill, backed by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, does not include the $300 million needed to run buses and subways every six minutes off-peak. The matter summary states: 'Legislators in Albany have proposed a budget to fill the MTA's fiscal hole, avert a fare hike, and fund a small pilot of free buses.' Hoylman-Sigal supported ending Madison Square Garden’s tax break to help fund transit. Advocates and lawmakers like Zohran Mamdani blasted the omission, warning that infrequent service leaves riders stranded and exposed. The budget keeps the system afloat but fails to deliver safer, more reliable transit for those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
