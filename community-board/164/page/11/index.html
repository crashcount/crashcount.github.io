It has not used it. The law to keep speed cameras alive is up for renewal. It hangs by a thread.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

The City Council delivered the required home rule message. Amy Cohen, mother of Sammy, pressed the Assembly: "We are demanding that the Assembly bring the bill to a vote." Assemblyman Daniel Rosenthal withdrew support, claiming, "This bill is about revenue, not public safety."

They demanded lawmakers pass Sammy’s Law. The bill lets the city set its own speed limits. Brad Hoylman-Sigal led the charge. The law is named for a child killed by a car. The fight is urgent. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2023, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and other NYC officials lobbied the state legislature to pass key transportation and housing bills before the session ends June 9. The centerpiece is 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let New York City set its own speed limits, potentially lowering them to 20 mph. Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted. Mayor Adams’ administration also pushed for affordable housing reforms. The push for Sammy’s Law is a fight to give NYC control over its streets and protect vulnerable road users from deadly speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Over $1 billion owed. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams slams budget cuts. She demands the city collect what drivers owe. Unpaid tickets mean reckless drivers dodge consequences. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On April 5, 2023, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (District 28) responded to a report showing New York City is owed more than $1 billion in unpaid parking and speeding fines. The Independent Budget Office found $1.02 billion in unpaid traffic fines from 2017 to 2022, including camera tickets for speeding and red lights. The matter, titled 'Ticket to slide: NYC owed more than $1 billion in unpaid parking, speeding fines, report finds,' highlights growing debt as enforcement lags. Adams, along with Comptroller Brad Lander, criticized further city agency budget cuts, urging the city to collect owed fines instead. The report notes that while 24/7 school-zone speed cameras have reduced speeding, the city has failed to stop drivers from evading cameras with defaced or fake plates—letting dangerous drivers escape accountability. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, requested by Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer (District 6), revealed that 'delinquents owe New York City a staggering $2.1 billion in bills racked up since 2017 for parking, traffic, safety code, and property-related violations.' Brewer stated, 'We don’t do a good job of collecting this money. We have to do a better job.' The Independent Budget Office found over $1 billion in uncollected parking and red light camera fines, with the backlog rising as the city increases automated enforcement. The unpaid fines represent a systemic failure to hold dangerous drivers accountable, leaving pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The discussion underscores the urgent need for action to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The session focused on the widespread use of sidewalks for police parking. Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey defended the practice, saying, 'There’s not enough parking spots.' Councilmember Althea Stevens, representing District 16, highlighted the issue’s impact on her district: 'It becomes very difficult. And not just for me, but even to drive down.' Councilmember Gale Brewer also pressed the NYPD, calling for fewer police and private cars parked illegally. Transit advocates and the public questioned why officers do not use public transit. The Adams administration claims it will crack down on illegal parking, but past actions suggest otherwise.

The matter summary states: 'Legislators in Albany have proposed a budget to fill the MTA's fiscal hole, avert a fare hike, and fund a small pilot of free buses.' Hoylman-Sigal supported ending Madison Square Garden’s tax break to help fund transit.

Advocates like Betsy Plum criticized the omission: 'The legislature's budget ignores millions of riders stranded 12, 15, 20 minutes or more on subway platforms and at bus stops.'
