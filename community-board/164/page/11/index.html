One was seriously hurt.</strong> No deaths in the last twelve months. But the years before left scars. Since 2022, 217 people have been injured here. Six were seriously hurt. One died.

But the carriages still run. The speed limits stay high. The cameras blink on and off. Each delay is a risk. Each silence is a choice. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. The law to keep speed cameras alive is up for renewal. It hangs by a thread.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

The bill, carried by State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal, stalled in the Assembly despite strong support from the City Council and Mayor. Council Member Jen Gutierrez called the refusal to vote 'unbelievable,' saying, 'Families across the city deserve this vote.' Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother, called the inaction 'unconscionable.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said the bill lacks support to reach the floor. The bill passed the City Council’s home rule message but faces Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie’s resistance.

Brad Hoylman-Sigal and other NYC officials lobbied the state legislature to pass key transportation and housing bills before the session ends June 9. The centerpiece is 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let New York City set its own speed limits, potentially lowering them to 20 mph. Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted. Mayor Adams’ administration also pushed for affordable housing reforms. The push for Sammy’s Law is a fight to give NYC control over its streets and protect vulnerable road users from deadly speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Independent Budget Office found $1.02 billion in unpaid traffic fines from 2017 to 2022, including camera tickets for speeding and red lights. The matter, titled 'Ticket to slide: NYC owed more than $1 billion in unpaid parking, speeding fines, report finds,' highlights growing debt as enforcement lags. Adams, along with Comptroller Brad Lander, criticized further city agency budget cuts, urging the city to collect owed fines instead. The report notes that while 24/7 school-zone speed cameras have reduced speeding, the city has failed to stop drivers from evading cameras with defaced or fake plates—letting dangerous drivers escape accountability. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users remain exposed while scofflaws dodge penalties.</p><p class=mb3>On April 5, 2023, the City Council held an oversight and budget discussion on the collection of transportation-related fines. The matter, requested by Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer (District 6), revealed that 'delinquents owe New York City a staggering $2.1 billion in bills racked up since 2017 for parking, traffic, safety code, and property-related violations.' Brewer stated, 'We don’t do a good job of collecting this money. We have to do a better job.' The Independent Budget Office found over $1 billion in uncollected parking and red light camera fines, with the backlog rising as the city increases automated enforcement. The unpaid fines represent a systemic failure to hold dangerous drivers accountable, leaving pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The discussion underscores the urgent need for action to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The session focused on the widespread use of sidewalks for police parking. Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey defended the practice, saying, 'There’s not enough parking spots.' Councilmember Althea Stevens, representing District 16, highlighted the issue’s impact on her district: 'It becomes very difficult. And not just for me, but even to drive down.' Councilmember Gale Brewer also pressed the NYPD, calling for fewer police and private cars parked illegally. Transit advocates and the public questioned why officers do not use public transit. The Adams administration claims it will crack down on illegal parking, but past actions suggest otherwise. The hearing exposed the city’s failure to protect sidewalks for pedestrians, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hoylman-Sigal supported ending Madison Square Garden’s tax break to help fund transit.

The bill, still under negotiation before the April 1 deadline, does not include the $300 million sought to boost off-peak bus and subway service to every six minutes. The matter summary reads: 'Legislators in Albany have proposed a budget to fill the MTA's fiscal hole, avert a fare hike, and fund a small pilot of free buses across New York City.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Andrew Gounardes pledged to keep fighting for better frequency. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber praised stable funding. Advocates like Betsy Plum criticized the omission: 'The legislature's budget ignores millions of riders stranded 12, 15, 20 minutes or more on subway platforms and at bus stops.' The budget’s failure to expand service leaves vulnerable riders waiting longer, exposed to danger and delay.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility.

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
