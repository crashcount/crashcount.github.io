The change would broaden the definition of 'processing device,' letting more vehicles idle legally. Manhattan Community Board 4 voted unanimously to reject the change, warning, 'These exemptions... would create an argument that just about any activity that requires power in a vehicle is an idling defense.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman testified, 'Drivers most often idle in front of highly trafficked pedestrian areas... those that live near large roadways face serious health repercussions.' Advocates, residents, and Dr. Patrick Schnell all opposed the proposal, citing health and environmental harm. Spectrum requested a variance, but all testimony opposed it. The DEP claims the change clarifies the law, but enforcement is already weak and large companies are frequent violators.

The bill, still in early stages, aims to ban advertising of rapid delivery times. The matter summary reads: 'ban apps from advertising quick delivery times, arguing they encourage delivery workers to break traffic laws and endanger themselves and pedestrians.' Brewer also pressed for enforcement against 'dark stores' operating in retail zones. She criticized Gorillas' changes as cosmetic, saying, 'They're doing this just to conform [to zoning rules] but it's not really their model.' Councilman Christopher Marte is leading the bill. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the council’s focus is clear: speed kills, and zoning violations breed chaos.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Erik Bottcher and State Senator Brad Hoylman responded by rallying with advocacy groups, demanding protected bike lanes on 10th and 11th avenues. Hoylman tweeted, 'The City must make the streets of the West Side safer!' The Hudson River Greenway, a nearby bike path, bans legal e-bikes, forcing riders like Kwan onto dangerous streets.

It found speed cameras are evenly distributed and reduce crashes, but dangerous road design still puts lives at risk. Adams and other leaders called for more cameras and urgent street redesigns, echoing the article’s summary: 'Cameras have led to fewer crashes, injuries, and fatalities, but high numbers of tickets in some neighborhoods are attributed to unsafe road design, not camera placement.' Community voices stressed that automated enforcement helps, but cannot replace permanent fixes to deadly streets. The Department of Transportation’s lack of transparency on camera locations remains a concern.

Wilfredo Florentino, Brooklyn Community Board 5, says, “Just placing cameras ain't gonna cut it.” The analysis shows that dangerous, wide arterials in communities of color drive up traffic violence. Advocates and officials agree: automated enforcement helps, but only street redesigns will end the bloodshed. The Department of Transportation still withholds exact camera locations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hall remains bare.</p><p class=mb3>On February 4, 2022, a group of Manhattan elected officials, including State Senator Brad Hoylman, sent a letter demanding public seating at Moynihan Train Hall. The matter, titled 'Legislators Demand Public Seating at the Moynihan Train Hall,' highlights the lack of benches in the busy transit hub. The letter states, 'To ensure everyone can enjoy this public good, we request the installation of additional seating.' Lawmakers Hoylman, Nadler, Jackson, Gottfried, Levine, and Bottcher signed the letter. They note that the small waiting area for ticketed passengers is not enough, forcing travelers—especially seniors—to sit on the floor or wander in search of a seat. The officials reject exclusionary design that targets unhoused people, urging services and outreach instead. Amtrak has not responded. The push for seating centers the needs of all passengers, especially the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill targets car dominance, aims to cut congestion, and free space for homes. Sen. Hoylman leads the charge. The move could shift city streets, making room for people, not just cars.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill, introduced by Sen. Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan), would ban cities from forcing developers to build off-street parking in new projects. The bill, considered as of January 31, 2022, is under review by the state legislature. The measure, described as aiming to 'encourage public transit use, reduce car ownership, and address climate change,' would give New York City 180 days to update zoning if passed. Sen. Hoylman, the sponsor, calls parking minimums 'backwards' and a barrier to affordable housing. Sen. Alessandra Biaggi (D-Bronx) has shown support for similar efforts. The Department of City Planning and the governor's office will review the legislation if it advances. The bill does not ban parking outright, but removes the mandate, letting developers decide. Advocates say this could lower costs and open space for housing or community needs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
