The plan, called 'The Future of Fifth,' will double sidewalk space, shorten crosswalks, and add over 230 tree planters. Adams said, 'We're making Fifth Avenue more walkable, greener and safer.' The project aims to address sidewalk congestion and improve safety for pedestrians. City Councilmember Keith Powers noted, 'you can feel congestion on the sidewalks.'

She condemned the 4,000% spike in summonses, highlighting the grave risks these pose to immigrant delivery workers, who face potential deportation for minor traffic infractions. Brewer argued that unsafe riding stems from unrealistic delivery deadlines set by companies like Grubhub and Uber, not from inherent recklessness. She called for regulation targeting delivery app practices and for companies to set realistic delivery times and prioritize safety. Brewer’s position: punish the companies, not the workers.

Bill Weber (R-Rockland) opposed the measure, citing toll burdens and limited transit options. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) and Transportation Chair Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester) defended the plan, highlighting increased MTA revenue and minimal impact on local businesses. The matter summary reads: 'State legislators from the suburbs, particularly Republican lawmakers, voiced strong opposition to congestion pricing during the passage of Gov.

Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
