One was seriously hurt.</strong> No deaths in the last twelve months. But the years before left scars. Since 2022, 217 people have been injured here. Six were seriously hurt. One died. Most were walking, riding, or just trying to cross the street. Trucks, bikes, cars, mopeds—each left their mark. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders Talk. Streets Wait.</h3><p><strong>Local leaders say the right words.</strong> They talk of Vision Zero, of safer streets, of new laws. But the carriages still run. The speed limits stay high. The cameras blink on and off. Each delay is a risk. Each silence is a choice. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. The law to keep speed cameras alive is up for renewal. It hangs by a thread.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand permanent speed cameras.

Stand with the living before they become the lost.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren.

The debate follows congestion pricing, which, as the bill summary states, has made free street parking uptown scarce and pushed more drivers into residential neighborhoods. State Senator Robert Jackson sponsors a parallel bill in Albany. De La Rosa and Jackson argue that local residents lose parking to out-of-state drivers. Councilmember Gale Brewer warns that low permit prices could increase car ownership and worsen parking shortages, citing past failures in other cities. Kate Slevin of the Regional Plan Association questions whether a permit system would be enforced, given the city's history of placard abuse. The bill's impact on vulnerable road users remains unaddressed.

The matter, titled "MTA eyes new taxes, fees to plug $33B budget hole — even after NYC’s $9 congestion toll!", landed in the spotlight after the new toll failed to close the gap. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, district 35, formally objected to the unfunded capital plan with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. Their joint letter blocked the plan’s January 1 start, forcing negotiations. Governor Hochul, who backs the $68 billion plan, promised no income tax hikes but left other taxes and fees on the table. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called for transparency. The MTA’s future—and the safety of those who rely on it—hangs in the balance.

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

Brewer (District 6) took a public stance in an editorial titled, "NYC must curb the e-bikes: Regulations should be on the delivery apps." Brewer opposes citywide licensing and registration of all e-bikes, a measure supported by Councilman Bob Holden, calling it impractical. Instead, she urges the City Council to target commercial e-bike use by requiring delivery giants like Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub, and Amazon to track their contractors’ speed, direction, and sidewalk riding, and report violations to city regulators. Brewer also proposes a 15 mph speed limit for e-bikes and mandates running lights for visibility. She highlights the danger of unsafe lithium-ion batteries and calls for stricter oversight. Brewer’s approach shifts responsibility from individual riders to the corporations profiting from delivery, aiming to protect the city’s 8 million pedestrians from reckless riding and battery fires.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Councilmember Bob Holden, claims to address 'the proliferation of these vehicles' and their impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety. Councilmember Vickie Paladino, District 19, insisted, 'This is a safety issue.' Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez countered, 'We agree with the intent, but we believe that mandating registration and licensing is not a solution.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams warned the bill would 'have a disparate impact on low-income individuals, people of color, and undocumented migrants.' A separate resolution from Councilmember Gale Brewer supports licensing only for commercial e-bikes.
