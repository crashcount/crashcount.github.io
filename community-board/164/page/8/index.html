The department must also study their impact compared to unlit signs.

The DOT failed to meet 2023’s legal benchmarks: just 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes built out of 30 required, and 32 miles of protected bike lanes out of 50 mandated by 2019 law. Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives. More than half of New Yorkers remain far from protected bike lanes as daily cycling surges. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while officials pass the buck.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a conflict over 'the implementation of street safety improvements, particularly protected bike lanes and bus lanes,' exposes deep rifts. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez asked council members for input; only six of 51 replied. Council Member Gale Brewer cited ignored past outreach. Joe Borelli dismissed bike lanes and DOT’s efforts. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers insisted the agency, not lawmakers, must pick locations. The city is failing to meet legal benchmarks for new lanes. Mayor Adams has sidelined mandates for community feedback. Advocates blame both the council and mayor for delays, missed projects, and rising danger. Decisive leadership is missing. The city’s legal obligations for street safety remain unmet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Penalties rise. FDNY joins enforcement. Vendors face new rules—no more goods in bike lanes. Brewer and Menin push reforms. Fires killed 18 last year. Law aims to protect lives, streets.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2024, the City Council passed a package of bills led by Councilmember Gale A. Brewer (District 6). The legislation, heard in committee and passed on this date, increases penalties for businesses selling uncertified e-bikes and scooters with dangerous lithium-ion batteries. Brewer said, 'We are not only going after the batteries, we are going after the stores that are selling the batteries.' The FDNY will now assist the Department of Consumer and Worker Protections in enforcement. Fines for repeat violators can reach $2,000. Brewer’s second bill requires e-bike sellers to post safety information in stores and online, with fines up to $350. Councilmember Julie Menin sponsored additional reforms easing street vendor regulations and banning vending in bike lanes. The bills respond to a deadly spike in battery fires—18 killed in 2023, triple the previous year. Lawmakers aim to protect vulnerable road users and workers who rely on these devices.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Eric Macario and William Medina, both delivery workers, highlight confusion and lack of information about registration and insurance. Medina blames sellers for failing to inform buyers. State Sen.

Bottcher said, 'the vast majority of deaths and injuries are caused by cars.' Simone highlighted delivery app pressure on workers to break laws. Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project noted delivery workers face daily risks and exploitation. The campaign, first in English and Spanish, will expand citywide. The focus remains: cars are the real threat, but all street users must be considered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Eric Adams said, 'Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety.' The ban aims to improve pedestrian flow on the crowded bridge, which sees over 34,000 walkers on a fall weekend. Supporters of vendors mourned the loss of affordable food and art.

The policy, not a council bill but a mayoral action, follows months of warnings and public debate. Mayor Adams said, "Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety." The Department of Transportation cited overcrowding and safety risks on the Brooklyn Bridge, where daily pedestrian numbers have doubled since 2021. Vendors and advocates, including Mohamed Attia of the Street Vendor Project, condemned the ban for stripping workers—many disabled or veterans—of income with no safety net. Upper West Side Council Member Gale Brewer proposed a compromise bill to allow regulated vending on wider bridge sections, but the administration pushed ahead with a total ban. The city claims the measure will protect pedestrians, but offers no new space or support for displaced vendors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

CB 7’s Andrew Albert, also on the MTA board, supports charging stations but wants a different site. Ken Coughlin of CB 7 called the opposition hypocritical, noting the neighborhood’s reliance on delivery workers. Council Member Gale Brewer supports smaller, less invasive infrastructure.

Enforcement remains a challenge.</p><p class=mb3>On December 15, 2023, Council Member Gale Brewer introduced a bill in the New York City Council to regulate street vending on bridges. The bill, debated in committee, would permit vendors only on bridge walkways at least 16 feet wide and require 20 feet between each seller. Bridge approaches would remain off-limits. Brewer stated, 'I believe strongly that a full ban on vendors is not necessary,' and argued for clear, enforceable rules. The Department of Transportation had proposed a total ban on vending across all city-owned bridges, citing overcrowding. Brewer’s bill seeks a middle ground, allowing limited vending while addressing safety and crowding. Vendor advocates welcomed relief from a total ban but warned the spacing rule would be hard to enforce. The bill’s fate remains undecided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board called on the Department of Motor Vehicles to impose civil penalties on unregistered dealers and urged city and state officials to enforce laws against selling non-street-legal mopeds. The resolution also asks the city to consider a buy-back program for gas-powered mopeds. The matter, titled 'Upper West Side Panel Backs Resolution to Rein in Dangerous Mopeds,' supports Albany legislation requiring sellers to register mopeds with the DMV before sale. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores sponsor the bill. Bores said, 'We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets.'
