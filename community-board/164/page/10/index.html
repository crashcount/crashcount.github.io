It has not used it. The law to keep speed cameras alive is up for renewal. It hangs by a thread.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

They argue EVs cut smog, so drivers deserve a break. Critics warn this move keeps streets clogged. Fewer cars mean fewer crashes. The fight pits clean air against crowded roads.</p><p class=mb3>On July 31, 2023, a group of Manhattan elected officials—including Assembly Members Alex Bores, Eddie Gibbs, Deborah Glick, Harvey Epstein, Rebecca Seawright; State Senators Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Liz Krueger, Kristen Gonzalez; and Borough President Mark Levine—sent a letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. They urged a congestion pricing discount for electric vehicles, claiming EVs 'do not contribute significantly to the smog and pollution of the Central Business District.' Assembly Member Bores led the effort, stating, 'when it comes to the environmental case, an electric vehicle is just a different profile than a gas-guzzling one.' The officials oppose credits for bridge and tunnel crossings. Congestion pricing advocates and environmental groups counter that EV discounts undermine the core goal: fewer cars, less traffic, safer streets. They note other cities are ending such breaks. The proposal highlights a tension—cleaner air versus safer, less crowded roads for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The demonstration targeted the Manhattan congestion pricing plan, which aims to raise $15 billion for the MTA and cut traffic. Drivers argued they already pay hefty surcharges and cannot survive another fee. Council Member Gale A. Brewer (District 6) supported the cabbies, both in a letter to MTA chairman Janno Lieber and at the rally. Brewer said, 'I support the concept, but my main topic was not to charge yellow cabs, period. Not even once.' The protest called for a full exemption for yellow and green cab drivers. The MTA has proposed tolls from $9 to $23, but drivers say even a once-a-day charge would threaten their survival. The event underscored the tension between funding transit and protecting workers who keep the city moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The enforcement action follows years of crackdowns dating back to Mayor Bloomberg, ramped up under Mayor de Blasio. Police say the seizures make streets safer, but city crash data show cars and trucks—not e-bikes or mopeds—cause most pedestrian injuries. Delivery worker Roziev Akmal warned, 'Livelihoods will be ruined because of the seizure.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called it 'another example where you see deliveristas being economically impacted.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman and Council Member Gale Brewer cited constituent complaints, but advocates and legal experts argue enforcement targets workers, not the root causes. The crackdown leaves low-paid, mostly immigrant workers exposed to fines, lost income, and road danger, while app companies escape responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, described as giving 'absolute priority for pedestrians,' will remove 70,000 parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, widen sidewalks, and expand bike lanes. Hidalgo rejects harsh measures against e-bikes, focusing instead on reducing car dominance and discouraging SUVs through progressive parking fees. Council Member Gale A.

The move could make bike-share easier, but fractured agencies and costly upgrades stand in the way.</p><p class=mb3>On June 8, 2023, State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Midtown West) urged the MTA and Lyft to integrate OMNY, the city’s contactless fare system, with Citi Bike. In a letter, Hoylman-Sigal wrote, "We urge you to create a unified payment system as expeditiously as possible." The proposal aims to remove barriers for would-be Citi Bike users and address issues like vandalized QR codes. The bill is a policy proposal, not yet in committee or up for a vote. Hoylman-Sigal’s push highlights the fractured nature of New York’s fare systems, with separate payments for subways, bikes, ferries, and regional trains. While OMNY integration could streamline access, technical and financial hurdles remain. The MTA and Cubic, OMNY’s contractor, say they are reviewing expansion opportunities. No direct safety impact assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
