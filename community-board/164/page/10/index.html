The bill states: “prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.” Council Member Erik D. Bottcher leads, joined by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and over two dozen co-sponsors. The law orders the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections each year, up from 100. The city must also run outreach and education. The bill aims to keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike. No more hiding behind parked cars.

The Committee on Consumer Affairs advanced the bills, with Council Member Gale Brewer introducing both. The laws allow FDNY to close retailers who breach Local Law 39 three times in three years. The official matter summary states: 'The city can now forcibly close repeat offender shops that sell illegal lithium-ion batteries and micromobility devices.' Department of Consumer and Worker Protection Commissioner Vera Mayuga called the issue urgent. Baruch Herzfeld, CEO of Pop Wheels, backed the law but urged more incentives for certified batteries and safe charging. While fires have dropped since last year, uncertified batteries still pose danger. The city has inspected over 650 shops and issued 275 violations, but online sales remain a loophole.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets grow harsher for the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On October 8, 2024, Council Member Gale Brewer publicly reversed her stance, now supporting state-level e-bike registration and a blanket ban on e-bikes in city parks, as proposed in Intro 60. Brewer, speaking at an E-Vehicle Safety Alliance town hall, said, "I will sign on to that bill. That's not an issue." She attributes her change to the existence of state bills and constituent pressure, but refuses to back Council Member Bob Holden's city bill. Julie Menin also endorsed strict registration and park bans. Critics, including advocacy groups, warn these measures will hit low-wage, immigrant delivery workers hardest and undermine efforts to reduce car use. Data shows pedestrian injuries from e-bikes remain flat, while cars cause most harm. Brewer's shift marks a retreat from policies that protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not tied to a specific bill number, is led by the Department of Transportation and replaces a traffic lane in each direction between West End Avenue and 2nd Avenue. The matter aims to 'speed up crosstown buses like the M96 and M106.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, has sided with residents opposing the change, though she did not comment for the record. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the new lane will make commutes 'faster, more reliable, and safer for everyone.' The bus lane will operate 24/7, except for a short eastbound stretch. DOT notes that 74% of 96th Street residents do not own cars, and most commute by transit, bike, or foot.

The matter, titled 'DOT begins construction of new bus lanes along Manhattan’s 96th Street,' aims to improve service for 15,500 weekday riders. Councilmember Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, held a rally earlier in the month expressing concerns about lost curb space and pushed for alternative solutions. Brewer sent a letter to DOT on behalf of residents, stating, 'All I can say is that I did what I did to represent them.' DOT officials countered that the redesign will reduce congestion and retain curb access. The project includes dedicated bus lanes, left-turn bays, and treatments to slow drivers. Most residents in the area rely on transit, walking, or cycling.
