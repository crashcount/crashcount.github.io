A cyclist hits her. She falls. Months later, it happens again. She is 72. Her kidney is torn. The police do not come. No report is filed. She is left to heal alone. <em>“Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene,”</em> she <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/she-was-hit-twice-by-bikes-in-central-park-and-says-nypd-never-followed-up-IH4810802>tells the press</a>.</p><p>In the last year, <strong>one person died and two suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. Forty more were hurt. In three years, two people have died, seven have been seriously injured, and 226 have been wounded in 404 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. A 43-year-old man on an e-bike died on the 97th Street Transverse. A 60-year-old pedestrian was killed by a garbage truck at Central Park North. A city worker, fixing a sign, was slashed by a cyclist after a near miss. <em>“It looked like the guy on the bicycle tried to apologize&mldr; And the guy was, like, Get the f&mdash; away from me! You just sliced me!”</em> a <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>witness said</a>.</p><p>Pedestrians, cyclists, children. They are the ones who fall. Cars, trucks, bikes, mopeds—they all draw blood. But the biggest wounds come from the biggest machines. Trucks and buses killed one, cars and SUVs hurt 21, bikes left ten pedestrians injured or worse.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Local leaders have moved. Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted to curb repeat speeders</a> with mandatory speed limiters. Assembly Member Micah Lasher voted to extend school speed zones. But the city still waits for a default 20 mph limit. Enforcement is scattershot. Reports are missing. The silence after a crash is as loud as the sirens that never come.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</strong></h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets where the old and young can walk without fear. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled "MTA eyes new taxes, fees to plug $33B budget hole — even after NYC’s $9 congestion toll!", landed in the spotlight after the new toll failed to close the gap. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, district 35, formally objected to the unfunded capital plan with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. Their joint letter blocked the plan’s January 1 start, forcing negotiations. Governor Hochul, who backs the $68 billion plan, promised no income tax hikes but left other taxes and fees on the table.

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation. The case raises questions about police pursuit tactics and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer (District 6) took a public stance in an editorial titled, "NYC must curb the e-bikes: Regulations should be on the delivery apps." Brewer opposes citywide licensing and registration of all e-bikes, a measure supported by Councilman Bob Holden, calling it impractical. Instead, she urges the City Council to target commercial e-bike use by requiring delivery giants like Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub, and Amazon to track their contractors’ speed, direction, and sidewalk riding, and report violations to city regulators. Brewer also proposes a 15 mph speed limit for e-bikes and mandates running lights for visibility. She highlights the danger of unsafe lithium-ion batteries and calls for stricter oversight. Brewer’s approach shifts responsibility from individual riders to the corporations profiting from delivery, aiming to protect the city’s 8 million pedestrians from reckless riding and battery fires.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Councilmember Bob Holden, claims to address 'the proliferation of these vehicles' and their impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety. Councilmember Vickie Paladino, District 19, insisted, 'This is a safety issue.' Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez countered, 'We agree with the intent, but we believe that mandating registration and licensing is not a solution.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams warned the bill would 'have a disparate impact on low-income individuals, people of color, and undocumented migrants.' A separate resolution from Councilmember Gale Brewer supports licensing only for commercial e-bikes.
