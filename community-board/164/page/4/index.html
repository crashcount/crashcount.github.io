One was seriously hurt.</strong> No deaths in the last twelve months. But the years before left scars. Since 2022, 217 people have been injured here. Six were seriously hurt. One died. Most were walking, riding, or just trying to cross the street. Trucks, bikes, cars, mopeds—each left their mark. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders Talk. Streets Wait.</h3><p><strong>Local leaders say the right words.</strong> They talk of Vision Zero, of safer streets, of new laws. But the carriages still run. The speed limits stay high. The cameras blink on and off. Each delay is a risk. Each silence is a choice. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. The law to keep speed cameras alive is up for renewal. It hangs by a thread.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand permanent speed cameras.
