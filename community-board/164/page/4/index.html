One was seriously hurt.</strong> No deaths in the last twelve months. But the years before left scars. Since 2022, 217 people have been injured here. Six were seriously hurt. One died. Most were walking, riding, or just trying to cross the street. Trucks, bikes, cars, mopeds—each left their mark. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders Talk. Streets Wait.</h3><p><strong>Local leaders say the right words.</strong> They talk of Vision Zero, of safer streets, of new laws. But the carriages still run. The speed limits stay high. The cameras blink on and off. Each delay is a risk. Each silence is a choice. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. The law to keep speed cameras alive is up for renewal. It hangs by a thread.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand permanent speed cameras.

Stand with the living before they become the lost.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren.

Brewer (District 6) took a public stance in an editorial titled, "NYC must curb the e-bikes: Regulations should be on the delivery apps." Brewer opposes citywide licensing and registration of all e-bikes, a measure supported by Councilman Bob Holden, calling it impractical. Instead, she urges the City Council to target commercial e-bike use by requiring delivery giants like Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub, and Amazon to track their contractors’ speed, direction, and sidewalk riding, and report violations to city regulators. Brewer also proposes a 15 mph speed limit for e-bikes and mandates running lights for visibility. She highlights the danger of unsafe lithium-ion batteries and calls for stricter oversight. Brewer’s approach shifts responsibility from individual riders to the corporations profiting from delivery, aiming to protect the city’s 8 million pedestrians from reckless riding and battery fires.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Vickie Paladino, District 19, insisted, 'This is a safety issue.' Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez countered, 'We agree with the intent, but we believe that mandating registration and licensing is not a solution.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams warned the bill would 'have a disparate impact on low-income individuals, people of color, and undocumented migrants.'

Brewer, representing District 6, held a rally earlier in the month expressing concerns about lost curb space and pushed for alternative solutions. Brewer sent a letter to DOT on behalf of residents, stating, 'All I can say is that I did what I did to represent them.' DOT officials countered that the redesign will reduce congestion and retain curb access. The project includes dedicated bus lanes, left-turn bays, and treatments to slow drivers. Most residents in the area rely on transit, walking, or cycling. The city expects the redesign to make commutes faster and safer for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
