The unicycle, capable of speeds over 40 mph, struck Carolyn Backus, who was riding a standard bike. The unicycle operator was hospitalized in critical but stable condition. NYPD initially charged Backus with leaving the scene, but the charge was dropped. A spokesperson clarified, 'She also remained on scene for about 45 minutes after the crash and waited for paramedics.' The incident highlights risks from high-speed, illegal vehicles in crowded park spaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The campaign, covered by Streetsblog NYC, pushes Americans to drive to landmarks like Central Park. Council Member Gale Brewer slammed the idea, saying, 'No! And no cars are allowed in Central Park!' Critics note Duffy’s plan ignores New York’s transit strengths and threatens vulnerable road users. Safety analysts warn: 'Encouraging more driving in transit-rich, congested areas increases vehicle traffic, which raises risks for pedestrians and cyclists and undermines mode shift toward safer, more equitable transportation.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In Central Park, pedestrians have the right of way at all times.
