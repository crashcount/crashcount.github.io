Two sedans struck them. Both died. That was November. Six months later, a motorcyclist burned on the same boulevard after a driver chased him down and ran him over. The bike caught fire. The man died. The driver kept going. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/driver-charged-murder-deadly-nyc-road-rage-crash-da-says>&ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes,&rdquo; said District Attorney Melinda Katz</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>two people died and 114 were injured</strong> in crashes in Queens CB82. Not one was marked as a serious injury, but the dead do not heal. The numbers do not stop.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>Four people have died since 2022.</strong> Two were pedestrians, both killed by cars. One was a motorcyclist. The last was a driver. <strong>275 people have been hurt</strong>. Two suffered serious injuries. Most were young. Some were old. Five children were injured in the last year alone.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed two people. Motorcycles killed one.</strong> No one died on a bike. But every crash leaves someone broken.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But the limit on Woodhaven Boulevard is still 30. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The city has not lowered the speed limit here. The council has not demanded it. The mayor has not acted. The dead wait for action.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the limit stays high, every day the cameras go dark, another family risks losing someone.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal aims to increase housing near transit, allow mixed-use zoning, and eliminate parking mandates. Council Members Joann Ariola and Vicki Paladino led opposition, calling the plan an 'unmitigated disaster' and disputing housing data. Ariola argued, 'That's what they bought in the suburbs for.' Other Queens officials and residents echoed fears for single-family homeowners and suburban 'character.' In contrast, Borough President Donovan Richards's spokesperson and some residents supported the reforms, citing the city's affordability crisis. The majority of public testimony favored the proposal, but entrenched opposition from Queens officials remains strong.
