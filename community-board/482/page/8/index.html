Two sedans struck them. Both died. That was November. Six months later, a motorcyclist burned on the same boulevard after a driver chased him down and ran him over. The bike caught fire. The man died. The driver kept going. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/driver-charged-murder-deadly-nyc-road-rage-crash-da-says>&ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes,&rdquo; said District Attorney Melinda Katz</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>two people died and 114 were injured</strong> in crashes in Queens CB82. Not one was marked as a serious injury, but the dead do not heal. The numbers do not stop.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>Four people have died since 2022.</strong> Two were pedestrians, both killed by cars. One was a motorcyclist. The last was a driver. <strong>275 people have been hurt</strong>. Two suffered serious injuries. Most were young. Some were old. Five children were injured in the last year alone.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed two people. Motorcycles killed one.</strong> No one died on a bike. But every crash leaves someone broken.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But the limit on Woodhaven Boulevard is still 30. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The city has not lowered the speed limit here. The council has not demanded it. The mayor has not acted. The dead wait for action.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the limit stays high, every day the cameras go dark, another family risks losing someone.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Holden, it amends city code to require community notification for any bus lane, busway, or bike lane project, no matter the size. The bill states: 'construction or removal of a bus lane, busway, or bike lane' counts as a major project. DOT must present plans to affected boards, who get sixty days to comment. DOT must post quarterly updates online. Ariola is the primary sponsor; Holden co-sponsors. The bill aims to increase transparency and community input on street changes that shape safety for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola, joined by sixteen co-sponsors, pushes for at least 25 step streets to be lit each year until all are covered. Step streets are open-air staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to strip darkness from these paths, making them safer for people on foot.

The bills are not yet law and have not advanced through committee. Rajkumar, a close ally of Mayor Adams, claims e-bikes are a 'singular threat' and a 'safety hazard,' citing injury numbers that city data does not support. She stated, 'We have to get rid of the e-bike problem.' Despite her focus on e-bikes, a car used by Rajkumar’s office received 10 school-zone speeding tickets in under a year. Her spokesperson denied she drives the car, later confirmed to belong to her chief of staff. Rajkumar declined further comment. The push for e-bike regulation comes as cars continue to inflict the greatest harm on New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The mayor called both topics 'off topic' at a press conference. City Hall later said it is reviewing the Rajkumar bill and that the Department of Transportation would oversee the battery swap program, but provided no timeline. The bill, based on disputed injury statistics, has drawn criticism from street safety advocates who argue registration would suppress cycling and sustainable transit. Local Law 131, sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers, requires the battery swap program, but the city has not acted. Powers voiced frustration, noting the Council plans to allocate $3 million for the program.
