It records.</p><p>Two seniors died on Woodhaven Boulevard. A driver going straight hit them both, southbound, not at an intersection. The record lists a 71‑year‑old woman and a 73‑year‑old man. Both died at the scene. The cars kept going south. The case sits in the ledger as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4680207</a>. Two sedans. Two pedestrians. Two deaths.</p><p>On the parkway, the metal toll keeps coming. A 28‑year‑old motorcyclist was killed eastbound on the Jackie Robinson. Changing lanes is the last note before impact. It’s logged as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4752246</a>. Another rider died at 83‑35 Woodhaven Boulevard. A 23‑year‑old woman. The record says the motorcycle hit her in the crosswalk at night. It’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4808010</a>.</p><p>The clock on this map runs hot after dark. Injuries crest at 7 p.m. and again at the 4 p.m. rush, but the bodies pile up late. One death hits at 2 a.m., one at 10 a.m., and two more at 8 p.m., per the city’s counts.</p><p>Woodhaven and the parkway are the killing fields. Since 2022, the Jackie Robinson shows 238 injuries and one death in this board, the worst hotspot by far. Woodhaven shows two deaths and eight injuries. Both are flagged in the city data.</p><p>“Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers,” the Queens DA said of a wrong‑way rampage on the Clearview Expressway across the borough line. He later told police he entered the highway “in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people.” The courts gave him eight years. The quotes are on the record in <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>. Different road. Same city.</p><p>Speed is a quiet undertow in these files. The Woodhaven pedestrian deaths list straight‑line travel. The parkway logs are full of rear‑ends and lane changes. In this board since 2022: four deaths, 316 injuries. Pedestrians account for three deaths and 12 injuries. Occupants bear the bulk of the hurt. The pattern is not subtle.</p><p>Night after night, the numbers come back. Repeat hotspots. Repeat harm.</p><h3 id=woodhaven-takes-lives>Woodhaven takes lives</h3><p>Two pedestrians dead, southbound traffic, off the crosswalk. It’s all there in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4680207</a>. A Toyota sedan, New Jersey plates. A BMW sedan behind it. Center front damage. The city marks Woodhaven as a top location.</p><p>This board shows pedestrians killed more than cyclists. Three pedestrian deaths. Zero cyclist deaths. People on foot have thin margins here.</p><h3 id=the-parkway-grinds-people-up>The parkway grinds people up</h3><p>Jackie Robinson Parkway is the board’s worst corridor by injuries: 238 injured and one death since 2022. The logs show chain crashes, rear‑ends, and lane changes, like the fatal motorcycle collision in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4752246</a>. Another multi‑car crash on August 4, 2022 put a driver in the hospital with severe burns, recorded as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4552460</a>.</p><p>The time of day matters. Deaths concentrate at night around 2 a.m. and 8 p.m. Injuries spike again near the evening rush.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-body>What would stop the next body?</h3><p>Start where people are dying:</p><ul><li>On Woodhaven and Forest Park Drive, cut turns and visibility hazards with daylighting and hardened corners. Add leading intervals. These are standard tools the city uses.</li><li>On Jackie Robinson Parkway, target the recurring rear‑ends and lane‑change crashes with speed management and consistent enforcement at the known bends and merges.</li><li>Hit the repeat hotspots at night. The board’s own data points to evening and late‑night patterns.</li></ul><p>Citywide, the fix is bigger than one board. Albany passed the tools to slow cars and rein in repeat offenders. The Senate advanced a bill to force chronic violators to install speed limiters; Senator Addabbo voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> on June 11 and 12, 2025. In the Assembly, Andrew Hevesi co‑sponsored matching bills in <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">2023</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">2025</a>.</p><p>Albany also renewed round‑the‑clock school‑zone cameras through 2030, according to contemporaneous coverage. Locally, the council has a mixed record: Council Member Joann Ariola voted against expanding speed cameras in 2022, as documented by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>Lower speeds save lives. Limit the worst drivers. Then the numbers fall.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and Albany to act. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Assemblymember Emily Gallagher leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, and others. The bill aims to force chronic speeders to slow down.

The measure, supported by Council Members Tiffany Caban and Shahana Hanif, aims to 'greenlight pedestrians to freely cross streets outside the crosswalk or without obeying traffic signals.' The bill responds to claims of biased enforcement against Black and Latino New Yorkers. Council Majority Leader Joseph Borelli and Councilwoman Joann Ariola oppose the bill, warning it could endanger pedestrians. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or received a hearing. The NYPD and Mayor's office are reviewing the legislation. The debate highlights the tension between enforcement fairness and the ongoing risk to vulnerable road users.

Connections to the ferry and boardwalk improved.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2023, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) marked the completion of a major infrastructure project in Rockaway. The work, running from Beach Channel Drive to Shore Front Parkway, added porous pavement, new bike lanes, and wider pedestrian walkways. The city says the 11,000 square feet of new surface can absorb nearly 1.3 million gallons of stormwater each year. Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes. The changes give cyclists and pedestrians an easier, safer route to the Rockaway ferry terminal and boardwalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.

Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted.

The city’s future hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>The congestion pricing debate centers on a policy to toll drivers entering Manhattan’s core. The bill faces opposition from Council Members David Weprin, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan, who argue it will hurt small businesses and outer-borough residents. On May 22, 2023, Ari Kagan said, 'Congestion Pricing will hurt countless New Yorkers, small businesses, residents of so-called outer-boroughs & will create huge lines of parked cars right outside of Manhattan.' Yet, the MTA’s assessment shows only 5,200 city drivers commute by car from areas far from fast transit—just 1.2% of that population. Advocates like Felicia Park-Rogers counter, 'this policy has the potential to be utterly transformational for our city.' The plan includes exemptions for disabled and low-income drivers.
