Two sedans struck them. Both died. That was November. Six months later, a motorcyclist burned on the same boulevard after a driver chased him down and ran him over. The bike caught fire. The man died. The driver kept going. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/driver-charged-murder-deadly-nyc-road-rage-crash-da-says>&ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes,&rdquo; said District Attorney Melinda Katz</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>two people died and 114 were injured</strong> in crashes in Queens CB82. Not one was marked as a serious injury, but the dead do not heal. The numbers do not stop.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>Four people have died since 2022.</strong> Two were pedestrians, both killed by cars. One was a motorcyclist. The last was a driver. <strong>275 people have been hurt</strong>. Two suffered serious injuries. Most were young. Some were old. Five children were injured in the last year alone.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed two people. Motorcycles killed one.</strong> No one died on a bike. But every crash leaves someone broken.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But the limit on Woodhaven Boulevard is still 30. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The city has not lowered the speed limit here. The council has not demanded it. The mayor has not acted. The dead wait for action.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the limit stays high, every day the cameras go dark, another family risks losing someone.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras.

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with advocates demanding stronger protections for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision occurred as the motorcycle, traveling east, was struck head-on during a lane change. The report states the rider was ejected and suffered crush injuries to his entire body, resulting in death. The police narrative describes the impact as sudden and violent: 'A lane change ended him. The road stayed still. His body did not.' The contributing factor listed in the police report is 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion,' with no specific driver error cited for the other vehicle. The report notes the motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the description of the crash mechanics and contributing factors. The focus remains on the deadly consequences of a lane change on a high-speed parkway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Her own car racks up 10 school-zone speeding tickets. She calls e-bikes a menace, but city data shows cars injure far more. Vulnerable road users face danger from both policy and reckless driving.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar introduced bills A9092 and A9114, aiming to require e-bike registration, insurance, and inspections. The bills are not yet law and have not advanced through committee. Rajkumar, a close ally of Mayor Adams, claims e-bikes are a 'singular threat' and a 'safety hazard,' citing injury numbers that city data does not support. She stated, 'We have to get rid of the e-bike problem.' Despite her focus on e-bikes, a car used by Rajkumar’s office received 10 school-zone speeding tickets in under a year. Her spokesperson denied she drives the car, later confirmed to belong to her chief of staff. Rajkumar declined further comment. The push for e-bike regulation comes as cars continue to inflict the greatest harm on New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The mayor backs a park. Advocates demand transit. Poor residents lose out. Elected officials split. The city risks locking out thousands from jobs and care. The debate rages. No one asks the people.</p><p class=mb3>This op-ed, published April 4, 2024, covers the battle over the unused Rockaway Beach Branch rail line in southeastern Queens. The city, led by Mayor Adams, pushes a park-only project, funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director, argues the plan blocks a vital north-south rail corridor, denying disadvantaged communities access to jobs, education, and healthcare. The op-ed states: 'It is simply irresponsible to build a park on a viable transit right-of-way in the biggest city in America.' State Senators James Sanders, Jr. and Joe Addabbo, Assembly Member Stacey Amato, and Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, JoAnn Ariola, and Bob Holden support studies and funding for the rails-and-trails QueensLink alternative. The mayor’s plan faces criticism for ignoring public input and environmental justice. No safety impact assessment for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
