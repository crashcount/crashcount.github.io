It records.</p><p>Two seniors died on Woodhaven Boulevard. A driver going straight hit them both, southbound, not at an intersection. The record lists a 71‑year‑old woman and a 73‑year‑old man. Both died at the scene. The cars kept going south. The case sits in the ledger as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4680207</a>. Two sedans. Two pedestrians. Two deaths.</p><p>On the parkway, the metal toll keeps coming. A 28‑year‑old motorcyclist was killed eastbound on the Jackie Robinson. Changing lanes is the last note before impact. It’s logged as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4752246</a>. Another rider died at 83‑35 Woodhaven Boulevard. A 23‑year‑old woman. The record says the motorcycle hit her in the crosswalk at night. It’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4808010</a>.</p><p>The clock on this map runs hot after dark. Injuries crest at 7 p.m. and again at the 4 p.m. rush, but the bodies pile up late. One death hits at 2 a.m., one at 10 a.m., and two more at 8 p.m., per the city’s counts.</p><p>Woodhaven and the parkway are the killing fields. Since 2022, the Jackie Robinson shows 238 injuries and one death in this board, the worst hotspot by far. Woodhaven shows two deaths and eight injuries. Both are flagged in the city data.</p><p>“Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers,” the Queens DA said of a wrong‑way rampage on the Clearview Expressway across the borough line. He later told police he entered the highway “in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people.” The courts gave him eight years. The quotes are on the record in <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>. Different road. Same city.</p><p>Speed is a quiet undertow in these files. The Woodhaven pedestrian deaths list straight‑line travel. The parkway logs are full of rear‑ends and lane changes. In this board since 2022: four deaths, 316 injuries. Pedestrians account for three deaths and 12 injuries. Occupants bear the bulk of the hurt. The pattern is not subtle.</p><p>Night after night, the numbers come back. Repeat hotspots. Repeat harm.</p><h3 id=woodhaven-takes-lives>Woodhaven takes lives</h3><p>Two pedestrians dead, southbound traffic, off the crosswalk. It’s all there in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4680207</a>. A Toyota sedan, New Jersey plates. A BMW sedan behind it. Center front damage. The city marks Woodhaven as a top location.</p><p>This board shows pedestrians killed more than cyclists. Three pedestrian deaths. Zero cyclist deaths. People on foot have thin margins here.</p><h3 id=the-parkway-grinds-people-up>The parkway grinds people up</h3><p>Jackie Robinson Parkway is the board’s worst corridor by injuries: 238 injured and one death since 2022. The logs show chain crashes, rear‑ends, and lane changes, like the fatal motorcycle collision in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4752246</a>. Another multi‑car crash on August 4, 2022 put a driver in the hospital with severe burns, recorded as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4552460</a>.</p><p>The time of day matters. Deaths concentrate at night around 2 a.m. and 8 p.m. Injuries spike again near the evening rush.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-body>What would stop the next body?</h3><p>Start where people are dying:</p><ul><li>On Woodhaven and Forest Park Drive, cut turns and visibility hazards with daylighting and hardened corners. Add leading intervals. These are standard tools the city uses.</li><li>On Jackie Robinson Parkway, target the recurring rear‑ends and lane‑change crashes with speed management and consistent enforcement at the known bends and merges.</li><li>Hit the repeat hotspots at night. The board’s own data points to evening and late‑night patterns.</li></ul><p>Citywide, the fix is bigger than one board. Albany passed the tools to slow cars and rein in repeat offenders. The Senate advanced a bill to force chronic violators to install speed limiters; Senator Addabbo voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> on June 11 and 12, 2025. In the Assembly, Andrew Hevesi co‑sponsored matching bills in <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">2023</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">2025</a>.</p><p>Albany also renewed round‑the‑clock school‑zone cameras through 2030, according to contemporaneous coverage. Locally, the council has a mixed record: Council Member Joann Ariola voted against expanding speed cameras in 2022, as documented by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>Lower speeds save lives. Limit the worst drivers. Then the numbers fall.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and Albany to act.

Prosecutors said Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and driving 83 mph in a 25 mph zone when he ran a red light and struck Diaz’s BMW. Surveillance footage showed the Mercedes 'barreled through an East Elmhurst intersection' at 4:15 a.m. Diaz, headed to work at LaGuardia, died at the scene. Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail. The article highlights family grief and outrage at bail laws, quoting Diaz’s brother: 'Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail... Justin will never walk the streets again.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Her bill would hike fines to $1,000 and let New Yorkers send 311 videos for instant tickets. Blocked hydrants delayed response to deadly fires. Streets stay dangerous. Lives lost.</p><p class=mb3>On February 17, 2025, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) announced draft legislation to crack down on drivers who block fire hydrants. The bill, not yet numbered, would raise fines from $115 to $1,000 and allow 311 video submissions for automatic summonses. Ariola said, 'We have seen two fires in the past week that have resulted in fatalities where the firefighters were unable to access the closest fire hydrant.' The measure responds to a surge in complaints—over 134,000 in 2023—about blocked hydrants. Ariola’s office blamed lost parking to DOT bike lanes and racks, but the DOT countered, calling protected bike lanes a proven safety tool. FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker said blocked hydrants slowed firefighting in a recent fatal fire. The bill aims to keep hydrants clear and prevent more deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The white Toyota sedan hit an underpass near 225th Street around 3:50 a.m. Both occupants were found outside the wreck when police arrived. Investigators are unsure who was driving at the time of impact: 'Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven't figured out who was driving, police said.' The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive. The article highlights ongoing uncertainty about driver identity and underscores the persistent risks on city highways, especially where loss of vehicle control leads to deadly outcomes.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians.
