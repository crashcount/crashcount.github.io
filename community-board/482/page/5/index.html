Two sedans struck them. Both died. That was November. Six months later, a motorcyclist burned on the same boulevard after a driver chased him down and ran him over. The bike caught fire. The man died. The driver kept going. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/driver-charged-murder-deadly-nyc-road-rage-crash-da-says>&ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes,&rdquo; said District Attorney Melinda Katz</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>two people died and 114 were injured</strong> in crashes in Queens CB82. Not one was marked as a serious injury, but the dead do not heal. The numbers do not stop.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>Four people have died since 2022.</strong> Two were pedestrians, both killed by cars. One was a motorcyclist. The last was a driver. <strong>275 people have been hurt</strong>. Two suffered serious injuries. Most were young. Some were old. Five children were injured in the last year alone.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed two people. Motorcycles killed one.</strong> No one died on a bike. But every crash leaves someone broken.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But the limit on Woodhaven Boulevard is still 30. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The city has not lowered the speed limit here. The council has not demanded it. The mayor has not acted. The dead wait for action.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the limit stays high, every day the cameras go dark, another family risks losing someone.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'MTA threatens another ‘Summer of Hell’ of subway disruptions if NYC doesn’t cough up billions,' drew sharp words. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Queens) blasted the agency: 'Instead of insulting us with baseless threats, the agency that spends $30 million on a staircase should find ways to cut its wasteful spending and bloated payroll before asking for more taxpayer money.' Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility.

Holden (District 30) joined Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar and advocates in Midtown to rally for Priscilla’s Law (A339). The bill would require all e-bikes to have license plates and be registered with the DMV or DOT. The rally, held near Governor Hochul’s office, drew support from the NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance. The matter title: 'New Yorkers rally in Midtown to combat “lawless” e-bike riding in NYC.' Holden supports both city and state versions, stating, 'We need the state DMV to issue license plates for e-bikes.' Rajkumar declared, 'We will usher in a new era free of e-bikes blasting through red lights.' The bill is named for Priscilla Loke, killed by an e-bike in 2023. Advocates say e-bike collisions often end in hit-and-runs.
