Two sedans struck them. Both died. That was November. Six months later, a motorcyclist burned on the same boulevard after a driver chased him down and ran him over. The bike caught fire. The man died. The driver kept going. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/driver-charged-murder-deadly-nyc-road-rage-crash-da-says>&ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes,&rdquo; said District Attorney Melinda Katz</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>two people died and 114 were injured</strong> in crashes in Queens CB82. Not one was marked as a serious injury, but the dead do not heal. The numbers do not stop.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>Four people have died since 2022.</strong> Two were pedestrians, both killed by cars. One was a motorcyclist. The last was a driver. <strong>275 people have been hurt</strong>. Two suffered serious injuries. Most were young. Some were old. Five children were injured in the last year alone.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed two people. Motorcycles killed one.</strong> No one died on a bike. But every crash leaves someone broken.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But the limit on Woodhaven Boulevard is still 30. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The city has not lowered the speed limit here. The council has not demanded it. The mayor has not acted. The dead wait for action.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the limit stays high, every day the cameras go dark, another family risks losing someone.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Debate continues over transit versus parkland.</p><p class=mb3>On November 28, 2022, Council Members Joann Ariola and Selvena Brooks-Powers introduced a City Council resolution urging the MTA to conduct an environmental impact study for the QueensLink rail reactivation. The bill, non-binding and currently under committee review, seeks to revive 3.5 miles of the former Rockaway Beach Branch, extending the M train from Rego Park to the Rockaways. The matter title calls for 'a deeper study of the QueensLink proposal to reactivate an old rail line.' Ariola and Brooks-Powers, both representing southeastern Queens, argue the project would benefit communities with poor subway access and reduce car dependency. Ariola stated, 'I think it’s necessary and I think that it would really benefit the communities.' Brooks-Powers emphasized the resolution as a priority for the Transportation Committee. The push comes as Mayor Adams advances the QueensWay park plan, raising concerns among transit advocates. The MTA says a new study is unnecessary, but supporters insist a thorough review is needed before converting the corridor to parkland.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The FDNY expressed concern about resource demands for detailed annual fire reporting. The matter summary states the bills aim to address the rise of deadly fires from faulty batteries, often used by delivery workers. Council Member Joann Ariola urged the FDNY to consider international solutions and invest in safe charging infrastructure. Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas Unidos opposed the bans, arguing they punish low-income workers and miss root causes. The city recently abandoned a proposal to ban e-bikes on NYCHA property and is working on new charging stations.

Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) argued that open street programs, bike lanes, and traffic islands hinder emergency vehicles, especially when illegal parking blocks access. She called for better enforcement. Other voices, including union leaders, echoed her concerns. However, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan defended new street designs, stating they were built with emergency input.

The fight pits open space against transit justice in Queens.</p><p class=mb3>On September 16, 2022, Mayor Adams announced the start of the QueensWay project, a $35 million plan to turn a defunct LIRR branch in Queens into a linear park. The first phase includes $5 million for environmental review and $30 million for the Metropolitan Hub. The matter summary states: 'converting a defunct LIRR branch into a Highline-style park in Queens.' Council Member Lynn Schulman supports the park, calling it 'shovel-ready.' Borough President Donovan Richards and Assembly Members Jenifer Rajkumar and David Weprin back both the park and the QueensLink transit proposal. Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation. The debate continues over whether the right-of-way should serve parks, transit, or both.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Joann Ariola opposes the plan, claiming it will worsen city travel. Delays threaten $1 billion in MTA funding. Vulnerable road users wait as traffic and pollution persist. No relief in sight.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2022, Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) joined critics in a policy debate over New York City's stalled congestion pricing plan. The measure, approved by state lawmakers three years ago, would charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The MTA faces hundreds of follow-up questions from the Federal Highway Administration, delaying the required environmental assessment. Ariola argued, 'I don’t believe it will work, in fact I believe it will make the city more unmanageable to travel through.' The plan is intended to reduce traffic, lower car pollution, and fund MTA capital improvements. Delays put $1 billion in annual funding at risk, threatening upgrades like accessible subway stations and zero-emission buses. As the debate drags on, vulnerable road users remain exposed to traffic and pollution hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
