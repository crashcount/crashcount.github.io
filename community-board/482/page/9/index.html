It records.</p><p>Two seniors died on Woodhaven Boulevard. A driver going straight hit them both, southbound, not at an intersection. The record lists a 71‑year‑old woman and a 73‑year‑old man. Both died at the scene. The cars kept going south. The case sits in the ledger as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4680207</a>. Two sedans. Two pedestrians. Two deaths.</p><p>On the parkway, the metal toll keeps coming. A 28‑year‑old motorcyclist was killed eastbound on the Jackie Robinson. Changing lanes is the last note before impact. It’s logged as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4752246</a>. Another rider died at 83‑35 Woodhaven Boulevard. A 23‑year‑old woman. The record says the motorcycle hit her in the crosswalk at night. It’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4808010</a>.</p><p>The clock on this map runs hot after dark. Injuries crest at 7 p.m. and again at the 4 p.m. rush, but the bodies pile up late. One death hits at 2 a.m., one at 10 a.m., and two more at 8 p.m., per the city’s counts.</p><p>Woodhaven and the parkway are the killing fields. Since 2022, the Jackie Robinson shows 238 injuries and one death in this board, the worst hotspot by far. Woodhaven shows two deaths and eight injuries. Both are flagged in the city data.</p><p>“Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers,” the Queens DA said of a wrong‑way rampage on the Clearview Expressway across the borough line. He later told police he entered the highway “in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people.” The courts gave him eight years. The quotes are on the record in <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>. Different road. Same city.</p><p>Speed is a quiet undertow in these files. The Woodhaven pedestrian deaths list straight‑line travel. The parkway logs are full of rear‑ends and lane changes. In this board since 2022: four deaths, 316 injuries. Pedestrians account for three deaths and 12 injuries. Occupants bear the bulk of the hurt. The pattern is not subtle.</p><p>Night after night, the numbers come back. Repeat hotspots. Repeat harm.</p><h3 id=woodhaven-takes-lives>Woodhaven takes lives</h3><p>Two pedestrians dead, southbound traffic, off the crosswalk. It’s all there in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4680207</a>. A Toyota sedan, New Jersey plates. A BMW sedan behind it. Center front damage. The city marks Woodhaven as a top location.</p><p>This board shows pedestrians killed more than cyclists. Three pedestrian deaths. Zero cyclist deaths. People on foot have thin margins here.</p><h3 id=the-parkway-grinds-people-up>The parkway grinds people up</h3><p>Jackie Robinson Parkway is the board’s worst corridor by injuries: 238 injured and one death since 2022. The logs show chain crashes, rear‑ends, and lane changes, like the fatal motorcycle collision in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4752246</a>. Another multi‑car crash on August 4, 2022 put a driver in the hospital with severe burns, recorded as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4552460</a>.</p><p>The time of day matters.

The move aims to connect southeast Queens, cut car trips, and open new routes. The bill signals urgency but lacks binding power. Debate continues over transit versus parkland.</p><p class=mb3>On November 28, 2022, Council Members Joann Ariola and Selvena Brooks-Powers introduced a City Council resolution urging the MTA to conduct an environmental impact study for the QueensLink rail reactivation. The bill, non-binding and currently under committee review, seeks to revive 3.5 miles of the former Rockaway Beach Branch, extending the M train from Rego Park to the Rockaways. The matter title calls for 'a deeper study of the QueensLink proposal to reactivate an old rail line.' Ariola and Brooks-Powers, both representing southeastern Queens, argue the project would benefit communities with poor subway access and reduce car dependency. Ariola stated, 'I think it’s necessary and I think that it would really benefit the communities.' Brooks-Powers emphasized the resolution as a priority for the Transportation Committee. The push comes as Mayor Adams advances the QueensWay park plan, raising concerns among transit advocates. The MTA says a new study is unnecessary, but supporters insist a thorough review is needed before converting the corridor to parkland.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The FDNY supported four out of five bills, including bans on second-use and non-certified batteries, a public safety campaign, and safety information for delivery workers. The FDNY expressed concern about resource demands for detailed annual fire reporting. The matter summary states the bills aim to address the rise of deadly fires from faulty batteries, often used by delivery workers. Council Member Joann Ariola urged the FDNY to consider international solutions and invest in safe charging infrastructure. Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas Unidos opposed the bans, arguing they punish low-income workers and miss root causes. The city recently abandoned a proposal to ban e-bikes on NYCHA property and is working on new charging stations.

Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) argued that open street programs, bike lanes, and traffic islands hinder emergency vehicles, especially when illegal parking blocks access. She called for better enforcement. Other voices, including union leaders, echoed her concerns. However, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan defended new street designs, stating they were built with emergency input.

The fight pits open space against transit justice in Queens.</p><p class=mb3>On September 16, 2022, Mayor Adams announced the start of the QueensWay project, a $35 million plan to turn a defunct LIRR branch in Queens into a linear park. The first phase includes $5 million for environmental review and $30 million for the Metropolitan Hub. The matter summary states: 'converting a defunct LIRR branch into a Highline-style park in Queens.' Council Member Lynn Schulman supports the park, calling it 'shovel-ready.' Borough President Donovan Richards and Assembly Members Jenifer Rajkumar and David Weprin back both the park and the QueensLink transit proposal. Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation. The debate continues over whether the right-of-way should serve parks, transit, or both.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA faces hundreds of follow-up questions from the Federal Highway Administration, delaying the required environmental assessment. Ariola argued, 'I don’t believe it will work, in fact I believe it will make the city more unmanageable to travel through.' The plan is intended to reduce traffic, lower car pollution, and fund MTA capital improvements. Delays put $1 billion in annual funding at risk, threatening upgrades like accessible subway stations and zero-emission buses.
