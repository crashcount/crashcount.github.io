The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But the limit on Woodhaven Boulevard is still 30. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. The city has not lowered the speed limit here. The council has not demanded it. The mayor has not acted. The dead wait for action.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the limit stays high, every day the cameras go dark, another family risks losing someone.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Metal collides with flesh. A young woman, twenty-three, falls broken in the night. The street runs red. She dies there, as the city sleeps, struck down by speed and disregard.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a fatal crash occurred on Woodhaven Boulevard near 83rd Street in Queens at 2:20 a.m. A motorcycle, traveling north, 'barrels fast, ignoring the light.' The report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors for the driver. The motorcycle struck a 23-year-old woman crossing at the intersection. The report states she was 'crossing against the signal,' but the focus remains on the driver's actions: running the light and speeding. The impact was severe, with the victim suffering fatal injuries to her entire body. The police narrative describes the scene: 'Metal strikes flesh. The street runs red. She dies there, whole body broken, as the city sleeps.' Driver error—disregard for traffic control and unsafe speed—stands at the center of this tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
