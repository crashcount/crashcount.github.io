Forty-one left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In Queens CB10, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, the streets have claimed lives and broken bodies. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry the weight. In the last year alone, two more people died. Four were seriously hurt. The pain is not spread evenly. It falls hardest on those outside the car—walkers, cyclists, children.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a BMW vaulted the median on the Belt Parkway and slammed into oncoming cars. Six people were hurt, three left fighting for life.</strong> Police closed the road. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad came to count the damage. &ldquo;It was unclear what caused the driver to lose control but police said speed may have been an issue,&rdquo; the <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>Post reported</a>. The cause is always the same: speed, steel, and the city’s refusal to change.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm.</strong> They killed three. They left hundreds with broken bones and worse. Trucks and buses took another life. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one more. Bikes injured two. The street is a battleground, but only some are armed.</p><p>The stories repeat. A woman crossing the street, struck by a bus. A child hit by a turning car. A moped rider ejected and left dead on the expressway. The names change. The grief does not.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have voted both ways.</strong> Council Member Joann Ariola voted against legalizing jaywalking, a law that would have shifted blame away from pedestrians and toward drivers. She also voted no on daylighting, a proven fix that clears sightlines at corners. But she has backed bills for better lighting and safer truck routes. The record is mixed. The results are not. &ldquo;Our leaders are failing New Yorkers,&rdquo; <a href="https://transalt.org/press-releases/new-york-city-experiences-deadliest-first-six-months-in-vision-zero-history-new-analysis-from-transportation-alternatives-and-families-for-safe-streets-shows#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20leaders%20are%20failing%20New,risk%20by%20turning%20a%20blind">said Transportation Alternatives</a>.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph.

Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the corridor suffers from 'an inconsistent, patchwork design' and blocked lanes. Buses crawl at four miles per hour due to congestion. Only a third of road space serves buses, though 83% of transit users ride them. The project adds camera-enforced bus lanes, parking, and loading zones. Policy shifts road space from private cars to public transit, aiming to speed up service for 215,000 daily riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.'

The driver, Bekim Fiseku, was wanted for burglary and had tape over his license plate. Police chased him nearly a mile through residential streets. A witness said, "She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force." The article highlights concerns about NYPD's pursuit tactics, quoting the victim's father: "It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood." Fiseku faces murder and manslaughter charges.
