Eight people were hurt. The driver told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb at the bus stop&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>). After reviewing video, officials now believe he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. The sidewalk is not safe. The bus stop is not safe. The city keeps moving.</p><h2 id=who-acts-who-waits>Who Acts, Who Waits</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to slow the carnage.</strong> State Senator James Sanders voted yes to require speed-limiting devices for repeat dangerous drivers—an effort to &ldquo;create safer streets for all New Yorkers&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). But not all stand with the vulnerable. Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato voted no on extending school speed zones, opposing a measure that would have protected children (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p><strong>Most deaths here come from cars and SUVs.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, and trucks have killed and maimed the most. Buses and motorcycles add to the toll. The sidewalk is no refuge. The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them: Slow the cars. Protect the people.

A 33-year-old male rear passenger suffered a head injury. A 27-year-old male driver sustained severe leg lacerations. According to the police report, the contributing factor was “Unsafe Speed.” That driver error sits at the center of this crash. No other contributing factors were listed for the drivers or passengers. The road’s wide, fast design leaves little margin when drivers barrel ahead.

DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city."
