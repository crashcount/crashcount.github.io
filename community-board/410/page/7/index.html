In Queens CB10, the numbers are blunt. <strong>Thirteen people dead. Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,700 hurt since 2022. Each number is a life changed or ended. Each crash is a story that does not end well.</p><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway. The car hit the divider, flew into oncoming traffic, and caught fire. <strong>No one inside wore a seat belt.</strong> Two young lives ended. Others crawled from the wreckage, dazed and bleeding. A survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;They went airborne and into the barrier.&rdquo; The horror did not stop at the crash. Families are left with the memory of bodies thrown from the car, and a fire that would not go out.</p><p>A few days before, a 76-year-old woman died in a Queens pizzeria. An e-bike battery exploded outside the bathroom. The fire moved fast. The FDNY <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/us-news/grandma-76-killed-when-e-bike-battery-explodes-like-blowtorch-inside-nyc-pizzeria-on-fourth-of-july-fdny/>called it a &ldquo;blowtorch effect.&rdquo;</a> She could not escape. Her son found her burned, almost beyond recognition. &ldquo;For me to find my mom burnt like a roast pig&mldr; is a memory I cannot forget.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>Crashes are not random.</strong> In the last year, six people died here. Seventeen suffered serious injuries. The wounded are young and old—children, parents, elders. Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. Trucks, motorcycles, buses, and even bikes left their mark. The Belt Parkway, Lefferts Boulevard, and 149th Avenue are not safe for anyone outside a car.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h3><p>Some bills have passed. Council Member Joann Ariola voted for step street lighting and truck route redesigns. She co-sponsored bills for raised speed reducers and pedestrian lighting. But she also voted <strong>against daylighting intersections</strong> and <strong>against legalizing jaywalking</strong>—measures proven to protect people on foot. She opposed congestion pricing, which would have meant fewer cars and safer streets. She even voted against expanding speed cameras, despite her own car racking up <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>27 school-zone speeding tickets</a>.</p><p><strong>The silence is deadly.</strong> Every delay, every vote against proven safety, means another family gets the call no one wants.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-now>What You Can Do Now</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org/>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org/>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Do not wait for the next siren. The next body. The next headline.</p><p><strong>The road will not change itself. You must.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Critics say it slows life-saving street redesigns. Advocates warn it props up car culture and blocks safer bike lanes. The bill risks more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 103, now before the City Council, would require the Department of Transportation to notify Council members every time a single parking spot is repurposed—for car-share, bike corrals, or Citi Bike docks. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The SUV driver, a 22-year-old male with a permit license, was following too closely and struck the sedan's center back end as it was slowing or stopping. The sedan driver, a 26-year-old female licensed driver, was also slowing or stopping but had to react to an uninvolved vehicle, contributing to the collision. Both drivers were injured: the SUV driver suffered back injuries and whiplash, while the sedan driver sustained contusions to the knee and lower leg. Neither occupant was ejected, and both remained conscious.
