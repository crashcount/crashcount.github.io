They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. But in Queens CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No local leader here has stood up with a plan that matches the scale of the blood on the street.</strong> The laws that matter—like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits—are on the books. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first, not cars.

The report states the pickup did not stop after the collision—'No brake lights. Just gone.' The vehicle, registered in New Jersey, showed no reported damage and was traveling west.

The agency used powers from Sammy's Law, passed last year, to lower speeds in DUMBO (Brooklyn), City Island (Bronx), Broad Channel (Queens), and New Brighton (Staten Island). DOT chose these areas for their heavy pedestrian traffic and clear boundaries. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing DUMBO, praised the move, saying, "I'm pleased that DOT will be implementing Brooklyn's first Regional Slow Zone in DUMBO—a neighborhood densely crowded with pedestrian foot traffic." DOT plans to cut speeds on 250 street segments this year, focusing on schools and shared streets. Research shows lower speed limits reduce injury severity in crashes. Despite this progress, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not brought a citywide 20 mph limit to a vote.

The MTA demanded $4 billion from the city—a 33% jump from the last plan—warning of major subway disruptions if denied. The matter, titled 'MTA threatens another ‘Summer of Hell’ of subway disruptions if NYC doesn’t cough up billions,' drew sharp words. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Queens) blasted the agency: 'Instead of insulting us with baseless threats, the agency that spends $30 million on a staircase should find ways to cut its wasteful spending and bloated payroll before asking for more taxpayer money.' Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility. Despite heated criticism, council members did not strongly oppose the request in session. The hearing left the city’s most vulnerable riders—those who rely on safe, reliable transit—caught between political fights and crumbling infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics call it a failure.</p><p class=mb3>Bill passed by the City Council and signed by Mayor Adams in 2023 slashes the number of restaurants allowed curbside dining to just 600, down 81 percent from the pandemic peak. The legislation, championed by Council Speaker and mayoral candidate Adrienne Adams, bans winter roadway dining, adds yearly fees, and requires public hearings for each curbside setup. The matter summary states, 'outdoor dining, in my perspective, should be sidewalk,' and that 'street extensions ... were designed to be temporary.' Local Council members and community boards now have more power to delay or deny permits. Adams led the push, with DOT officials claiming the new program is still larger than pre-Covid, but restaurateurs and advocates like Sara Lind and Majora Carter call the process burdensome and exclusionary. Small businesses and vulnerable road users lose public space as curbside dining shrinks and car storage returns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They warned, 'The limited funding and decreases in funding that have occurred over the years jeopardize the continuity and future of the program—funding pressure is already leading to downsizing and the disappearance of Open Streets programs.' The groups seek $48 million over three years, separate from the city’s $30 million contract with the Horticultural Society. Current grants max out at $20,000 per year, forcing cutbacks. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams are starting budget talks. Council spokesperson Julia Agos called Open Streets 'critical components of our city's public realm.'

Adams has supported e-bike registration, which experts warn would harm delivery workers and street safety. She has not acted to hold reckless drivers accountable after the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and has not used Council powers to lower speed limits. Adams oversaw an outdoor dining law that restricted the program, leading to fewer participating restaurants. She has not enforced the Streets Master Plan benchmarks or sued the mayor for noncompliance.

Lives lost.</p><p class=mb3>On February 17, 2025, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) announced draft legislation to crack down on drivers who block fire hydrants. The bill, not yet numbered, would raise fines from $115 to $1,000 and allow 311 video submissions for automatic summonses. Ariola said, 'We have seen two fires in the past week that have resulted in fatalities where the firefighters were unable to access the closest fire hydrant.' The measure responds to a surge in complaints—over 134,000 in 2023—about blocked hydrants. Ariola’s office blamed lost parking to DOT bike lanes and racks, but the DOT countered, calling protected bike lanes a proven safety tool. FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker said blocked hydrants slowed firefighting in a recent fatal fire. The bill aims to keep hydrants clear and prevent more deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
