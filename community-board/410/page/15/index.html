Forty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 3,000 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars the rest of us cannot see.</p><p>Just days ago, the Belt Parkway saw another crash. A BMW lost control, hit the median, went airborne, and caught fire. <strong>Two people died. Three more were hurt.</strong> The NYPD said, &ldquo;She later succumbed to her injuries and was pronounced dead&rdquo; (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/07/deadly-belt-parkway-crash-howard-beach/>amny</a>). The investigation is ongoing. The road stays open. The traffic moves on.</p><p>On 149th Avenue, a 25-year-old on a motorcycle was killed. The record says only this: &ldquo;Ejected. Apparent death.&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=buses-curbs-and-the-edge-of-disaster>Buses, Curbs, and the Edge of Disaster</h2><p>Last week, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb. Eight people were hurt. The driver told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb at the bus stop&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>). After reviewing video, officials now believe he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. The sidewalk is not safe. The bus stop is not safe. The city keeps moving.</p><h2 id=who-acts-who-waits>Who Acts, Who Waits</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to slow the carnage.</strong> State Senator James Sanders voted yes to require speed-limiting devices for repeat dangerous drivers—an effort to &ldquo;create safer streets for all New Yorkers&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). But not all stand with the vulnerable. Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato voted no on extending school speed zones, opposing a measure that would have protected children (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p><strong>Most deaths here come from cars and SUVs.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, and trucks have killed and maimed the most. Buses and motorcycles add to the toll. The sidewalk is no refuge. The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them: Slow the cars. Protect the people. Every day they wait, another life is at risk.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers balked at raising payroll taxes. The MTA’s $15 billion plan now hangs by a thread. Projects stall. Federal funds at risk. Riders, walkers, and cyclists face uncertainty. Albany remains split. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Governor Hochul announced a pause on congestion pricing, sparking confusion in Albany. The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged. Vulnerable road users are left exposed as transit funding falters.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian sustained a head injury and contusions, classified as injury severity level 3, and remained conscious after the impact. The point of impact was the center front end of the vehicle, which suffered damage in the same area. The report explicitly cites the driver's failure to yield right-of-way as a contributing factor, compounded by glare conditions. The pedestrian's crossing with the signal is noted but not listed as a contributing factor. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle eastbound with one occupant.
