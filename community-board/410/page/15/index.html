Forty-one left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In Queens CB10, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, the streets have claimed lives and broken bodies. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry the weight. In the last year alone, two more people died. Four were seriously hurt. The pain is not spread evenly. It falls hardest on those outside the car—walkers, cyclists, children.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a BMW vaulted the median on the Belt Parkway and slammed into oncoming cars. Six people were hurt, three left fighting for life.</strong> Police closed the road. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad came to count the damage. &ldquo;It was unclear what caused the driver to lose control but police said speed may have been an issue,&rdquo; the <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>Post reported</a>. The cause is always the same: speed, steel, and the city’s refusal to change.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm.</strong> They killed three. They left hundreds with broken bones and worse. Trucks and buses took another life. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one more. Bikes injured two. The street is a battleground, but only some are armed.</p><p>The stories repeat. A woman crossing the street, struck by a bus. A child hit by a turning car. A moped rider ejected and left dead on the expressway. The names change. The grief does not.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have voted both ways.</strong> Council Member Joann Ariola voted against legalizing jaywalking, a law that would have shifted blame away from pedestrians and toward drivers. She also voted no on daylighting, a proven fix that clears sightlines at corners. But she has backed bills for better lighting and safer truck routes. The record is mixed. The results are not. &ldquo;Our leaders are failing New Yorkers,&rdquo; <a href="https://transalt.org/press-releases/new-york-city-experiences-deadliest-first-six-months-in-vision-zero-history-new-analysis-from-transportation-alternatives-and-families-for-safe-streets-shows#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20leaders%20are%20failing%20New,risk%20by%20turning%20a%20blind">said Transportation Alternatives</a>.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph.

The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C. Riley (primary), with Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Hanif, Brewer, Restler, and Rivera as co-sponsors, the bill demands DOT report, by neighborhood, on safety infrastructure investment, crash rates, and demographics. It shines a light on which districts get safety upgrades and which are left exposed.

DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk.

Danger shifts from curbs.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0906-2023, now Local Law 142 of 2023, was enacted by the City Council on October 29, 2023, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill’s title: 'A Local Law in relation to parking for tractor trailers and other commercial trucks.' It requires the city to identify at least one feasible off-street parking location for tractor trailers in each borough by the end of 2023, and to establish those sites by December 31, 2025. No location can be on a residential street. Council Member Kamillah Hanks sponsored the bill, joined by Brannan, Riley, Dinowitz, Ung, Brooks-Powers, and others. The law aims to clear residential streets of oversized trucks, shifting their presence to designated lots. The council’s action targets the chronic hazard of trucks parked where people walk, bike, and live.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

James Sanders led the call, declaring, 'Yes, we want a park and yes we want a light rail. We can have both.' Mike Scala, another advocate, stressed public support for a combined approach. The QueensLink faces competition from the QueensWay, a park-only plan with $35 million in city funding. The MTA has not committed, citing high costs and ongoing needs assessment.
