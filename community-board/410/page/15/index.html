North Conduit Avenue tells its own story: <strong>2 deaths</strong> and <strong>255 injuries</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(NYC Open Data – locations)</a>.</p><p>The causes are plain in the files. A 23‑year‑old man walking was killed on 101 Street near 103 Avenue late on Jul 31; police cited unsafe speed by the driver of a 2021 sedan <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(case 4832080)</a>. Two days in August, police again wrote up failure to yield at a crosswalk on 109 Avenue and a driver following too closely at Rockaway Boulevard <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>(crash records)</a>.</p><p>This month, a 44‑year‑old woman directing traffic at a Nassau Expressway work site was run down and left to die; police later arrested a driver <a href=https://qns.com/2025/09/woman-killed-hit-and-run-van-wyck-expressway/>according to local reports</a>. “The safety of pedestrians and all street users remains a top priority,” City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams’ office said of a visibility bill now moving through the council <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-parking-spaces-council-bid-road-safety/>(AMNY)</a>.</p><h3 id=simple-fixes-delayed>Simple fixes, delayed</h3><p>On these corners, the work is basic: daylight every approach so drivers can see people at the crosswalks; give walkers a head start with leading pedestrian intervals; harden turns so drivers slow; put real night‑time enforcement where the deaths stack up; and keep trucks in lanes designed for them on South and North Conduit. These measures target the patterns police already record: failure to yield, unsafe turning, unsafe speed <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>(NYC Open Data)</a>.</p><p>At City Hall, a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks is under review. Speaker Adams’ office calls it a safety measure and says the process is “deliberative” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-parking-spaces-council-bid-road-safety/>(AMNY)</a>. The council has the power to clear sightlines. Streets will not do it themselves.</p><h3 id=stop-the-worst-repeat-offenders>Stop the worst repeat offenders</h3><p>In Albany, the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> would force drivers with a record of violations to install speed‑limiting tech. State Senator <a href=/senate-district/10/>James Sanders</a> voted yes in committee this June <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>(NYS Senate bill page)</a>. Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/23/>Stacey Pheffer Amato</a> voted no on a separate bill to extend school speed zones <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>(Senate vote log)</a>. Council Speaker <a href=/council-district/28/>Adrienne Adams</a> says visibility at corners is a priority, but the daylighting bill is still stuck in process <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-parking-spaces-council-bid-road-safety/>(AMNY)</a>.</p><p>The record in CB10 is not abstract. It is names, ages, and corners. It is a child hit at Rockaway Boulevard. It is a worker on Nassau Expressway who never made it home.

Cabán’s platform promised safer streets and fewer cars. Ariola and others say the tickets show a gap between words and actions.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2024, Councilwoman Joann Ariola (District 32) publicly criticized Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán after media reports revealed Cabán received four school-zone speeding tickets and three other violations since November 2022. The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Thousands of jobs vanish. Local companies lose out. Lawmakers in affected districts stay silent or cheer. Trains and buses face deep cuts. Riders, workers, and streets pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, Governor Hochul’s official pause on congestion pricing triggered a $12 billion loss in MTA contracts, according to a Reinvent Albany report. The move slashes funding for the 2020-24 MTA capital plan, which was to be partly paid by congestion pricing. The report highlights that many companies losing contracts are in districts represented by lawmakers who either support the pause or have stayed silent. Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick called congestion pricing 'simply another tax' and demanded repeal. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow praised the pause, saying it allows time to address 'communities' concerns.' Frank Russo, president of Ozone Park Lumber, warned, 'You can't just say, 'We're not going to buy supplies and equipment.'' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany said, 'Congestion pricing is an economic booster.' The pause means less money for transit, fewer jobs, and more risk for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, reliable public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
