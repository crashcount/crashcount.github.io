Forty seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, 4,082 crashes tore through these streets. The wounded are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A cyclist left bleeding and alone on 115th Avenue, the driver gone before help arrived. Police said the victim was found &ldquo;unconscious&rdquo; and are &ldquo;now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A moped rider, Antonio Smith-Ortiz, was killed by a wrong-way driver on 149th Avenue. The driver sped off. No arrest. No closure. &ldquo;The driver, who was going against traffic in the eastbound lane, then struck an unoccupied parked 2015 Ford Transit 350 Courier van before speeding off&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/queens-moped-rider-antonio-smith-ortiz-fatally-struck-wrong-way-hit-and-run-driver/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-rest>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Rest</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two.</strong> Even a bus and a taxi took lives. The rest—hundreds—are left with broken bodies, some never to walk again. The Belt Parkway, Nassau Expressway, Lefferts Boulevard. The names change, the outcome does not.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. But in Queens CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No local leader here has stood up with a plan that matches the scale of the blood on the street.</strong> The laws that matter—like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits—are on the books. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The study is not a council bill, but it shapes policy debate. It found that support for automated enforcement—like speed and red-light cameras—increased from 57% to 71% when survey participants were told about racial bias in police traffic stops and the potential for cameras to reduce violent encounters. The study's summary states: 'An interpersonal racial justice frame increases support for traffic safety cameras.' The research follows scrutiny of camera enforcement in New York City and Chicago. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has echoed concerns about equity, noting speed cameras may disproportionately impact communities of color. The study highlights that framing enforcement as a racial justice issue can shift public opinion and may help reduce police encounters that endanger Black and Latino New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study found that support for traffic safety cameras rose from 57 percent to 71 percent when participants heard about racial bias in police stops and the potential for cameras to reduce violent encounters. The matter summary states, 'Most Americans support traffic safety cameras, especially when framed in the context of racial justice.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, District 28, was mentioned in the report, expressing concern that speed cameras may disproportionately burden communities of color. The study underscores that police are 40 percent more likely to stop Black drivers, and 88 percent of suspended license arrests in NYC last year were people of color. The findings suggest that racial justice framing can shift public opinion and may help replace police stops with automated enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, tied to the 2019 'streets master plan' law, aims to add 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of bus lanes by 2026. The proposal, described as a 'historic investment,' must be negotiated with the City Council by June. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams is involved in ongoing talks. The mayor’s plan is less ambitious than the Council’s $3.1 billion proposal, which would add 500 miles of bike lanes and more pedestrian plazas. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez admitted delays in upgrading bike lane barriers. The announcement comes as fatal crashes surge—traffic deaths rose 44% in early 2022. Mayor Adams called for action against dangerous drivers, underscoring the urgent need for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, part of ongoing budget talks, aims to fund hundreds of miles of protected bike and bus lanes, plus concrete barriers. Council Member Lincoln Restler of District 33, a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, praised the move as 'a very clear commitment to addressing street safety across the five boroughs.' The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists. The Council had requested $3.1 billion, but Restler called the $900 million a dramatic investment. The budget must be finalized by June 30.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Speaker Adrienne Adams praised the pilot, saying, 'New Yorkers deserve to live in communities that are safe and clean.' The Council prioritized this effort in its Preliminary Budget Response. Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) are key partners, though some worry about privatizing public space. The program faces logistical and political hurdles, including site plans and maintenance agreements. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi called it 'a new vision' for safer, cleaner public spaces.
