Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two.</strong> Even a bus and a taxi took lives. The rest—hundreds—are left with broken bodies, some never to walk again. The Belt Parkway, Nassau Expressway, Lefferts Boulevard. The names change, the outcome does not.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. But in Queens CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No local leader here has stood up with a plan that matches the scale of the blood on the street.</strong> The laws that matter—like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits—are on the books. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee had advanced the bill, but Speaker Adrienne Adams held it back from a full vote, citing ongoing debate. The bill’s summary: ending NYPD tickets for crossing outside crosswalks, a practice disproportionately enforced against New Yorkers of color. Councilmember Tiffany Cabán, a sponsor, condemned the law’s discriminatory impact and its failure to reduce traffic violence. After lawmakers amended the bill to shield drivers from liability in pedestrian crashes, advocates like Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives withdrew support, insisting the law should 'clearly protect [pedestrians’] right to safety and security.' The latest version still exposes jaywalkers to civil suits and mandates a city safety education campaign. The bill’s future is uncertain.

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with advocates demanding stronger protections for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sixty-one pedestrians died in the first half of 2024. Cyclists and drivers fell too. Midtown leads in bloodshed. Brooklyn breaks records. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams sounds the alarm. Vision Zero falters. The toll mounts.</p><p class=mb3>A July 27, 2024 report highlights a grim milestone: 61 pedestrians killed in NYC since January, the highest six-month toll since Vision Zero began in 2014. The study, cited by Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (District 28), warns, '2024 is on pace to be the deadliest year for traffic violence in the Vision Zero era, which should alarm all New Yorkers.' Adams expressed deep concern and urged the city to hold the line on past safety gains. The report, from Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets, blames the spike on policy failures, especially the cancellation of congestion pricing. Advocates demand immediate action: congestion pricing, more bike lanes, and daylighting intersections. The Department of Transportation promises visibility upgrades at 1,000 intersections and speed reductions under Sammy's Law. But the numbers are stark: 127 killed in six months, a record. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
