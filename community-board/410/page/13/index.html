Forty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 3,000 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars the rest of us cannot see.</p><p>Just days ago, the Belt Parkway saw another crash. A BMW lost control, hit the median, went airborne, and caught fire. <strong>Two people died. Three more were hurt.</strong> The NYPD said, &ldquo;She later succumbed to her injuries and was pronounced dead&rdquo; (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/07/deadly-belt-parkway-crash-howard-beach/>amny</a>). The investigation is ongoing. The road stays open. The traffic moves on.</p><p>On 149th Avenue, a 25-year-old on a motorcycle was killed. The record says only this: &ldquo;Ejected. Apparent death.&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=buses-curbs-and-the-edge-of-disaster>Buses, Curbs, and the Edge of Disaster</h2><p>Last week, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb. Eight people were hurt. The driver told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb at the bus stop&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>). After reviewing video, officials now believe he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. The sidewalk is not safe. The bus stop is not safe. The city keeps moving.</p><h2 id=who-acts-who-waits>Who Acts, Who Waits</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to slow the carnage.</strong> State Senator James Sanders voted yes to require speed-limiting devices for repeat dangerous drivers—an effort to &ldquo;create safer streets for all New Yorkers&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). But not all stand with the vulnerable. Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato voted no on extending school speed zones, opposing a measure that would have protected children (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p><strong>Most deaths here come from cars and SUVs.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, and trucks have killed and maimed the most. Buses and motorcycles add to the toll. The sidewalk is no refuge. The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them: Slow the cars. Protect the people. Every day they wait, another life is at risk.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates warned new language could blame pedestrians for crashes. The bill would have let people cross mid-block, but now demands they yield to drivers. Racial bias in enforcement remains unaddressed.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2024, the City Council delayed action on a bill to legalize jaywalking. The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with advocates demanding stronger protections for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
