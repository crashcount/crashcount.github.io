Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two.</strong> Even a bus and a taxi took lives. The rest—hundreds—are left with broken bodies, some never to walk again. The Belt Parkway, Nassau Expressway, Lefferts Boulevard.

They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. But in Queens CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No local leader here has stood up with a plan that matches the scale of the blood on the street.</strong> The laws that matter—like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits—are on the books. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Council Pushes Mayor to Create City Of Yes … And,' focuses on affordable housing and parking mandates. Speaker Adrienne Adams released her 'City For All' proposal but did not state her position on eliminating mandatory parking, a key part of the mayor’s plan. Council Member Kevin Riley, Chair of the Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises, voiced support for protecting tenants and making vouchers more effective. Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, said the Council’s push for affordability could win over hesitant members. The debate exposes a rift: some Council members want to keep parking mandates, especially in car-heavy districts. The outcome will shape housing, transit, and the city’s streetscape for years.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when a 2011 Honda SUV, driven by a licensed male driver traveling southeast, made a left turn and struck her with the vehicle's left front bumper. The report explicitly cites the driver's failure to yield right-of-way as a contributing factor. The pedestrian sustained contusions and bruises to her knee, lower leg, and foot, classified as injury severity level 3. No other contributing factors related to the pedestrian's actions were noted. Vehicle damage was limited to the left front bumper. This crash highlights the dangers posed by drivers failing to yield during left turns at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a demand to 'pause' the program due to 'sidewalks allegedly rendered impassible by the micromobility devices,' reflects Adams's concerns about scooters left on sidewalks and streets. She stated, 'My constituents have consistently raised questions and concerns about the safety hazards created when e-scooters are frequently left on sidewalks and streets, obstructing pedestrians and all road users.' Adams's stance opposes the current e-scooter share and expansion of micromobility options, but supports stronger regulation and enforcement. The Department of Transportation and advocates highlight the program's success, with nearly 500,000 trips since launch, and argue for better infrastructure instead of a ban. No formal council vote has occurred; this is a public demand from the Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece, published by Streetsblog NYC, scrutinizes Adams’s actions and inactions: 'Adams repeatedly failed to meet annual requirements to add new miles of protected bus and bike lanes under the 2019 Streets Master Plan, despite vowing to exceed those benchmarks while campaigning.' Adams supported removing parking mandates through the City of Yes initiative and expanded daylighting at intersections, but fell short on bike and bus lane expansion. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams threatened legal action over unmet safety mandates. Adams’s administration enabled donor-driven sabotage of safety projects, watered down road diets, and ignored placard abuse. His DOT advanced the BQE rebuild against local opposition. Adams’s rhetoric blamed victims and minimized systemic danger. The result: vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—face greater risk. Promises to reclaim streets for people remain largely unfulfilled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers. Streets belong to people again.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now Local Law 98 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 26, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
