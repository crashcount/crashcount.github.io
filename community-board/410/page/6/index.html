A car jumps the curb. Nine people are hurt in a heartbeat. The street is Liberty Avenue, the date is April 4, 2025. Police say the driver, 79, turned left, veered onto the sidewalk, and struck the bus shelter. Four people waiting for the bus are hit. Two bus riders are hurt. Three in the car are injured. All go to Jamaica Hospital. None die, this time. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-struck-several-people-injured-being-hit-south-richmond-hill/16124727/>Police stated that none of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries.</a></p><p>But the numbers do not rest. In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> on these streets. <strong>Eighteen suffered serious injuries</strong>. <strong>855 were hurt</strong>. Children, elders, workers. The violence is steady. The wounds do not heal.</p><h3 id=the-toll-of-machines>The Toll of Machines</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed three, left 55 with broken bodies, and caused most of the pain.

The bodies are not.</p><h3 id=leaders-words-and-waiting>Leaders: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now set speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is not yet 20. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always close to expiring. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; but the deaths keep coming. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-struck-several-people-injured-being-hit-south-richmond-hill/16124727/>Police report that several pedestrians were struck at the location, resulting in at least nine injuries.</a></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

A 34-year-old male e-scooter driver was injured, sustaining a concussion and upper arm injuries, and was ejected from his vehicle. The report identifies the vehicle driver as making an improper left turn and failing to yield the right-of-way, which directly contributed to the collision. The e-scooter was traveling eastbound, going straight ahead, when it was struck at the center front end by the vehicle turning left. The e-scooter driver was not wearing any safety equipment. The vehicle involved was traveling south and had no occupants other than the driver. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Turning Improperly' as the primary contributing factors, highlighting driver error as the cause of the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

One vehicle was making a right turn while the other continued straight. The report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as the contributing factor for both vehicles. The impact left a 30-year-old male driver with crush injuries to his entire body; he remained conscious and was restrained by a lap belt and harness. The narrative states, 'Steel met steel. A 30-year-old man, belted in, stayed conscious as his body broke.'

The report explicitly cites 'Backing Unsafely' as the contributing factor twice, emphasizing driver error. There were no occupants in the vehicle at the time. The pedestrian was conscious and suffered internal complaints related to the impact.
