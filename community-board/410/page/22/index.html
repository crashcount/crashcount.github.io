Forty seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, 4,082 crashes tore through these streets. The wounded are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A cyclist left bleeding and alone on 115th Avenue, the driver gone before help arrived. Police said the victim was found &ldquo;unconscious&rdquo; and are &ldquo;now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A moped rider, Antonio Smith-Ortiz, was killed by a wrong-way driver on 149th Avenue. The driver sped off. No arrest. No closure. &ldquo;The driver, who was going against traffic in the eastbound lane, then struck an unoccupied parked 2015 Ford Transit 350 Courier van before speeding off&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/queens-moped-rider-antonio-smith-ortiz-fatally-struck-wrong-way-hit-and-run-driver/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-rest>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Rest</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two.</strong> Even a bus and a taxi took lives. The rest—hundreds—are left with broken bodies, some never to walk again. The Belt Parkway, Nassau Expressway, Lefferts Boulevard. The names change, the outcome does not.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. But in Queens CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No local leader here has stood up with a plan that matches the scale of the blood on the street.</strong> The laws that matter—like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits—are on the books. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Adams questioned the NYPD's use of officers for minor vehicle stops and called for a full overhaul of current practices. She highlighted data showing Black and Latino New Yorkers face disproportionate stops, arrests, and use of force. The Council considered bills to require more NYPD reporting on these practices. NYPD Director of Legislative Affairs Michael Clarke defended the current approach, stressing officer involvement in traffic safety.

Delivery workers’ safety and livelihoods hung in the balance. Lawmakers targeted sellers, not riders. The bills aimed to stop deadly fires without punishing those who rely on e-bikes to survive.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, the New York City Council advanced a package of lithium-ion battery safety bills. Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Workers, City Coffers Will Lose Out if Council Ditches Year-Round Street Dining, Experts Say,' drew strong opinions. Council Member Chi Ossé called for a study, warning that small businesses would suffer if forced to remove and rebuild sheds each year. Council Members Jennifer Gutiérrez, Lincoln Restler, and Tiffany Cabán also supported a 12-month program. Speaker Adrienne Adams praised the program’s transformation of city streets, though she suggested moving dining to sidewalks. Advocates like Majora Carter argued that seasonal limits would make outdoor seating a luxury, not a public good.

The Council, led by Speaker Adrienne Adams, is advancing a bill for a permanent program but wants to limit roadway dining to warmer months. The matter, described as a push to 'keep outdoor dining in the roadway year-round,' drew sharp criticism from small business owners and open space advocates. Donna Drakes, Felicia Park-Rogers, and Charlotta Janssen spoke out against seasonal limits, citing high costs and lost public space. Matthew Clarke of the Design Trust for Public Space urged the Council to keep the program under DOT and rethink street use. The Council has not finalized the bill. Discussions continue.

The measure, expected before lawmakers next month, keeps sidewalk dining year-round but limits curbside 'streeteries' to warmer months. Council Member Justin Brannan said, 'The plan is not to make permanent the current outdoor dining sheds you see on our streets ... but to create a better program with new rules, new standards, clear design guidelines and operating requirements.' Speaker Adrienne Adams leads the Council in fine-tuning the bill, while Mayor Adams supports Department of Transportation oversight. Council Member Marjorie Velázquez’s original bill would have shifted control to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans argue, 'A year-round option is an absolute must.' The bill responds to complaints about noise, rats, and lost parking, but also credits the program with saving 100,000 jobs. The Council’s move reshapes public space, but the safety impact for pedestrians and cyclists remains unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
