Forty-one left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In Queens CB10, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, the streets have claimed lives and broken bodies. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry the weight. In the last year alone, two more people died. Four were seriously hurt. The pain is not spread evenly. It falls hardest on those outside the car—walkers, cyclists, children.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a BMW vaulted the median on the Belt Parkway and slammed into oncoming cars. Six people were hurt, three left fighting for life.</strong> Police closed the road. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad came to count the damage. &ldquo;It was unclear what caused the driver to lose control but police said speed may have been an issue,&rdquo; the <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>Post reported</a>. The cause is always the same: speed, steel, and the city’s refusal to change.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm.</strong> They killed three. They left hundreds with broken bones and worse. Trucks and buses took another life. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one more. Bikes injured two. The street is a battleground, but only some are armed.</p><p>The stories repeat. A woman crossing the street, struck by a bus. A child hit by a turning car. A moped rider ejected and left dead on the expressway. The names change. The grief does not.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have voted both ways.</strong> Council Member Joann Ariola voted against legalizing jaywalking, a law that would have shifted blame away from pedestrians and toward drivers. She also voted no on daylighting, a proven fix that clears sightlines at corners. But she has backed bills for better lighting and safer truck routes. The record is mixed. The results are not. &ldquo;Our leaders are failing New Yorkers,&rdquo; <a href="https://transalt.org/press-releases/new-york-city-experiences-deadliest-first-six-months-in-vision-zero-history-new-analysis-from-transportation-alternatives-and-families-for-safe-streets-shows#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20leaders%20are%20failing%20New,risk%20by%20turning%20a%20blind">said Transportation Alternatives</a>.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph.

The MTA demanded $4 billion from the city—a 33% jump from the last plan—warning of major subway disruptions if denied. The matter, titled 'MTA threatens another ‘Summer of Hell’ of subway disruptions if NYC doesn’t cough up billions,' drew sharp words. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Queens) blasted the agency: 'Instead of insulting us with baseless threats, the agency that spends $30 million on a staircase should find ways to cut its wasteful spending and bloated payroll before asking for more taxpayer money.' Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility. Despite heated criticism, council members did not strongly oppose the request in session. The hearing left the city’s most vulnerable riders—those who rely on safe, reliable transit—caught between political fights and crumbling infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
