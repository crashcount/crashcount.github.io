Forty-one left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In Queens CB10, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, the streets have claimed lives and broken bodies. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry the weight. In the last year alone, two more people died. Four were seriously hurt. The pain is not spread evenly. It falls hardest on those outside the car—walkers, cyclists, children.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a BMW vaulted the median on the Belt Parkway and slammed into oncoming cars. Six people were hurt, three left fighting for life.</strong> Police closed the road. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad came to count the damage. &ldquo;It was unclear what caused the driver to lose control but police said speed may have been an issue,&rdquo; the <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>Post reported</a>. The cause is always the same: speed, steel, and the city’s refusal to change.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm.</strong> They killed three. They left hundreds with broken bones and worse. Trucks and buses took another life. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one more. Bikes injured two. The street is a battleground, but only some are armed.</p><p>The stories repeat. A woman crossing the street, struck by a bus. A child hit by a turning car. A moped rider ejected and left dead on the expressway. The names change. The grief does not.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have voted both ways.</strong> Council Member Joann Ariola voted against legalizing jaywalking, a law that would have shifted blame away from pedestrians and toward drivers. She also voted no on daylighting, a proven fix that clears sightlines at corners. But she has backed bills for better lighting and safer truck routes. The record is mixed. The results are not. &ldquo;Our leaders are failing New Yorkers,&rdquo; <a href="https://transalt.org/press-releases/new-york-city-experiences-deadliest-first-six-months-in-vision-zero-history-new-analysis-from-transportation-alternatives-and-families-for-safe-streets-shows#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20leaders%20are%20failing%20New,risk%20by%20turning%20a%20blind">said Transportation Alternatives</a>.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph.

The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' for both vehicles and specifically notes 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' by the westbound driver. Additionally, illegal drug use was cited as a contributing factor for the passengers in the northbound vehicle. All occupants were restrained with lap belts and harnesses and none were ejected. The collision damage was centered on the front ends of both vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30) criticized New York City’s congestion pricing plan, which will charge drivers $15 to enter below 60th Street. The matter, titled 'NYC’s Upper West Side already becoming commuter parking lot for congestion-pricing evaders,' highlights growing concern that the plan will shift traffic and pollution to neighborhoods like the Upper West Side, Kew Gardens, Staten Island, and Brooklyn. Holden said, 'You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out: if you are going to charge people $15 to go below 60th, those people will look for alternatives.' Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, a supporter, admitted, 'It’s going to get worse once there’s a charge at 60th Street—no doubt about it.' Councilwoman Lynn Shulman backs a residential permit parking pilot to address spillover. Community leaders say residents were not consulted.

This follows Mayor Adams’s earlier $35 million commitment. The matter centers on whether to build a park or restore rail service—"Its purpose is to derail the train," said Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director. City Hall, represented by spokesperson Charles Lutvak, insists, "The proposed Met Hub does not preclude an MTA project if [MTA officials] determine one is feasible." Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi echoed, "Those two don't directly conflict." State Sen. James Sanders Jr. continues to push for QueensLink funding. The city’s investments so far favor the park, leaving the rail proposal in limbo. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
