Forty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 3,000 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars the rest of us cannot see.</p><p>Just days ago, the Belt Parkway saw another crash. A BMW lost control, hit the median, went airborne, and caught fire. <strong>Two people died. Three more were hurt.</strong> The NYPD said, &ldquo;She later succumbed to her injuries and was pronounced dead&rdquo; (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/07/deadly-belt-parkway-crash-howard-beach/>amny</a>). The investigation is ongoing. The road stays open. The traffic moves on.</p><p>On 149th Avenue, a 25-year-old on a motorcycle was killed. The record says only this: &ldquo;Ejected. Apparent death.&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=buses-curbs-and-the-edge-of-disaster>Buses, Curbs, and the Edge of Disaster</h2><p>Last week, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb. Eight people were hurt. The driver told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb at the bus stop&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>). After reviewing video, officials now believe he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. The sidewalk is not safe. The bus stop is not safe. The city keeps moving.</p><h2 id=who-acts-who-waits>Who Acts, Who Waits</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to slow the carnage.</strong> State Senator James Sanders voted yes to require speed-limiting devices for repeat dangerous drivers—an effort to &ldquo;create safer streets for all New Yorkers&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). But not all stand with the vulnerable. Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato voted no on extending school speed zones, opposing a measure that would have protected children (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p><strong>Most deaths here come from cars and SUVs.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, and trucks have killed and maimed the most. Buses and motorcycles add to the toll. The sidewalk is no refuge. The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them: Slow the cars. Protect the people. Every day they wait, another life is at risk.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Governor Kathy Hochul signed this and other safety bills into law. Charter bus passengers ages 8 to 16 must now wear seatbelts, a response to a fatal crash in Orange County. Sammy's Law, enacted in 2024, lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, and even 10 mph on redesigned streets. The Department of Transportation will target 250 locations, focusing on school zones. The MTA launches congestion pricing in Manhattan, with funds set for transit upgrades.

The narrative underscores that 'the drivers missed the signs,' highlighting systemic failures in driver compliance with traffic controls.

According to the police report, 'A bus turned left. A 64-year-old woman walked with the light. The bumper struck her full. Her body crushed. She stayed awake.' The crash occurred at 18:28. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor. The woman suffered crush injuries to her entire body but remained conscious at the scene. The impact point was the bus’s left front bumper. The pedestrian’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted in the report, but the driver’s failure to yield is the primary factor cited by police. No contributing behaviors are attributed to the victim.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The SUV driver, a 22-year-old male with a permit license, was following too closely and struck the sedan's center back end as it was slowing or stopping. The sedan driver, a 26-year-old female licensed driver, was also slowing or stopping but had to react to an uninvolved vehicle, contributing to the collision. Both drivers were injured: the SUV driver suffered back injuries and whiplash, while the sedan driver sustained contusions to the knee and lower leg.
