Forty seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, 4,082 crashes tore through these streets. The wounded are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A cyclist left bleeding and alone on 115th Avenue, the driver gone before help arrived. Police said the victim was found &ldquo;unconscious&rdquo; and are &ldquo;now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A moped rider, Antonio Smith-Ortiz, was killed by a wrong-way driver on 149th Avenue. The driver sped off. No arrest. No closure. &ldquo;The driver, who was going against traffic in the eastbound lane, then struck an unoccupied parked 2015 Ford Transit 350 Courier van before speeding off&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/queens-moped-rider-antonio-smith-ortiz-fatally-struck-wrong-way-hit-and-run-driver/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-rest>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Rest</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two.</strong> Even a bus and a taxi took lives. The rest—hundreds—are left with broken bodies, some never to walk again. The Belt Parkway, Nassau Expressway, Lefferts Boulevard. The names change, the outcome does not.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. But in Queens CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No local leader here has stood up with a plan that matches the scale of the blood on the street.</strong> The laws that matter—like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits—are on the books. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure would let New York City set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets in the Open Streets program. The matter title reads: 'authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Carlina Rivera. The committee approved the resolution with strong support. The bill targets streets where pedestrians and cyclists mix with traffic. Lower speeds mean fewer crashes and less severe injuries. The council’s action puts pressure on Albany to give the city the power to protect people where they are most exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Albany remains split. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Governor Hochul announced a pause on congestion pricing, sparking confusion in Albany. The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged. Vulnerable road users are left exposed as transit funding falters.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city promised to pass legislation within a year to control warehouse emissions and restrict new facilities in low-income areas without review.

Torres-Springer wrote, 'The city shares the Council's desire to take near-term steps to address the harmful effects of last-mile operations.' The new rules will empower the Department of Environmental Preservation and propose zoning changes, though they are not part of the current zoning plan due to procedural limits.
