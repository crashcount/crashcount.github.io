Forty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 3,000 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars the rest of us cannot see.</p><p>Just days ago, the Belt Parkway saw another crash. A BMW lost control, hit the median, went airborne, and caught fire. <strong>Two people died. Three more were hurt.</strong> The NYPD said, &ldquo;She later succumbed to her injuries and was pronounced dead&rdquo; (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/07/deadly-belt-parkway-crash-howard-beach/>amny</a>). The investigation is ongoing. The road stays open. The traffic moves on.</p><p>On 149th Avenue, a 25-year-old on a motorcycle was killed. The record says only this: &ldquo;Ejected. Apparent death.&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=buses-curbs-and-the-edge-of-disaster>Buses, Curbs, and the Edge of Disaster</h2><p>Last week, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb. Eight people were hurt. The driver told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb at the bus stop&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>). After reviewing video, officials now believe he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. The sidewalk is not safe. The bus stop is not safe. The city keeps moving.</p><h2 id=who-acts-who-waits>Who Acts, Who Waits</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to slow the carnage.</strong> State Senator James Sanders voted yes to require speed-limiting devices for repeat dangerous drivers—an effort to &ldquo;create safer streets for all New Yorkers&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). But not all stand with the vulnerable. Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato voted no on extending school speed zones, opposing a measure that would have protected children (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p><strong>Most deaths here come from cars and SUVs.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, and trucks have killed and maimed the most. Buses and motorcycles add to the toll. The sidewalk is no refuge. The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them: Slow the cars. Protect the people. Every day they wait, another life is at risk.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
