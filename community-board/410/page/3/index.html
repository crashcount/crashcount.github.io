In Queens CB10, the numbers are blunt. <strong>Thirteen people dead. Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,700 hurt since 2022. Each number is a life changed or ended. Each crash is a story that does not end well.</p><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway. The car hit the divider, flew into oncoming traffic, and caught fire. <strong>No one inside wore a seat belt.</strong> Two young lives ended. Others crawled from the wreckage, dazed and bleeding. A survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;They went airborne and into the barrier.&rdquo; The horror did not stop at the crash. Families are left with the memory of bodies thrown from the car, and a fire that would not go out.</p><p>A few days before, a 76-year-old woman died in a Queens pizzeria. An e-bike battery exploded outside the bathroom. The fire moved fast. The FDNY <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/us-news/grandma-76-killed-when-e-bike-battery-explodes-like-blowtorch-inside-nyc-pizzeria-on-fourth-of-july-fdny/>called it a &ldquo;blowtorch effect.&rdquo;</a> She could not escape. Her son found her burned, almost beyond recognition. &ldquo;For me to find my mom burnt like a roast pig&mldr; is a memory I cannot forget.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>Crashes are not random.</strong> In the last year, six people died here. Seventeen suffered serious injuries. The wounded are young and old—children, parents, elders. Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. Trucks, motorcycles, buses, and even bikes left their mark. The Belt Parkway, Lefferts Boulevard, and 149th Avenue are not safe for anyone outside a car.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h3><p>Some bills have passed. Council Member Joann Ariola voted for step street lighting and truck route redesigns. She co-sponsored bills for raised speed reducers and pedestrian lighting. But she also voted <strong>against daylighting intersections</strong> and <strong>against legalizing jaywalking</strong>—measures proven to protect people on foot. She opposed congestion pricing, which would have meant fewer cars and safer streets. She even voted against expanding speed cameras, despite her own car racking up <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>27 school-zone speeding tickets</a>.</p><p><strong>The silence is deadly.</strong> Every delay, every vote against proven safety, means another family gets the call no one wants.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-now>What You Can Do Now</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org/>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org/>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Do not wait for the next siren. The next body. The next headline.</p><p><strong>The road will not change itself. You must.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Jennifer Gutiérrez and a long list of co-sponsors. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law orders all taxis and for-hire vehicles to post warning decals on rear passenger doors, alerting riders to check for cyclists before opening. The Taxi and Limousine Commission will provide the signs at no cost. The measure targets dooring, a common threat to cyclists.

The city’s most vulnerable face the risk underground.</p><p class=mb3>On April 26, 2025, City Council Minority Leader Joann Ariola (District 32) publicly criticized New York’s congestion pricing policy, linking it to rising subway assaults. The event, covered by nypost.com, followed a fatal stabbing and NYPD data showing felony assaults up 9% this year. Ariola warned, 'Forcing more New Yorkers underground with this ridiculous congestion pricing scheme is going to put more people into contact with the dangerously unwell.' She called the subway the city's 'de facto mental institution and homeless shelter.' The policy, supported by Governor Hochul, has increased subway and bus ridership by 6% and 9%. Ariola’s stance: congestion pricing endangers vulnerable riders, forcing them into unsafe conditions. The city has responded with more police and outreach, but many riders remain fearful.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On Woodhaven Boulevard, Rosen struck McField from behind, ran him over, and continued driving, dragging the motorcycle until it caught fire. Rosen then hit another car before stopping at a lamp post. McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes."
