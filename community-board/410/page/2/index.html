Forty-one left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In Queens CB10, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, the streets have claimed lives and broken bodies. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry the weight. In the last year alone, two more people died. Four were seriously hurt. The pain is not spread evenly. It falls hardest on those outside the car—walkers, cyclists, children.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a BMW vaulted the median on the Belt Parkway and slammed into oncoming cars. Six people were hurt, three left fighting for life.</strong> Police closed the road. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad came to count the damage. &ldquo;It was unclear what caused the driver to lose control but police said speed may have been an issue,&rdquo; the <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>Post reported</a>. The cause is always the same: speed, steel, and the city’s refusal to change.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm.</strong> They killed three. They left hundreds with broken bones and worse. Trucks and buses took another life. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one more. Bikes injured two. The street is a battleground, but only some are armed.</p><p>The stories repeat. A woman crossing the street, struck by a bus. A child hit by a turning car. A moped rider ejected and left dead on the expressway. The names change. The grief does not.</p><h3 id=leaders-action-and-inaction>Leaders: Action and Inaction</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have voted both ways.</strong> Council Member Joann Ariola voted against legalizing jaywalking, a law that would have shifted blame away from pedestrians and toward drivers. She also voted no on daylighting, a proven fix that clears sightlines at corners. But she has backed bills for better lighting and safer truck routes. The record is mixed. The results are not. &ldquo;Our leaders are failing New Yorkers,&rdquo; <a href="https://transalt.org/press-releases/new-york-city-experiences-deadliest-first-six-months-in-vision-zero-history-new-analysis-from-transportation-alternatives-and-families-for-safe-streets-shows#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20leaders%20are%20failing%20New,risk%20by%20turning%20a%20blind">said Transportation Alternatives</a>.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph.

The board voted for new safety measures.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2025, a proposed ban on bicycles along Rockaway Beach’s boardwalk was canceled after public backlash. The plan, discussed at a community board meeting, would have barred cyclists from Beach 108th to Beach 73rd Street during summer months. Council Member Joann Ariola, representing District 32, expressed relief at the reversal, stating, 'I’m glad that the Parks Department is going to continue allowing Rockaway residents to enjoy their bikes on the boardwalk this summer, but now we need real enforcement.' Instead of a ban, the Parks Department will increase signage and enforcement, especially near concessions. The community board voted 30-1 for new signs and called for marked bike lanes, an 8 mph speed limit, and clearer right-of-way rules. Board chair Dolores Orr stressed these safety improvements have been needed since the boardwalk’s post-Sandy rebuild.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
