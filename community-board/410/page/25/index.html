In Queens CB10, the numbers are blunt. <strong>Thirteen people dead. Forty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,700 hurt since 2022. Each number is a life changed or ended. Each crash is a story that does not end well.</p><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway. The car hit the divider, flew into oncoming traffic, and caught fire. <strong>No one inside wore a seat belt.</strong> Two young lives ended. Others crawled from the wreckage, dazed and bleeding. A survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;They went airborne and into the barrier.&rdquo; The horror did not stop at the crash. Families are left with the memory of bodies thrown from the car, and a fire that would not go out.</p><p>A few days before, a 76-year-old woman died in a Queens pizzeria. An e-bike battery exploded outside the bathroom. The fire moved fast. The FDNY <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/us-news/grandma-76-killed-when-e-bike-battery-explodes-like-blowtorch-inside-nyc-pizzeria-on-fourth-of-july-fdny/>called it a &ldquo;blowtorch effect.&rdquo;</a> She could not escape. Her son found her burned, almost beyond recognition. &ldquo;For me to find my mom burnt like a roast pig&mldr; is a memory I cannot forget.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>Crashes are not random.</strong> In the last year, six people died here. Seventeen suffered serious injuries. The wounded are young and old—children, parents, elders. Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. Trucks, motorcycles, buses, and even bikes left their mark. The Belt Parkway, Lefferts Boulevard, and 149th Avenue are not safe for anyone outside a car.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h3><p>Some bills have passed. Council Member Joann Ariola voted for step street lighting and truck route redesigns. She co-sponsored bills for raised speed reducers and pedestrian lighting. But she also voted <strong>against daylighting intersections</strong> and <strong>against legalizing jaywalking</strong>—measures proven to protect people on foot. She opposed congestion pricing, which would have meant fewer cars and safer streets. She even voted against expanding speed cameras, despite her own car racking up <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>27 school-zone speeding tickets</a>.</p><p><strong>The silence is deadly.</strong> Every delay, every vote against proven safety, means another family gets the call no one wants.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-now>What You Can Do Now</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org/>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org/>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Do not wait for the next siren. The next body. The next headline.</p><p><strong>The road will not change itself. You must.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Chicago has it, why can’t we have it?" -- Khaleel Anderson</p><p class=mb3>On March 27, 2022, a public consultation in Queens reviewed 14 alternatives for LaGuardia Airport transit access. The session followed Governor Hochul’s cancellation of the Willets Point AirTrain. The event, covered by the media and led by a panel including Janette Sadik-Khan, drew strong opinions. The matter summary: 'In Astoria, Queens, 14 possible transit options for connecting to LaGuardia Airport were presented at a public comment session.' Council Member Larinda Hooks (District 35) voiced support for the original AirTrain, ferry service, and other mass transit options, but opposed removing parking or traffic lanes. Hooks said, 'The original plan is still the best plan... It doesn’t go near anybody’s house.' The process continues. No final plan. Vulnerable road users still face risk as traffic and confusion persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
