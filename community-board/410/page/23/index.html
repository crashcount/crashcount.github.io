Forty seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, 4,082 crashes tore through these streets. The wounded are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A cyclist left bleeding and alone on 115th Avenue, the driver gone before help arrived. Police said the victim was found &ldquo;unconscious&rdquo; and are &ldquo;now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A moped rider, Antonio Smith-Ortiz, was killed by a wrong-way driver on 149th Avenue. The driver sped off. No arrest. No closure. &ldquo;The driver, who was going against traffic in the eastbound lane, then struck an unoccupied parked 2015 Ford Transit 350 Courier van before speeding off&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/queens-moped-rider-antonio-smith-ortiz-fatally-struck-wrong-way-hit-and-run-driver/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-rest>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Rest</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two.</strong> Even a bus and a taxi took lives. The rest—hundreds—are left with broken bodies, some never to walk again. The Belt Parkway, Nassau Expressway, Lefferts Boulevard. The names change, the outcome does not.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about speed cameras, about lowering limits. But in Queens CB10, the carnage continues. <strong>No local leader here has stood up with a plan that matches the scale of the blood on the street.</strong> The laws that matter—like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits—are on the books. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark unless Albany acts. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, led by Council Member Marjorie Velázquez, remains under negotiation. Speaker Adrienne Adams, speaking at a Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce event, said, "We're almost there, so we've got high hopes for something happening very very soon." The bill proposes shifting oversight from the Department of Transportation to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection and making the program seasonal. Mayor Adams wants DOT to keep control. Speaker Adams and most council members support continuing outdoor dining, but opponents cite noise, garbage, and parking loss. The program expanded rapidly during the pandemic, especially in working-class neighborhoods of color. Advocates push for affordable, flexible setups and citywide standards. The council seeks a balance between business and neighborhood needs.

The hearing, set for February, follows a grim analysis: 'More children were killed last year by vehicles in New York City than any year since the launch of the street safety initiative Vision Zero.' Adams stated, 'The increase in traffic fatalities since 2018 is alarming, particularly the rise in children killed by traffic violence.' The report highlights that the city is not on pace to meet the 2019 Streets Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of bus lanes in five years. Disparities in hit-and-run arrests remain stark between white neighborhoods and neighborhoods of color. Advocates urge urgent action to meet Vision Zero’s original promise and end traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law, named after Carlos Moncayo, aims to curb a surge in construction worker deaths—22 in the past year, the highest in five years. State Sen. Jessica Ramos, representing District 13, called the law 'critically needed' as thousands of migrants enter non-union construction jobs lacking basic safety protections. Ramos and other lawmakers supported the bill, but advocates and union officials warn that without strong enforcement and education for new arrivals, deaths and injuries will persist. The law passed after years of advocacy, but the minimum fine was removed, and nonprofits struggle to train the influx of new workers.

Outdoor dining spread to 17 neighborhoods that never had it. Blue-collar districts of color gained most. Manhattan’s dominance faded. Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx doubled their share. The fight now: who controls the future.</p><p class=mb3>On January 19, 2023, a new report detailed the impact of New York City’s pandemic-era open restaurants program. The program, debated in the Council and championed by Speaker Adrienne Adams, brought outdoor dining to 17 community boards previously shut out by high fees and red tape. The report states, 'Dining in all neighborhoods [should be] a permanent part of the city’s streetscape.' Brooklyn’s share of outdoor dining rose from 16% to 25%, while Manhattan’s dropped from 70% to 49%. Queens and the Bronx doubled their share. Speaker Adams opposes dining sheds in the roadway and seeks to shift oversight from DOT to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Advocates warn DCWP lacks resources and fear a return to restrictive rules. DOT supports keeping the process simple and affordable, citing equity and vibrant streets. The Council’s decision will shape who benefits—and who is left out.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It aimed to restore impoundment powers and repeal recent legal protections. The measure targeted riders, not drivers. The bill died at session’s end. Vulnerable users remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0883-2023 was introduced in the City Council on January 19, 2023, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill proposed to amend the administrative code by expanding the definition of 'motorized scooter' to include e-bikes and e-scooters, raising civil penalties for violations from $250 to $500, and restoring impoundment authority. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the operation of motorized scooters, and to repeal subdivision e of section 19-176.2 of such code, relating to operators of electric scooters and bicycles with electric assist.' Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Inna Vernikov, Joann Ariola, Vickie Paladino, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Kalman Yeger, and James F. Gennaro sponsored the bill. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. No safety analyst assessment was provided. The bill’s focus was on enforcement and penalties, not on systemic danger from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
