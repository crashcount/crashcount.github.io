Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass, clipped a Volkswagen, then hit two bikes on the Bronx River Parkway near E. 223rd St. Both men, 19 and 21, were thrown and later pronounced dead. The driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI and released without bail, according to the reports. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“Two people were killed. He was drunk,”</a> a sister said outside court. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“How could they let him go?”</a></p><p>Police identified the victims as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. A complaint says the driver had a strong odor of alcohol and stood unsteadily. He refused a chemical test. The southbound lanes closed near Exit 9. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> and <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>AMNY</a> matched the police account. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-arrested-in-bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>CBS New York</a> said both men were riding scooters.</p><p>This is Bronx Community Board 11. Pelham Parkway‑Van Nest. Morris Park. Pelham Gardens. Allerton. Streets where people walk to work, to school, to the train. Streets where speed wins.</p><p>—</p><p>Where people get hit</p><p>Since 2022, three pedestrians, one bicyclist, and one moped rider have been killed on CB11 streets, city data show. Hundreds more were hurt. The worst pain clusters at corners you know: <a href=#>Bronxdale Ave</a> and <a href=#>East Gun Hill Road</a>. City data flag Bronxdale for seven serious injuries and 16 total injuries; Gun Hill logs 52 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data crash tables</a> tell the count.</p><p>The hours tell a second story. Injuries spike after school and into the commute. 3 p.m. sees 125 injured. 5 p.m. sees 135 and five serious injuries. Deaths hit at noon, 5 p.m., 9 p.m., 11 p.m., and 8 a.m. The clock doesn’t care. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> log the times.</p><p>The causes are as plain as a turn of a wheel. “Failure to yield.” “Disregarded traffic control.” “Unsafe speed.” “Inattention.” A box truck turned left at Neill and Paulding and killed a 16‑year‑old girl in the crosswalk. The record reads “failure to yield.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4525006</a>. A sedan went straight on Rhinelander and took a 91‑year‑old man at Radcliff. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4580960</a>. A cyclist, 64, was killed on Williamsbridge at Pierce in a multi‑vehicle crash with a truck. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4618759</a>.</p><p>—</p><p>What the numbers won’t let go</p><p>In the last 12 months, CB11 logged 873 crashes, 619 injuries, 14 serious injuries. Year‑to‑date injuries are up 73% against last year’s pace. Crashes are up 51%. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City tables</a> carry the trend.</p><p>Pedestrians take the blows from cars and SUVs most. Ninety pedestrian cases tied to sedans. One hundred fifteen tied to SUVs. Trucks killed one pedestrian here and injured more. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Mode rollups</a> show who does the harm.</p><p>—</p><p>Hot corners to fix now</p><p>Start with the turns. Harden them. Daylight the crosswalks. Give leading pedestrian intervals on Bronxdale Ave and Pelham Parkway North, and along East Gun Hill Road. The left‑turning box truck that killed the girl at Neill and Paulding was making a common move. Protect it with geometry that forces slow turns and clear sightlines. Use truck plates to steer heavy vehicles off narrow residential streets at school hours. Target the rush‑hour windows that the injury clock already marked. These fixes match the failures logged in the data: failure to yield; unsafe speed; heavy vehicles at fault. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>Open Data</a> shows the patterns.</p><p>—</p><p>The parkway crash is not an outlier</p><p>Police say the Bronx River Parkway deaths came after an attempted pass and alleged drunk driving. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> reported vehicular manslaughter and DWI charges. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>AMNY</a> listed the charges and the victims’ names. The families asked why the driver walked free that day. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a> ran their words: “How could they let him go?”</p><p>—</p><p>Cut speed everywhere, stop the repeat offenders</p><p>Albany gave New York City power to lower speed limits. The city can set 20 mph on local streets. It has started to do so in places, but the default still stands. We don’t need another vigil to prove what speed does. Families already know. Take the power and use it. <a href=../../take_action/>Our action guide</a> lays out the calls.</p><p>A small group of drivers does outsized harm. Bills in Albany would force the worst repeat speeders to install intelligent speed‑assist devices. Senate bill S4045 advanced with yes votes from Bronx senators. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States shows the votes</a>. The data behind it are stark: the 1.5% of drivers with long violation histories cause a fifth of pedestrian deaths; 16 camera tickets in a year doubles the risk; 30 tickets multiplies it fifty‑fold. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog analysis</a> traces the link.</p><p>—</p><p>Names, dates, corners. It keeps happening. The map doesn’t forget. Neither should we.</p><p>Act: Tell City Hall to set a 20 mph default and back speed limiters for repeat offenders.

Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way. The bill targets that risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
