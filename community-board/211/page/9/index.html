Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, 1,414 neighbors have been hurt in 2,413 crashes. The dead include a 16-year-old girl, a 51-year-old woman, a 91-year-old man. Each was walking. Each was struck at an intersection.

The city lowered speed limits in some places. Cameras catch speeders, but only where the law allows. The mayor says, &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-sought-after-deadly-bronx-hit-and-run/>but the deaths keep coming</a>. The council can lower speeds to 20 mph. They have not done it citywide. The state lets cameras run, but the law is always up for renewal. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a name on a stone.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name.

Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz stated, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz highlighted the broader issue: "We’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced." The incident underscores the risks posed by illegal parking and the need for stricter enforcement and infrastructure checks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
