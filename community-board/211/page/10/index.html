Streets where speed wins.</p><p>—</p><p>Where people get hit</p><p>Since 2022, three pedestrians, one bicyclist, and one moped rider have been killed on CB11 streets, city data show. Hundreds more were hurt. The worst pain clusters at corners you know: <a href=#>Bronxdale Ave</a> and <a href=#>East Gun Hill Road</a>. City data flag Bronxdale for seven serious injuries and 16 total injuries; Gun Hill logs 52 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data crash tables</a> tell the count.</p><p>The hours tell a second story. Injuries spike after school and into the commute. 3 p.m. sees 125 injured. 5 p.m. sees 135 and five serious injuries. Deaths hit at noon, 5 p.m., 9 p.m., 11 p.m., and 8 a.m. The clock doesn’t care. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> log the times.</p><p>The causes are as plain as a turn of a wheel. “Failure to yield.” “Disregarded traffic control.” “Unsafe speed.” “Inattention.” A box truck turned left at Neill and Paulding and killed a 16‑year‑old girl in the crosswalk. The record reads “failure to yield.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4525006</a>. A sedan went straight on Rhinelander and took a 91‑year‑old man at Radcliff. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4580960</a>. A cyclist, 64, was killed on Williamsbridge at Pierce in a multi‑vehicle crash with a truck. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4618759</a>.</p><p>—</p><p>What the numbers won’t let go</p><p>In the last 12 months, CB11 logged 873 crashes, 619 injuries, 14 serious injuries. Year‑to‑date injuries are up 73% against last year’s pace. Crashes are up 51%. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City tables</a> carry the trend.</p><p>Pedestrians take the blows from cars and SUVs most. Ninety pedestrian cases tied to sedans. One hundred fifteen tied to SUVs. Trucks killed one pedestrian here and injured more. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Mode rollups</a> show who does the harm.</p><p>—</p><p>Hot corners to fix now</p><p>Start with the turns. Harden them. Daylight the crosswalks. Give leading pedestrian intervals on Bronxdale Ave and Pelham Parkway North, and along East Gun Hill Road. The left‑turning box truck that killed the girl at Neill and Paulding was making a common move. Protect it with geometry that forces slow turns and clear sightlines. Use truck plates to steer heavy vehicles off narrow residential streets at school hours. Target the rush‑hour windows that the injury clock already marked. These fixes match the failures logged in the data: failure to yield; unsafe speed; heavy vehicles at fault. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>Open Data</a> shows the patterns.</p><p>—</p><p>The parkway crash is not an outlier</p><p>Police say the Bronx River Parkway deaths came after an attempted pass and alleged drunk driving. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> reported vehicular manslaughter and DWI charges. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>AMNY</a> listed the charges and the victims’ names. The families asked why the driver walked free that day. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a> ran their words: “How could they let him go?”</p><p>—</p><p>Cut speed everywhere, stop the repeat offenders</p><p>Albany gave New York City power to lower speed limits. The city can set 20 mph on local streets. It has started to do so in places, but the default still stands. We don’t need another vigil to prove what speed does. Families already know. Take the power and use it. <a href=../../take_action/>Our action guide</a> lays out the calls.</p><p>A small group of drivers does outsized harm. Bills in Albany would force the worst repeat speeders to install intelligent speed‑assist devices. Senate bill S4045 advanced with yes votes from Bronx senators. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States shows the votes</a>. The data behind it are stark: the 1.5% of drivers with long violation histories cause a fifth of pedestrian deaths; 16 camera tickets in a year doubles the risk; 30 tickets multiplies it fifty‑fold. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog analysis</a> traces the link.</p><p>—</p><p>Names, dates, corners. It keeps happening. The map doesn’t forget. Neither should we.</p><p>Act: Tell City Hall to set a 20 mph default and back speed limiters for repeat offenders. Start here: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

Council Member Marmorato and Borough President Richards defend these rules, blocking safer, more vibrant neighborhoods. Ending mandates means more housing, cleaner air, and safer streets for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion, published September 3, 2024, in Streetsblog NYC, calls out Council Member Kristy Marmorato and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards for defending parking mandates. Richards opposes lifting mandates in Queens, citing poor transit. Marmorato lobbied to restore mandates in a Bronx rezoning near new Metro North stations, arguing, 'We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities.' The editorial rebukes this logic, stating, 'We should not cling to parking mandates when we know they encourage car ownership, make streets less vibrant, increase rents, and pollute our air.' The piece urges officials to break the cycle of car-first policy, invest in transit, and end mandates that block affordable housing and safer streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the editorial centers the harm parking mandates inflict on vulnerable road users and the city’s livability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law orders the Department of Transportation to post current bicycle and micromobility ridership data online, updated monthly or at least yearly. The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Restler, Hudson, Schulman, and others. The law demands transparency on where riders travel and what DOT does to keep them safe.
