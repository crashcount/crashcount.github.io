Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass a Volkswagen, hit it, then struck two motorcycles. The riders, Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, were thrown and later pronounced dead. The driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“He was drunk,”</a> the victim’s sister said. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“How could they let him go?”</a> Another relative asked in court. The DA is still investigating. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Police records</a> note a strong odor of alcohol and a refused test.</p><p>This happened in the footprint of Bronx Community Board 11. It did not happen in a vacuum.</p><h3 id=where-it-breaks-most>Where it breaks most</h3><p>Since 2022, CB11 has logged five deaths and hundreds of injuries. Top factors include failure to yield and the catch‑all “other,” with alcohol showing up too. City data points to repeat harm at <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bronxdale Ave</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>East Gun Hill Road</a>. Pedestrians took the brunt: three people on foot killed, 289 injured. Riders on bikes and small devices were hit 173 times. Cars and SUVs were involved in most pedestrian injuries; trucks and buses added more. These are not outliers. They are the pattern.</p><p>The clock tells its own story: injuries spike from the school and work hours into the evening, with fatalities scattered at noon, rush, and late night. Speed shows up in the files. So does inattention. The names are gone from most rows. The damage remains.</p><h3 id=faces-behind-the-numbers>Faces behind the numbers</h3><p>A 51‑year‑old woman died in a marked crosswalk at Burke and Bouck. The SUV driver was turning left. The file lists “failure to yield.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> gives no last words.<br>A 16‑year‑old girl was struck and killed at Paulding and Neill by a left‑turning box truck. The report again says “failure to yield.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>That’s the line</a>.<br>A 91‑year‑old man died at Rhinelander and Radcliff. The record is spare. It does not need help to hurt. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>One more death</a>.</p><p>On Williamsbridge Road at Pierce, a 64‑year‑old man on a bike was killed in a crash involving a pickup and a parked car. The sheet says “unspecified.” The body count does not care what we call it. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>It’s there</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-bleeding-here>What would stop the bleeding here</h3><p>The files name turning drivers. Hardened left turns, daylighting at corners, and leading pedestrian intervals at repeat sites like Bronxdale and Gun Hill would cut those hits. Truck routes and enforcement on left‑turn conflicts at Paulding/Neill and Burke/Bouck would protect walkers where trucks and SUVs are doing harm. Nighttime and rush‑hour operations should target passing and speed on the parkway and feeders. These are standard tools. They are missing where the bodies fell.</p><h3 id=citywide-locks-for-the-worst-speeders>Citywide locks for the worst speeders</h3><p>A small slice of drivers cause outsized harm. Albany has a bill to force repeat speeders to use speed‑limiting tech. The Senate’s S4045 advanced in June with yes votes from local senators. The measure would require intelligent speed assistance after a pattern of violations. The goal is simple: keep known dangerous drivers from reaching deadly speeds. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>The bill file is here</a>.</p><h3 id=slow-every-street>Slow every street</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. New York now has the power to set safer limits and has extended speed cameras around schools. But the bodies are not waiting. Use the tools. Use them here.</p><p>Bronx CB11 has names on a parkway and at quiet corners. The fixes are known. The choice is the only mystery.</p><p>Take one step that matters. Tell City Hall and Albany to act. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The wall broke. Debris rained down. No one was hurt.

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Senator Andrew Gounardes leads, joined by Leroy Comrie, Michael Gianaris, Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Robert Jackson, Liz Krueger, Zellnor Myrie, Gustavo Rivera, Julia Salazar, Luis R.

The measure, discussed in the article 'NYC residents slapped with congestion pricing ‘surcharge’ by fed-up companies paying new toll: ‘Hochul inflation’,' has sparked backlash. Queens Councilman Robert F. Holden, representing District 30, condemned the move, stating, 'It’s no surprise that businesses will pass the Congestion Scam Tax on to consumers.'

The toll stirs anger, hope, and a fight over who pays and who breathes.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2025, congestion pricing (no bill number cited) will begin in Manhattan after a federal judge allowed the toll to proceed. The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The union for FDNY EMTs argued the toll would burden low-wage workers, but data shows 90% of commuters already use public transit. City officials, including mayoral spokesperson Liz Garcia, insisted emergency response would not suffer. The measure's summary notes that reducing car traffic will speed up emergency vehicles and protect passengers.
