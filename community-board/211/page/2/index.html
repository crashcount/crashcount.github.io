Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, 1,414 neighbors have been hurt in 2,413 crashes. The dead include a 16-year-old girl, a 51-year-old woman, a 91-year-old man. Each was walking. Each was struck at an intersection. Each is gone.</p><p>The latest year brought no deaths, but the wounds keep coming. <strong>262 people injured since January.</strong> The pain does not stop.

The city lowered speed limits in some places. Cameras catch speeders, but only where the law allows. The mayor says, &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-sought-after-deadly-bronx-hit-and-run/>but the deaths keep coming</a>. The council can lower speeds to 20 mph. They have not done it citywide. The state lets cameras run, but the law is always up for renewal. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a name on a stone.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name. Act now.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Take action here.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes led the push, joined by co-sponsors Samra Brouk, Cordell Cleare, and others.
