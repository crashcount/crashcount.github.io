Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, 1,414 neighbors have been hurt in 2,413 crashes. The dead include a 16-year-old girl, a 51-year-old woman, a 91-year-old man. Each was walking. Each was struck at an intersection. Each is gone.</p><p>The latest year brought no deaths, but the wounds keep coming. <strong>262 people injured since January.</strong> The pain does not stop.

The city lowered speed limits in some places. Cameras catch speeders, but only where the law allows. The mayor says, &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-sought-after-deadly-bronx-hit-and-run/>but the deaths keep coming</a>. The council can lower speeds to 20 mph. They have not done it citywide. The state lets cameras run, but the law is always up for renewal. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a name on a stone.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name.

Metal and flesh torn in the Bronx dusk.</p><p class=mb3>On Van Nest Avenue near 606 in the Bronx, a sedan collided with a box truck that was pulling from the curb. According to the police report, the sedan's driver, a 34-year-old woman, suffered crush injuries to her shoulder, while her 33-year-old male passenger was pinned and injured in the back. Both were conscious but sustained serious injuries. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the passenger. The sedan's left front bumper struck the right side doors of the box truck, which sustained no damage. The box truck was starting from parking, while the sedan was going straight ahead. The focus remains on driver distraction as the systemic danger leading to this violent crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
