Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, 1,414 neighbors have been hurt in 2,413 crashes. The dead include a 16-year-old girl, a 51-year-old woman, a 91-year-old man. Each was walking. Each was struck at an intersection. Each is gone.</p><p>The latest year brought no deaths, but the wounds keep coming. <strong>262 people injured since January.</strong> The pain does not stop.

The city lowered speed limits in some places. Cameras catch speeders, but only where the law allows. The mayor says, &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-sought-after-deadly-bronx-hit-and-run/>but the deaths keep coming</a>. The council can lower speeds to 20 mph. They have not done it citywide. The state lets cameras run, but the law is always up for renewal. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a name on a stone.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name. Act now.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Take action here.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors. The woman suffered crush injuries to her knee and lower leg and remained conscious at the scene. The police report notes that the truck sustained no damage. The driver’s lack of a license and failure to yield to a pedestrian in the crosswalk are cited as direct causes of the crash.

Four new Metro-North stations promise faster, safer commutes. Councilmembers Marmorato and Farias back the plan. The public weighs in. The city moves closer to breaking car dependence in transit deserts.</p><p class=mb3>On January 5, 2024, the City Council held a public input session on the plan to open four new Metro-North stations in East Bronx. The proposal, nearing the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) certification, aims to serve Co-op City, Morris Park, Parkchester/Van Nest, and Hunts Point. The session, supported by Councilmember Kristy Marmorato (District 13) and Councilmember Amanda Farias, highlighted the need for faster, more reliable transit. Marmorato said, 'the Metro-North will provide an alternative for drivers dealing with congestion pricing, and for those who might be reluctant to take the subway.' Farias called it part of a 'better transit future.' The Department of City Planning updated residents, reflecting ongoing community feedback. The plan has bipartisan support and promises to reshape transit for neighborhoods long underserved by safe, fast options.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
