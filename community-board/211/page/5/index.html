Twenty-one are seriously hurt.</strong> In just over three years, Bronx Community Board 11 has seen 2,388 crashes. The numbers are blunt. <strong>One hundred thirty-nine children and teens have been injured.</strong> No one is spared—not the old, not the young, not the people just trying to cross the street.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A pedestrian was killed in a hit-and-run on a Bronx street this May. The driver fled. Police are still searching.

Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The council can act. But the clock ticks. Each day of delay is another day of risk. There is no record here of local leaders standing in the way. But there is no record of them leading the charge, either. The silence is its own answer.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong> The tools exist: lower speed limits, redesign streets, install more cameras, and enforce the law. But tools unused are as useless as promises unkept.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> Every day you wait is another day someone does not come home. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The striking vehicle, a 2013 Ford SUV traveling north, collided with the center back end of a stopped 2023 Toyota SUV. The impact caused the injured driver to lose consciousness and sustain injuries to his entire body. The driver was not ejected, and airbags deployed during the crash. The report lists "Lost Consciousness" as a contributing factor. No other driver errors such as Failure to Yield or speeding were specified.
