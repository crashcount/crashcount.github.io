Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, 1,414 neighbors have been hurt in 2,413 crashes. The dead include a 16-year-old girl, a 51-year-old woman, a 91-year-old man. Each was walking. Each was struck at an intersection. Each is gone.</p><p>The latest year brought no deaths, but the wounds keep coming. <strong>262 people injured since January.</strong> The pain does not stop.

The city lowered speed limits in some places. Cameras catch speeders, but only where the law allows. The mayor says, &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-sought-after-deadly-bronx-hit-and-run/>but the deaths keep coming</a>. The council can lower speeds to 20 mph. They have not done it citywide. The state lets cameras run, but the law is always up for renewal. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a name on a stone.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name. Act now.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Take action here.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure creates a pilot program to install speed cameras near schools, aiming to catch drivers who exceed posted limits. The authorization for the program expires December 31, 2028. Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push. The vote passed with strong support but faced opposition from several members. The bill’s summary reads: "Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2028."
